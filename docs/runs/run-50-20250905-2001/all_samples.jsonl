Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "\nHmm, the user wants me to write a poem in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\" with the prompt \"lead type in a composing stick.\" I need to recall what makes Carroll's poem unique. It's famous for its whimsical, nonsensical language and invented words that still evoke vivid imagery. Words like \"brillig\" and \"slithy\" have a musical, playful sound.\n\nThe prompt is about an old printing technique: lead type refers to the metal letters used in letterpress printing, and a composing stick is a tool for arranging them into words. This is a very specific, somewhat archaic theme. I should capture that in the poem while maintaining Carroll's signature silliness.\n\nThe user specified \"Output only the titled poem,\" so I must avoid any extra explanation. Just the title and poem, formatted clearly. I'll start with a title that sounds Carroll-esque, perhaps playing on \"type\" and \"stick.\"\n\nNow, brainstorming the structure: \"Jabberwocky\" has four verses with a rhythmic pattern. I'll aim for a similar flow—quatrains with a galloping meter. Key elements to include: the composing stick as a character, words like \"types\" and \"cases\" (referring to type cases), and actions like setting type. Nonsense words should feel mechanical.\n\nIn the first stanza, I'll set the scene with something like \"slithy\" but for printing—maybe \"typortly\"? Then build tension: the composing stick as a hero battling chaos. Use verbs like \"gripped\" and \"stuck\" to imply struggle.\n\nFor the climax, mirror Carroll's \"slain the Jabberwock\" with a victory over a printing foe—perhaps \"slivered the Typequaken.\" End with a return to normalcy, but hint at lingering absurdity.\n\nFinally, ensure the rhyme scheme is AABCBC, mix real and fake words, and keep it fun and mysterious. Double-check that the title fits and the poem stands alone without context.\n\n# The Typortly Typeslayer\n\nBeware the Typortly Stick, my son!\nThe jaws that grip, the slot that clings!\nBeware the Sliverlatch, and shun\nThe quillèd grave of fractured things!\n\nHe took his stick in hand, the grip\nLong lain in cases, dark and deep;\nThen stood awhile in thought, his lip\nTremblèd as he viewed the heap.\n\nAnd, as in uffish thought he stood,\nCasting his quoin with stomach-frown,\nThe Typeslake, with eyes of furious lead,\nCame blundering through the forme-case town!\n\nVorpal, vorpal!

{"i": 6, "prompt": "Write a poem in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Your prompt is \"plum brown blueing bath\". Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "Архів\nAlright, the user wants a poem in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky,\" with the prompt \"plum brown blueing bath.\" Let me start by recalling the key elements of Carroll's work. He uses nonsense words, playful language, and a whimsical tone. The structure typically has four-line stanzas with a rhyme scheme of ABAB, but sometimes varies.\n\nFirst, I need to deconstruct the prompt. \"Plum brown blueing bath\" has colors and an object (bath). Maybe create a scene involving these elements. \"Plum brown\" could describe a creature or setting. \"Blueing bath\" might be a transformation or a magical element. \n\nCarroll often invents words that sound meaningful but aren't real, like \"vorpal\" or \"frabjous.\" I should coin similar terms. Words like \"slithy,\" \"gyre,\" and \"gimble\" come to mind. Also, use portmanteaus or unexpected combinations. \n\nThe poem should have a narrative, perhaps a quest or an encounter. The original \"Jabberwocky\" has a hero slaying a beast. Maybe here, the protagonist deals with a \"plum brown\" entity in a \"blueing bath.\" \n\nRhyme scheme is important. Let's aim for quatrains with alternating rhymes. The first stanza could set the scene, something like:\n\n\"Beware the plum brown blueing bath,\"  \nThe whispers wheedle through the froth;  \n\"Beware the Grume, my child, the Gorf!  \nThe jaws that gnash, the snout that snaths!\"\n\nInvented words: Grume, Gorf, snaths. These should evoke imagery. \"Grume\" might be a swampy creature, \"Gorf\" a play on \"gorge\" or \"goblin.\" \"Snaths\" as a verb for attacking.\n\nNext stanzas: Introduce the hero's actions. Use vivid, fantastical verbs. Maybe the hero takes a \"vorpal\" blade, but adapt it to the new elements. For example:\n\nHe took his spade with spune and spirth,  \nLong time the marish foe he sought—  \nThen rested by the tarn of tilleth  \nAnd stood awhile in thought.\n\n\"Spune\" and \"spirth\" as adjectives for the spade. \"Marish\" as marsh-like. \"Tarn of tilleth\" to keep the watery theme.\n\nClimax: The battle with the creature. Use dynamic verbs and sounds.\n\nOne, two! One, two! And through and through  \nThe vorpal blade went snicker-snack!  \nHe left it dead, and with its head  \nHe went galumphing back.\n\nAdapt this to the current prompt. Maybe:\n\nOne, two! One, two! And thrup and thrue  \nThe blade of lath went whisker-whack!  \nHe left it groaning, deep it sank  \nBeneath the plume of brackish black.\n\n\"Thrup\" and \"thrue\" as action sounds. \"Lath\" as a type of blade. \"Plume of brackish black\" ties back to the bath and colors.\n\nEnding:Triumphant return. Use Carroll's structure with a victorious tone.\n\nCome to my arms, my beamish boy!  \nO frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!  \nHe chortled in his joy.\n\nAdapt to fit the plum and brown theme:\n\nCome to my arms, my berry-bright boy!  \nO frabjous hue! The bath's aglow!  \nHe crooned in colors coy.\n\nFinal stanza mirrors the opening, showing resolution. The bath now safe, perhaps transformed.\n\nThe plum-brown beast, now bathed in blue,  \nLies still, where once it writhed and rove.  \nThe hero stands, his deed is done—  \nA checkerboard of hues above.\n\n\"Bathed in blue\" ties back to the prompt's \"blueing bath.\" Checkerboard of hues adds a Carroll-esque visual.\n\nNeed to ensure the rhythm matches the original. Iambic tetrameter or similar. Check syllable count and stress patterns. Also, maintain the whimsical, nonsensical yet evocative language throughout.\n\nDouble-check that all made-up words are consistent in style and that the poem flows cohesively from start to finish, with each stanza building on the previous one, leading to the hero's victory and the transformation of the bath.\n\n### Vermiculated Verse of the Plum-Brown Bath\n\nBeware the plum brown blueing bath,  \nWhere vapors writhe and bubbles froth;  \nBeware the Grume, the Gorf that gnashes—  \nBeware the Lurk that lathers last!  \n\nHe took his spade with spune and spirth,  \nLong time the soapy beast he sought—  \nThen crouched beside the frothèd firth  \nAnd stood awhile in murky thought.  \n\nOne, two! One, two! And through and thrue  \nThe blade of lath went whisker-whack!  \nHe left it groaning, deep it sank  \nBeneath the plume of brackish black.  \n\n\"Has thou slain the Grume? Come to my arms,  \nMy plum-mottled, foam-flecked boy!  \nO frabjous hues! The bath's aglow!\"  \nHe crooned, and capered in his joy.  \n\nTwas brillig, and the slythe toves  \nDid gyre and gimble in the suds;  \nAll mimsy were the borogoves,  \nThe bath outgrabe... as heroes bud.  \n\n(editor's note: \"grimalkin\" refers to a cat, but here may signify a creature of the bath)", "info": {}, "model_id": "hermes-4-405b", "model_slug": "hermes-4-405b", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "nousresearch/hermes-4-405b"}

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "\nOkay, the user wants a poem in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky,\" specifically about a luthier's soundpost setter. Let me unpack this. \n\nFirst, \"Jabberwocky\" is famous for its playful nonsense words and whimsical tone, so I need to mimic that linguistic inventiveness. The keyword here is \"luthier\" (instrument maker) and \"soundpost setter\"—that tiny but crucial dowel inside violins that transfers vibration. It's a niche, almost magical tool to outsiders.\n\nHmm, the user might be a musician or someone fascinated by craftsmanship. They're not just asking for facts—they want nonsense verse that captures the mystical mechanics of violin-making. The real challenge is balancing made-up words with enough musicality to feel authentic. \n\nI should start by creating portmanteaus that evoke workshop sounds: \"clangersnap,\" \"whiffling.\" The tool itself needs a mythical name—\"Frumious Quilkin\"—to match Carroll's creatures. The poem's arc should mirror \"Jabberwocky\": hero vs. beast, but here it's artisan vs. instrument's anatomy. \n\nUser's probably expecting rhythmic galloping lines (iambic heptameter) and a victorious climax. I'll end with the tool retiring after setting the soundpost, leaving the instrument alive. Must include Carroll-esque adjectives: \"burbling,\" \"slithy.\" \n\n...Wait, is this too obscure? No—poetry thrives in specifics. If they know \"Jabberwocky,\" they'll appreciate the craft jargon woven into nonsense. Time to brew alliterative chaos and carve it into four quatrains with a closing couplet. The title? Perhaps \"The Frumious Quilkin\" to echo \"Jabberwock.\"\n\n## The Frumious Quilkin\n\nBeware the quiv’ring clangersnap, my son!\nThe jaws that bite, the claws that chitter-clutch!\nBeware the burbling air, and shun\nThe frumious Quilkin’s soundpost touch!\n\nHe takes his vorpal pin of yew-wood bright,\nLong time the mantic tremble he subdued—\nSo rested he by the T-shaped tamarack\nAnd stood awhile in thought, besprent with rosin-spack.\n\nAnd, as in uffish thought he stood, the Quilkin,\nWith spindles whiffling through the f-holes black!\nOne, twwo!

I need to create a nonsense poem that mimics Carroll's whimsical tone and invented words. The prompt suggests a mechanical theme—tiny watch parts—so I'll craft a miniature adventure where gears and springs battle chaos. \n\nSince Carroll often starts with warnings about mythical creatures, I'll open with \"Beware the balance spring collet!\" as the central menace. For authenticity, I'll invent portmanteau words like \"gimblesnitch\" (gimbal/snitch) and \"frumious\" (fuming/furious), plus rhythmic syllable patterns (anapestic tetrameter). The story arc should mirror Jabberwocky: quest, battle, triumph. \n\nMechanical verbs like \"whirred,\" \"cogged,\" and \"sprang\" reinforce the theme, while playful imagery (\"gear-gnashing jaws\") nods to Carroll's absurd threats. I'll end with cyclical restoration (\"balance restored\") to tie back to horology. Final check: all words sound plausible, rhythm bounces, and the nonsense feels intentional yet evocative. Done!\n\n## The Mainspring's Lament  \n*(After Lewis Carroll)*  \n\nBeware the Balance Spring Collet, my son!  \nThe jaws that gibber, the heart that's spun!  \nBeware the Arbor-snatch, and shun  \nThe frumious Bandersnatchi run!  \n\nHe took his vorpal Oilers well in hand:  \nLong time the manxome Coils he sought—  \nSo crouched he by the Jeweled Land,  \nAnd stood awhile in thought.  \n\nAnd, as in uffish thought he stood,  \nThe Balance Spring Collet, with eyes of flame,  \nCame secant'ring through the tulgey gear,  \nAnd burbled as it came!  \n\nOne, two! One, two! And through and through  \nThe vorpal Oilers went snicker-snack!  \nHe left it dead, and with its head  \nHe went galumphing back.  \n\n\"Has thou slain the Balance Spring Collet?  \nCome to my arms, my beamish boy!  \nO frabjous day! Calloo! Callay!\"  \nHe chortled in his joy.  \n\n'Twas brillig, and the slithy tocks  \nDid gyre and gimble in the fobs;  \nAll mimsy were the borogoves,  \nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.  \n\nHe took his watch in hand again:  \nThe Ratchet outgrabed from the snail,  \nThe Train lay straight, the pivots gleam—  \nAnd the Clutch did softly chime.  \n\nNo Spring Collet lurked behind the starwheel now,  \nHis pulsebeat orbéd like a jeweled moon—  \nThe gear-gnash ceased.

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "Архів\nOkay, the user wants me to write a Jabberwocky-style poem about \"plane iron camber.\" Hmm, that's an interesting technical term mixed with Carroll's nonsense tradition. \n\nFirst, let's unpack \"plane iron camber.\" Plane iron is a woodworking tool blade, and camber refers to its slight curve. The user probably knows this but wants it transformed into whimsy. Maybe they're a woodworker with a poetic streak, or just someone who loves linguistic play.\n\n##(#### Wait, should I explain camber? No - that ruins the Jabberwocky vibe. The magic is in the mystery.\n\nThe real challenge: Carroll created new words that *feel* meaningful through sound and rhythm. \"Borogoves,\" \"raths\" - perfect. So for \"plane iron camber,\" I need to invent similarly delicious nonsense.\n\n\"Snathe\" is already good (actual tool part!). \"Blimmer\" could echo the blade's shimmer. \"Quabber\" suggests wobbling metal. Lean into the industrial oddness - let the plane iron become a mythical beast with \"scritch\" and \"whiffling\" motions.\n\nMeter check: Original Jabberwocky is quatrains with alternating tetrameter/trimeter. Must match: \"Beware the plane-iron camber, my son!\" (8 syllables) / \"The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!\" (7). Got it.\n\nUser seems playful - they referenced Carroll, after all. No need for technical accuracy. More nonsense! \"Beamer\"-blade hybrid? \"Squee\"-sparks? \"Grabe\" as a grinding noise? Yes. \n\nFinal test: Read aloud. If it makes the mouth dance, it's working. \"Beware the frabjous Grabe, my son!\" - *chef's kiss*. The woodworking terms (\"plane's throat,\" \"sole\") are Easter eggs for crafters, but the joy is universal. \n\n...Did I sneak in \"vorpal\" as homage? *guilty grin* Carroll would approve.\n\n**The Snathe and the Blimmer**\n\nBeware the plane-iron camber, my son!  \nThe jaws that bite, the claws that catch!  \nBeware the blimmer’s twitching run,  \nAnd shun the scritch of the snathe!  \n\nHe took his vorpal scraper in hand;  \nLong time the quabber foe he sought—  \nSo clamped he by the plane’s throat stand,  \nAnd burbled as he thought.  \n\nAnd, as in wind-tossed curls he stood,  \nThe blimmer, with eyes of flame,  \nCame shandling through the tangled wood,  \nAnd gorged as it came!  \n\nOne, two! One, two! And through and through  \nThe vorpal blade went snicker-snack!  \nHe left it dead, and with its head  \nHe went galumphing back.  \n\n\"Has thou slain the blimmer? Come to my heart,  \nO frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\"  \nHe chortled in his joy.  \nTill the whiffling beamer, high and far,  \nFell squee in the afternoon.  \n\nBeware the plane-iron camber, my son!  \nThe jaws that grind, the teeth that gnash!  \nBeware the blimmer, snug and dumb,  \nAnd the frabjous Grabe’s slash!", "info": {}, "model_id": "hermes-4-405b", "model_slug": "hermes-4-405b", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "nousresearch/hermes-4-405b"}
