Similar in others: mostly lines fairly uniform in length. Less than 60% have the alternating longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content-word difference.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme for lines 2 and 4:  \nStanza 1: whelm / dreams (slant rhyme no);  \nStanza 2: bright / spins (no);  \nStanza 3: go / might (no);  \nStanza 4: friend / end (perfect rhyme).  \nOnly last stanza clearly rhymes 2 and 4; with only 4 stanzas total, one stanza with rhyme (25%) < 60%. AABB pattern not present.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza somewhat echoes the opening phrase \"And hast thou…\", mentions \"beamish\" (canonical lexicon), and calls back \"O frabjous…\" The repetition of the opening stanza is not present in full, no exactly repeated content words/phrases from first stanza; partial allusion but not a clear full ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Second stanza starts with \"Beware the searing quantum light,\" which is an explicit admonition/warning to the protagonist early in the poem.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>No stanza shows the protagonist preparing with tool, resolve, waiting, or planning before encounter. The poem skips from warning to encounter arena without explicit preparation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>The third stanza depicts the encounter: \"One, two! One, two! The currents flow, / And through and through the circuits go,\" describing a meeting/action with the adversary (\"currents,\" \"thermal dance\"). Thus, a clear encounter is present.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>No decisive slaying or action resolving tension is clearly described. The third stanza depicts flow/presence and the last stanza asks \"And hast thou caught the blazing form?\" but does not confirm slaying or resolution.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>No stanza shows a return or celebration/jubilant acknowledgement similar to the canonical poem's celebration stanza. The last stanza welcomes \"beamish friend\" and \"O frabjous heat\" but does not describe a triumphant return or homecoming.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Invented coinages distinct from the canonical set:  \n\"ebonite,\" \"heat-set,\" \"feedrate,\" \"thermal,\" \"quantum\" (though \"quantum\" is a known English/scientific word, maybe borderline, but generally accepted), \"frenzied spark,\" \"circuits,\" \"radiant,\" \"transforming\" (standard English), mostly only \"ebonite,\" \"feedrate,\" \"heat-set\" are strong coinages. Total distinct invented coinages less than 8.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>At least 1 coinage per stanza?  \n1st stanza: \"ebonite,\" \"heat-set,\" \"feedrate\"  \n2nd: \"quantum\" (known word), \"frenzied spark\" (common phrase)  \n3rd: \"currents,\" \"thermal dance,\" \"radiant might\" (common words)  \n4th: no strong coinage  \nOnly first stanza clearly shows coinages; others mostly known English/scientific or no coinage; so not every stanza has a coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named and central apart from Jabberwock?  \n\"Ebonite\" is used as adjective/noun here and central to action; no specific named creature different from canonical Jabberwock, though \"ebonite\" might be interpreted as a creature or material entity. No distinct creature named like \"Jabberwock.\" So no.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>At least 2 onomatopoeic bursts?  \nNo clear onomatopoeia like \"snicker-snack,\" \"burble,\" \"hiss!\" etc., are present in this poem. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Within stanza alliteration/consonance:  \nStanza 1: \"brillig\" / \"feedrate\" / \"thermal waves\" (some consonance)  \nStanza 2: \"pulse that flickers\" (alliteration), \"frenzied spark\" (s)  \nBut only sporadic alliteration, not clearly strong or in ≥2 stanzas. Borderline, but not clearly strong alliteration in ≥2 stanzas.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza 2) → preparation (none) → encounter (stanza 3) → decisive action (none) → return/celebration (stanza 4 partial)  \nPreparation and decisive action missing, so arc order incomplete and out of canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line verbatim from original poem. Phrases like \"'Twas brillig\" are canonical tokens but not verbatim canonical lines. No exactly repeated canonical lines.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Count of canonical tokens used:  \n\"’Twas brillig,\" \"mimsy were,\" and \"beamish\" appear once or twice, low count (≤8 tokens); consistent with favoring new coinages. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count:  \nLines generally about 8 syllables (long lines) but many lines of similar length; no clear alternation 8-9 syllables longer lines and 5-7 shorter lines throughout. Some lines roughly 8 syllables, but no consistent pattern in all stanzas.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety:  \nOnly one stanza fully rhymes (stanza 4) 2nd and 4th lines with \"friend\" / \"end.\" Others have near to no rhyme. Low rhyme variety but not repeated end words beyond 2. So acceptable for no reuse beyond 2 times, but rhyme quality weak overall.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word appears repetitively overused. Words are not excessively repeated beyond allowed frequency.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety:  \nWith few coinages overall (~3-4), distinct root count below 4, so no variety of coinage roots; mostly derivatives or standard words.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence:  \nPoem treats a creature/adversary of heat, light, and energy, with many allusions to the Jabberwocky style. Topic is parodic but clearly addresses a fantastical being and confrontation, consistent with Jabberwocky topic.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext:  \nNo coherent implied layer or motif beyond surface action is observable; mainly descriptive with no deeper undertones or motifs developed across poem.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.3333333333333333, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 0.0, "C16_arc_order": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 0.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 0.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 1.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.3333333333333333, "criteria_yes": 8, "label": "low"}

Final stanza echoes \"beamish\" and \"O frabjous day! Callooh!

No clear repeated content words/phrases internally from first stanza; no refrains mentioned there.

One, two! The blade descends…\"; line about cutting path, so yes, decisive blade action resolving tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: final stanza is a celebration (\"O frabjous day!

The poem contains \"O1's\" (unclear coined token), \"beamish\" (canonical), \"frabjous,\" \"Callooh,\" \"Callay\" (canonical), \"hollow grind\" (not canonical coinage, but phrase, \"grind\" standard English), other words standard English. No clear invented coinages except \"O1\" which seems alphanumeric rather than word coinage. Likely fewer than 8 distinct invented coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Since coinages barely present and only possibly once (O1), not in every stanza; so no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: no named creature or entity central to action except general blade and grinding path; \"O1\" not a creature. So no.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: None present; no bursts like \"snicker-snack!\", \"Pop!\", etc.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Some mild consonance (\"spinning sharp,\" \"slice symmetry's\"), but not clearly strong alliteration/consonance demonstrated in multiple stanzas beyond incidental; no evidence of strong alliteration in ≥2 stanzas.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning in 2nd stanza, then encounter in 3rd stanza, then celebration in 4th stanza — mostly arc order warning → encounter → celebration is maintained, but lacks explicit preparation and slaying breakout is merged with encounter; so partial but insufficient for clear canonical arc order (requires preparation also).</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: The refrains \"O frabjous day!

AABB dominance avoided. Passes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes opening stanza by repeating key words \"brillig\", \"beamish\", \"Come to my arms\" refrain is similar but here it echoes \"O frabjous day! Callooh!

Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named non-canonical creature/entity: \"nixie\" (digital/electronic entity) named and central to action (repeated several times and attacked). So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: limited - \"whiffling\" and \"burbled\" from canonical, but model poem also has \"clicked\" (switchblade clicked). However, \"clicked\" is a mild sound word, may count. \"One, two! One, two!\" may simulate drum or strike sounds. Only one or two onomatopoeic bursts though, borderline but at least two (\"whiffling\", \"burbled\" inherited canonical, plus \"clicked\" and \"One, two! One, two!\" as rhythmic sound). Count as yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas beyond incidental repeats: examples like \"signal-monster fought\", \"soft-lit light\", \"circuits burning\" and \"cathode tree\" show some alliteration/consonance, not very strong but some present in multiple stanzas.

Lines differ and are original though inspired. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens count ≤8, favoring new coinages: canonical lexicon used sparingly \"brillig\", \"mimsy\", \"whiffling\", \"burbled\", \"beamish\", \"snicker-snack\" (missing here), only ~5 canonical words reused; under 8.

Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no content word overused beyond 5 times or 8% content words. \"Nixie\" repeated but fits narrative, no other word overused excessively. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages show multiple distinct roots (\"nixie\", \"signal\", \"quantum\", \"cathode\", \"switch\", \"soft-lit\"), no dominant suffix >50%, so yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: clearly addresses \"Jabberwocky\"-style poem but with a digital/electronic theme, explicitly naming and describing the nixie creature and its slaying, matching overall expected topic. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: implied themes of technology replacing fantasy, light and circuits replacing woods, digital age vs old myth, some undertone of man versus machine or quest in an electronic realm, a coherent implied layer detected.

{"i": 48, "prompt": "Write a poem in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Your prompt is \"split‑grade enlarger burn\". Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "The Split-Grade Enlarger Burn\n\n'Twas brillig in the darkroom's gloom,\nThe chemicals did swirl and bloom,\nAll mimsy were the papers laid,\nWhere silver shadows slow cascade.\n\nBeware the split-grade's mystic light,\nThe burning tones that slice so bright!\nThe dodging hands that twist and bend,\nWith contrast sharp from end to end.\n\nOne, two! One, two! The exposure creeps,\nThe negative its secret keeps.\nThe image forms with careful might,\nAnd bathes itself in pure delight.\n\n\"And hast thou made the perfect print?\nCome to my arms, my beamish boy!\nO frabjous day! Kallooh! Kalay!\"\nThe art of light shall have its say.", "info": {}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>Title line present before first stanza: “The Split-Grade Enlarger Burn” clearly a title line separate from stanza text.</C1_think>\n<C2_think>Stanzas: 4 total; all stanzas have 4 lines each, but total stanza count is 4 which is less than the required minimum 5.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter alternation: Only 4 stanzas. The lines do not clearly alternate longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content-word difference; line lengths seem relatively uniform and do not clearly match ballad meter pattern in ≥60% stanzas.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme (2,4): In first two stanzas, rhyme on lines 2 and 4 is strong (“gloom”/“bloom”, “bright”/“end” slant rhymes less exact but acceptable). The 3rd stanza rhymes 2,4 with “might”/“delight” strong rhyme. 4th stanza: “boy” vs “say” / “Kallooh!” / “Kalay!” less consistent. So rhyme consistent ≥60%. AABB not dominant since mostly ABCB; so criterion met.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza echoes some phrases from canonical poem (“Come to my arms, my beamish boy!” “O frabjous day!”) but not from the model opening. No clear repeated phrase from opening stanza or refrain from poem’s own opening stanza. Ring composition is based on echo or repeated content words/phrases. Without strong opening-final echo in this poem itself, no ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning or admonition early: The 2nd stanza opens with “Beware the split-grade’s mystic light,” meets the admonition criterion for an early warning/caution to protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: The poem shows “dodging hands that twist and bend”, “careful might” forming the image; this suggests some preparation or deliberate process before climax; however, no explicit tool/resolve/wait/plan described before the encounter. The “One, two! One, two!” line counts as rhythmic action not clearly preparation. The poem lacks explicit preparation like in canonical poem. So borderline, but likely no.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: The poem describes the exposure (“One, two! One, two! The exposure creeps”) and image formation, but no adversary or obstacle encountered or met; no battle with a creature or adversary. The poem is about a process, not a confrontation.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: No decisive act resolving tension or defeating adversary described. Image \"forms with careful might\" but no clear climactic decisive action.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: The last stanza includes celebratory tone “O frabjous day!” and “Come to my arms, my beamish boy!”, indicating celebration or joyful acknowledgement after process. Return is metaphorical but fit this criterion.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: “brillig” is canonical, but “split-grade”, “enlarger”, “dodging” etc. are normal English words. No evident coinages or invented words distinct from normal English. The poem uses very few or no invented coinages. Definitely less than 8 distinct coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage per stanza: Since no coinages found, no stanza contains at least one.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central to action: No named creature or non-canonical entity; the poem is about photographic process, no creature featured.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: No onomatopoeic bursts like “snicker-snack!” or “Hiss!” present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Some internal alliteration possible (“silver shadows slow cascade”), but no strong or multiple stanzas with clear alliteration beyond incidental; given poem brevity, probably no.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The poem has admonition (yes), then a vague exposure process (not clear preparation), no encounter, no decisive action, then celebration. Arc is out of canonical order and incomplete.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: Some lines match canonical poem exactly or slightly altered: “’Twas brillig,” opening is canonical phrase, as well as “Come to my arms, my beamish boy!”, “O frabjous day!” etc. Lines from canonical poem are reused or close paraphrases. But since exact lines present, criterion fails.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token budget: Uses several canonical words like brillig, mimsy, beamish, frabjous etc., but total distinct canonical tokens ≤8, not a problem.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines generally ~8-9 syllables, shorter lines ~6. Approximate ballad meter observed.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhyme pairs mostly unique across stanzas; no end word reused >2 times excluding repeated phrases. Rhyme variety acceptable.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No content word appears overused beyond threshold. No overuse detected.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: No coinages found, so does not meet minimal root variety criterion.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The topic seems to be a photographic darkroom process, with references to “split-grade”, “burn”, “silver shadows.” This is not the canonical Jabberwocky theme; although the poem uses Jabberwocky-like language and style, it substitutes a different subject, not the Jabberwock or the mythical quest. So no.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem suggests metaphor about art, craftsmanship, struggle and triumph in creating a perfect print, an undertone of artistic process and mastery. Coherent implied layer detectable.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>no</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.375, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 0.0, "C16_arc_order": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 0.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 0.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 0.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 1.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.375, "criteria_yes": 9, "label": "low"}
