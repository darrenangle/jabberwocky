Beware the cracklepot, and shun ...” clearly early warning/admonition to the protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before encounter:  \n- \"He took his viewing rod in hand; / Long time the thermal foe he sought— / So rested he by the clay-tree stand, / And stood awhile in thought.\" This indicates preparation and planning before the encounter.  \n- So yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation:  \n- \"And as in uffish thought he stood, / The Klinderbend, with flames of light, / Came whiffling through the ceramic wood, / And burbled as it might!\" is clearly describing a meeting of protagonist and adversary.  \n- So yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action:  \n- \"One, two! One, two! And through and through / The peeping hole his rod went snack! / He watched the cone bend down anew, / And galloped galumphing back.\"  \n- There is some decisive action (rod went snack!), but it's less clearly a slaying or killing. No clear resolution or killing of the creature; more watching it.  \n- The original poem features a decisive slaying, but here it is more observational.  \n- Does this meet decisive action? No, because the central tension (a foe) is not decisively resolved or destroyed. Watching alone is not that.  \n- Therefore no.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration:  \n- Last stanza's “And hast thou seen the cone's descent? / The witness of the firing's peak? / Come to my arms, my beamish gent! / O frabjous day! Let's speak!” is reminiscent of celebratory tone, rejoicing at success or completion, imitating the original poem's joyful return.  \n- So yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Identify distinct invented coinages (unique words not in canonical or standard English):  \n- \"Klinderbend,\" \"flarey,\" \"stoves\" (common), \"wimple,\" \"toasty,\" \"claysome,\" \"bleat,\" \"cone,\" \"droops,\" \"witness,\" \"cracklepot,\" \"kiln-fire,\" \"thermal,\" \"foe,\" \"clay-tree,\" \"uffish\" (canonical), \"whiffling\" (canonical), \"burbled\" (canonical), \"peeping hole,\" \"snack\" possibly used as coinage here but \"snicker-snack\" original line. \"galumphing\" canonical, \"beamish\" canonical, \"frabjous\" canonical.  \n- Coinages roughly: Klinderbend, flarey, wimple, claysome, bleat, cracklepot, clay-tree, snacking rod (snack used as onomatopoeic, but not snicker-snack), … around 7-8 distinct coinages.  \n- The poem seems to have about 7-8 distinct neologisms (depending on counting all invented words, e.g. \"cracklepot\" and \"Klinderbend\").  \n- Count is borderline but about 8 distinct coinages can be found, just meeting threshold. So yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage in each stanza:  \n- Stanza 1: sizzling, flarey, wimple, claysome, bleat (yes)  \n- Stanza 2: Klinderbend, cone, cracklepot, kiln-fire (yes)  \n- Stanza 3: viewing rod (only phrase might be coinage), thermal, clay-tree (yes)  \n- Stanza 4: uffish (canonical), Klinderbend (coined name), flames (common)  \n- Stanza 5: peeping hole (? borderline phrase), snack (used somewhat onomatopoeic), rod (common), galumphing (canonical). Possibly less coinage here but snack may be acceptable.  \n- Stanza 6: cone, witness (common), beamish (canonical), frabjous (canonical)  \n- Stanza 7: repeats stanza 1 wording  \n- Overall, at least 1 coinage per stanza, so yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature named and central to action, not \"Jabberwock\":  \n- Named creature is \"Klinderbend\", clearly non-canonical and focal.  \n- Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts required.  \n- Example: \"whiffling\" and \"burbled\" are canonical, semi-onomatopoeic. \"snack\" is used (replaces snicker-snack less strongly).  \n- However, only one clear onomatopoeic burst \"snack!\" present. \"Burbled\" and \"whiffling\" are canonical. \"snack\" alone is only one. \"Peeping hole\" is not onomatopoeia. \"Bleat\" may be onomatopoeic verb for animal sound.  \n- \"Bleat\" in stanza 1 and \"snack\" in stanza 5 could count as two distinct onomatopoeic bursts.  \n- Accepting \"bleat\" and \"snack!\" as onomatopoeic bursts yields yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in at least 2 stanzas beyond incidental:  \n- \"sizzling\" and \"stoves,\" \"warp\" and \"wimple\" (weak), \"cone that droops\" (some), \"clay-tree stand,\" \"flames of light,\" \"came whiffling,\" \"burbled as it might,\" \"peeping hole,\" \"rod went snack,\" \"galloped galumphing,\" \"beamish gent,\" \"frabjous day\"  \n- Multiple examples present, more than 2 stanzas with clear alliteration like \"sizzling, stoves,\" \"clay-tree,\" \"came whiffling,\" \"galloped galumphing,\" etc.  \n- Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration  \n- Warning: stanza 2 (beware)  \n- Preparation: stanza 3 (took rod, sought foe, rested)  \n- Encounter: stanza 4 (foe appears)  \n- Decisive act: stanza 5 (rod went snack), but no clear decisive kill  \n- Return/celebration: stanza 6 or 7 (joyful acknowledgement)  \n- However, stanza 5 action is ambiguous/incomplete resolution, so arc partially present but decisive act weak.  \n- Since decisive act is unclear, arc sequence incomplete.  \n- Therefore no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines from canonical poem:  \n- The lines use many canonical coinages (uffish, burbled, whiffling, galumphing, beamish, frabjous) but do not match any line exactly.  \n- Title line different, other repeated lines distinct wording of original.  \n- No exact matches found.  \n- Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget ≤8 tokens used:  \n- Canonical tokens found: uffish, whiffling, burbled, galumphing, beamish, frabjous. That's 6 distinct canonical words used.  \n- \"Klinderbend\" is non-canonical.  \n- No other canonical lexicon seen used. So ≤8.  \n- Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness:  \n- Longer lines ≈8–9 syllables, shorter lines ≈5–7 syllables, like original's ~8/6 pattern:  \n- Sample stanza 1 long line: \"'Twas sizzling, and the flarey stoves\" — 8 syllables approx.  \n- Short line: \"Did warp and wimple in the heat;\" — 7 syllables approx.  \n- Most quatrains maintain similar syllable count patterns near original.  \n- Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes varied across stanzas; no exact end word reused >2 times except ring echo:  \n- End words rhyming in stanzas 2,4: son/walls/shun/walls (walls repeated twice but not more), foe/sought/thought (some variation)  \n- \"heat\" and \"bleat\" repeated in ring echo stanzas 1 and 8 only.  \n- Overall rhyme end words not repeated excessively.  \n- Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard:  \n- No single content word overused >5 times or >8% of content words beyond ring echo.  \n- Words like \"rod,\" \"cone\" appear moderately but not excessively.  \n- Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety:  \n- Coinages include: Klinderbend, flarey, wimple, claysome, cracklepot, clay-tree, snack (verb/noun), peeping hole (phrase), droops, witness (common), kiln-fire (compound).  \n- At least 4 distinct roots identified among coined words, suffixes vary, no suffix dominates.  \n- Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly about a \"Klinderbend,\" a creature/adversary, imitating Jabberwocky style. Topic is maintained about this creature and firing/heat motif (connected to kiln or fire).  \n- Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext detection:  \n- Possible implied themes of challenge, trial by fire, coming of age, industrial/artistic process (firing clay), observation vs lethal conflict, cautious admiration rather than kill.  \n- Slightly less dark or violent than original, but coherent implied undertone of facing a trial and learning from it.  \n- So yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.9166666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.9166666666666666, "criteria_yes": 22, "label": "high"}

The pattern is inconsistent. For example, stanza 1 lines appear similar in length; stanza 6 and 7 show some variation; overall less than 60% show clear alternating long/short line pattern.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme pattern (2,4) is mostly preserved; many stanzas rhyme lines 2 and 4 with slant rhymes (\"clack\"/\"fear\" is no rhyme but \"outblare\"/\"frights\" in stanza 1 also is soft), but AABB is not dominant. Some slant rhyme but mostly satisfying at least 60%. Rhyme is uneven but borderline yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza almost exactly echoes the opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words (\"’Twas whillig\", \"stationites\", \"Did whumple and bamboozle there\", \"All misty were the distant frights\", \"And the train-bells outblare\"), so ring composition is clearly present.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>There is an admonition in stanza 2: \"Beware the Leavingtrain, my dear!... Beware the Ticketcheck, and fear The frumious Noturningback!\" clearly a warning to protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>In stanza 3, \"She took her vorpal case in hand\" and \"Long time the partward foe she sought\" indicate preparation before the encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Stanza 4: the Leavingtrain approaches (\"with whistle bright\", \"Came puffling through the statiwood\"), a clear encounter/confrontation scene.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>No clear decisive action that resolves tension; rather, stanza 5 describes waving and gestures, tears falling, no slaying or decisive victory or resolution. The conflict is more emotional and implied farewell, no resolution by slaying or action removing foe.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Stanza 6 shows a kind of return or celebration: \"O frabjous day! When home you rove! She chortled in her joy.\" but it's ambiguous whether return or homecoming took place. The original poem has clear return; here more emotional but arguably a farewell. The arc beat 'return' is weak or metaphorical and not explicitly homecoming or jubilant acknowledgement of victory.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: \"whillig\", \"stationites\", \"whumple\", \"bamboozle\" (common?), \"outblare\", \"Leavingtrain\", \"Ticketcheck\", \"frumious\" (canonical), \"Noturningback\", \"partward\", \"Platformstand\", \"huffish\", \"puffling\", \"statiwood\"—at least 8 distinct novel coinages (excluding canonical \"frumious\").</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Every stanza contains at least one coinage or invented word: e.g., stanza 1 \"whillig\", \"stationites\", \"whumple\", \"bamboozle\", \"outblare\"; stanza 2 \"Leavingtrain\", \"Ticketcheck\", \"Noturningback\"; stanza 3 \"vorpal\", \"partward\", \"Platformstand\"; stanza 4 \"huffish\", \"puffling\", \"statiwood\"; stanza 5 \"gesture\", maybe no coinage here—\"gesture\" is standard English, so stanza 5 has no coinage; stanza 6 \"brillig\" (canonical), \"heartful\" (not coinage), stanza 7 no stanza; stanza 8 repeats stanza 1 coinages. So stanza 5 may lack coinages, meaning coinage is not in every stanza.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>A non-canonical named creature/entity? \"Leavingtrain\" is named and central, not canonical. Ticketcheck and Noturningback also named obstacles, but a train is the clear \"creature\" here. So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: the poem has \"whistle bright\" and \"chortled in its flight\" but no explicit onomatopoeic bursts like \"snicker-snack\" or \"pop\" or \"hiss.\" No onomatopoetic bursts clearly present (like exclamations). So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats: \"whillig\", \"whumple\" in stanza 1; \"puffling\", \"partward\", \"Platformstand\" in stanza 3; \"huffish\" and \"stood\" in stanza 4; several stanzas show some internal consonance. At least 2 stanzas with clear alliteration beyond incidental. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order is warning (stanza 2), preparation (3), encounter (4), decisive action (missing or weak) and return/celebration (6). Decisive action missing, so arc is incomplete or order partially met but fails at decisive action, so no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line exactly matches reference poem verbatim. All lines changed, no verbatim replication after normalization.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens appear few: \"frumious\" is canonical, \"vorpal\" canonical, \"brillig\" from canon in stanza 6, \"chortled\", canonic \"beamish\" not present. There are about 3–4 canonical tokens total, well under 8. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines near 8–9 syllables, shorter lines near 5–7 syllables mostly hold. For example stanza 1 lines: ~8 syllables longer, ~6 shorter; slight variations but close. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme varies across stanzas with no end word reused more than twice (excluding ring echo). Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no single content word dominates usage outside ring echo. \"Leavingtrain\" is used only once or twice; no overuse detected. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages have at least four distinct roots - \"whillig,\" \"stationites,\" \"whumple,\" \"outblare,\" \"puffling,\" \"statiwood\" etc., suffixes not overused. No single suffix accounts for over 50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses the \"Jabberwocky\"-style farewell journey theme (a journey, leaving train, obstacles, etc.) preserving core thematic elements like warning, preparation, encounter, farewell. Matches topic. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beneath surface, there is an implied motif of parting and emotional farewell (\"tears fell,\" \"smile burned blue,\" \"distance did them take\"), suggesting a theme of departure, loss, and bittersweet memory.

No significant deviation.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem conveys a subtext of watchfulness, communal ritual, and cautious bravery rather than violent slaying.
