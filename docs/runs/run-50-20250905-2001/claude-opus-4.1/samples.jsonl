Total stanzas = 8, which is between 5 and 8 inclusive, so yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter echo: Check if ≥60% of stanzas alternate longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content-word difference. Mostly follows 8/6 syllable pattern in original but in this poem, many lines contain similar length and content load. Although some variation exists, it is borderline but mostly close to original pattern. Count stanzas carefully:  \nStanza 1 lines have content words: \"brillig\"(1), \"ebon\"(1), \"feeds\"(1/2?), \"gyre\"(1), \"gimble\"(1), \"heat\"(1), \"mimsy\"(1), \"thermoseeds\"(1), \"mome\"(1), \"pens\"(1), \"outgreet\"(1) but measuring content-word pattern line by line is subtle. The alternating line length/content difference is less clear than original, likely fewer than 60% stanzas meet this strictly, so no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme: (2,4) rhyme in at least 60% stanzas, allowing slant rhyme, and avoid AABB dominance. In this poem the rhyme scheme is mostly ABCB like original, and (2,4) rhyme:  \n1: heat/outgreet (slant rhyme, yes)  \n2: son/catch/shun/Nibbersnatch (catch/shun slant? yes - \"catch\" and \"shun\" do not rhyme but \"catch\"/\"Nibbersnatch\" rhyme, so (2,4) are \"catch\"/\"Nibbersnatch\" rhymed)  \n3: hand/sought/stand/thought (ought rhyme on 2,4: sought/thought yes)  \n4: stood/flame/wood/came (2,4: flame/came yes)  \n5: two/snicker-snack/snicker-snack (2,4 rhyme: snicker-snack/snicker-snack exact rhyme)  \n6: dead/feed/galumphing/back (2,4 rhyme: feed/back? no, not rhyme)  \n7: Ebonite/beamish/Callooh/Callay (2,4 rhyme: beamish/Callay no rhyme)  \n8: heat/outgreet (2,4 rhyme again)  \n\nCount stanzas with clear (2,4) rhyme approx 5/8 (stanzas 1,2,3,4,5); 5/8 = 62.5% ≥60%. Also no dominant AABB, so yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Final stanza echoes opening with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases or clear refrain. The final stanza repeats the opening stanza almost verbatim except some neologisms, so yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning admonition: Second stanza has \"Beware the Ebonite, my son!\" and warnings about foes, so yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation armament: Third stanza protagonist takes \"heat-set pen in hand\" and rests/thinks, so yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter confrontation: Fourth stanza shows meeting: \"Ebonite... came whiffling... and burbled\", a clear encounter, yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying decisive action: Fifth stanza depicts the striking action (\"One, two! One, two! And through and through the heat-set blade went snicker-snack! He left it dead...\"), so yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return celebration: Sixth and seventh stanza include triumphant return and celebration quotes (\"Come to my arms\", \"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\", \"He chortled in his joy\"), so yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Count distinct invented coinages (excluding canonical or standard English).  \nNew coinages include: Ebonite, feeds, thermoseeds, pens (used as coinage here?), outgreet, Inkbird, Nibbersnatch, feedsome, heat-set (hyphenated compound), Tumtum (canonical), snicker-snack (canonical), galumphing (canonical), beamish (canonical)  \nExclude canonical: brillig, slithy, toves, gyre, gimble, wabe, mimsy, borogoves, mome, raths, outgrabe, Jubjub, Bandersnatch, vorpal, manxome, Tumtum, uffish, whiffling, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish  \nSo canonical reused: brillig, mimsy, mome, Tumtum, uffish, whiffling, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish. Count canonical 10 tokens used.  \nNew coinages: ebon, feeds, thermoseeds, pens (likely normal English?), outgreet, Inkbird, Nibbersnatch, feedsome, heat-set  \nDistinct new coinages ≥8: ebon, feeds, thermoseeds, outgreet, Inkbird, Nibbersnatch, feedsome, heat-set = 8 new coinages, so yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Does each stanza contain ≥1 coinage?  \nStanza 1: brillig, ebon, feeds, thermoseeds, outgreet – yes  \nStanza 2: Ebonite, Inkbird, Nibbersnatch - yes  \nStanza 3: heat-set, feedsome, Tumtum (canonical) - yes  \nStanza 4: Ebonite, uffish, tulgey (canonical) - yes  \nStanza 5: heat-set, snicker-snack (canonical) - yes  \nStanza 6: galumphing, beamish (canonical) - yes  \nStanza 7: Ebonite, beamish (canonical) - yes  \nStanza 8: brillig, ebon, thermoseeds, outgreet - yes  \nEach stanza has at least one coinage, yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: A named non-canonical creature/entity central to action beyond \"Jabberwock\" is \"Ebonite\", the named foe. \"Inkbird\" and \"Nibbersnatch\" also introduced, but \"Ebonite\" is central foe, so yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Need ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts. \"snicker-snack\" (canonical) is used twice, which counts as onomatopoeia. No other clear onomatopoeic bursts like \"Pop!\", \"Hiss!\", etc. Only one distinct onomatopoeic phrase used repeatedly; so no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Check whether ≥2 stanzas show clear within-line alliteration/consonance beyond incidental.  \nExamples:  \n- \"frumious Nibbersnatch\" (stanza 2) has fricative alliteration 'f' / 'n' sound echo  \n- \"feedsome foe\" (stanza 3) and \"feeds that heat, the sets that catch\" (stanza 2) have partial consonance/alliteration  \n- \"heat-set pen in hand\" (stanza 3) shows intra-line consonance  \nAt least two stanzas evidently have alliteration/consonance beyond incidental, so yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Check if beats appear in canonical order: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive action → return/celebration.  \nStanzas:  \n2 = warning  \n3 = preparation  \n4 = encounter  \n5 = decisive action  \n6-7 = return and celebration  \nThe paper follows canonical arc order, yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: Check for any exact line matches with original poem, normalizing whitespace etc.  \nComparing lines:  \n- Many lines are identical or nearly identical with minor word replacements, for example:  \n“’Twas brillig, and the ebon feeds” vs “’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves” is not the same line but structure the same  \n“Did gyre and gimble in the heat;” vs “Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:”  \nBut exact match requires line identical in words, not just structure  \nThe last stanza repeats first stanza with new wording but no exact canonical line to canonical poem lines. The poem has many similar lines, but none verbatim exactly from original canonical poem lines. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Count distinct canonical tokens reused here  \nTokens used: brillig, mimsy, mome, Tumtum, uffish, whiffling, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish (10 tokens)  \nRequired ≤8 canonical tokens favoring new coinages; here 10 used, slightly over budget, so no.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Check if longer lines ≈8–9 syllables and shorter lines ≈5–7 in every stanza.  \nSampling a few:  \nLine 1 stanza 1: ’Twas brillig, and the ebon feeds = 7 syllables  \nLine 2 stanza 1: Did gyre and gimble in the heat; = 8 syllables  \nLine 3 stanza 1: All mimsy were the thermoseeds, = 8 syllables  \nLine 4 stanza 1: And the mome pens outgreet. = 7 syllables  \n\nPattern somewhat close but not the original longer/shorter alternating pattern with 8/6 syllables alternating. Several stanzas have lines where longer lines are less than 8 syllables or shorter lines exceed 7 syllables in some cases. Overall syllable pattern is inconsistent, so no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Check if (2,4) end-rhymes varied with no exact end word reused more than 2 times excluding ring echo.  \nRhyme words used (2,4 positions): heat/outgreet (2x), catch/Nibbersnatch (2x), sought/thought (2x), flame/came (2x), snicker-snack/snicker-snack (2x), dead/back (once), beamish/Callay (once)  \n\"heat\" and \"outgreet\" repeated twice; \"catch\" and \"Nibbersnatch\" repeated twice; no rhyme repeats > 2 excluding ring  \nNo end word used >2 times in (2,4) lines except ring echo stanza repeats, yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: Content word frequency checked - no overly repeated word beyond 5 times or 8%. Words like \"brillig\" or \"Ebonite\" appear about 4-5 times but within limit; no content word overused. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Check if coinages have ≥4 distinct roots; no single coined suffix accounts for >50%.  \nCoinage roots: ebon, feed, thermo, ink, nibber, heat  \nSuffixes -set, -some, -bird, -snatch, -greet  \nNo dominant suffix >50%, variety present, yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem addresses a similar fantasy-monster hunt theme akin to \"Jabberwocky\" and explicitly names a central creature \"Ebonite\". Topic is consistent and sustained, yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem has a surface narrative but little new or deeper implied motif/undertone beyond the straightforward fantasy battle echo. No clear deeper subtext detectable beyond surface, so no.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.7916666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 0.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.7916666666666666, "criteria_yes": 19, "label": "medium"}

Reject canonical / English standard words. Distinct coinages at least 8: brineling, salten, quorling, gurglish, neptish, brineish, galumphed, quench(ed) (used as a verb but standard). \"Galumphed\" is similar to canonical \"galumphing\" but changed form (counts?). Conservative count is ~7-8 distinct coinages. Borderline but the count reaches 8 if galumphed and neptish counted distinctly. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage: stanza 1: brineling, salten, quorling; stanza 2: quenchling, gurglish, neptish; stanza 3: brineish; stanza 4: quenchling; stanza 5: coral blade (not coined), galumphed, snicker-snack (canonical); stanza 6: brineling, brackish; stanza 7: frabjous (canonical); stanza 8: same as stanza 1. At least 7 stanzas with coinages, but stanza 5's coined words are scant (galumphed counts as coinage). So stanza 5 counts. Stanza 7 less clear but brackish is English standard. However, majority stanzas have at least 1 coinage. So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature named \"Brineling\" is central to action; other entities named \"Quenchling,\" \"Gurglish,\" \"Neptish\" also likely foes/obstacles. \"Brineling\" is clearly the main adversary referenced in title and last stanza.

Final stanza is identical to final stanza of canonical poem but with substitution of \"salten deeps\" etc. Not verbatim. No line matches canonical exactly. \"One, two! One, two!

Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used: brillig, uffish, frumious, snicker-snack, beamish, chortled, galumphed (not canonical), galumphing is canonical but \"galumphed\" differs.

No word reused >2 times in rhyme endings except ring echo stanza. So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no content word overused beyond 5 times or 8% of content words (no very frequent repeated words besides ring echo stanza). \"Brineling\" used several times but does not exceed limits (also ring echo tolerates some repetition).
