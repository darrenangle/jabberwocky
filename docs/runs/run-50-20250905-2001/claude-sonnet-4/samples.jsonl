So yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter: Need ≥60% stanzas with alternating longer/shorter lines showing ≥2 content word difference. Lines have a somewhat even rhythm, but the alternating length pattern (as in Jabberwocky) is not strongly evident in most stanzas. Only about 3 or fewer stanzas show clear alternating line lengths with content word count difference. Below 60%, so no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme (2,4 lines rhyming) in ≥60% stanzas and avoiding AABB. Checking rhyme: stanzas mostly have (2,4) rhyme; predominant pattern looks like ABAB or ABAB-type with slant rhyme. No dominant AABB. At least 5/7 stanzas have proper (2,4) rhyme, so yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza echoes the opening stanza with repeated structure and some repeated content words (\"’Twas brillig\", \"moonbeams pale\", \"garden wall\").

Clear encounter present. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/Decisive action: Unlike Jabberwocky, no battle or act of slaying occurs. The tension resolves with the flower blooming and fading, no violent or decisive action that resolves tension. No.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/Celebration: Final stanza shows return to quiet (moonbeams fade), \"told their tale—one night of magic, worth it all\" implies a positive acknowledgment or celebration of experience. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: \"Cereuswatch\" as coinage or coined term; other coinages or invented words are minimal or none. Mostly standard English or canonical lexical items. Less than 8 distinct invented coinages. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Since there are few or just one coinage, most stanzas lack coinages. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature Naming: \"The Cereuswatch\" is a coined non-canonical creature/entity. The plant \"cereus\" and \"cereuswatch\" act as the named entity central to the poem. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: No clear onomatopoeic bursts like \"snicker-snack\" or \"burbled.\" No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/Consonance: Some light alliteration (\"moonbeams pale,\" \"buds began,\" \"petals pale\"), but not clear strong alliteration in ≥2 stanzas. Only mild/incidental, so No.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning (stanza 2), preparation (stanza 3), encounter (stanza 4), no killing/decisive action (missing), return/celebration (stanza 7). Arc mostly correct but slaying absent, breaking canonical beat sequence. No.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: Poem repeats \"'Twas brillig,\" shows some canonical lines reused verbatim or slight modification: first and last stanzas strongly echo canonical lines. At least 4 lines match canonical poem exactly or nearly exactly (e.g., \"'Twas brillig,\" \"Did ... in the wabe,\" \"All mimsy were the borogoves,\" \"And the mome raths outgrabe\"). Therefore, verbatim line present means No.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget (distinct canonical tokens ≤8): Uses \"'Twas brillig\" and \"’Twas brillig\" in title and last stanza, but no other canonical coinages. Only 'brillig' repeated, moonbeams etc. So canonical tokens under 8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines roughly 8-9 syllables, shorter 5-7 per stanza lines. Checking samples: some longer lines slightly under or over by one syllable, but generally close to Jabberwocky pattern. So acceptable. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The (2,4) rhyme words are fairly varied across stanzas; no exact end word repeats more than twice (excluding ring echo). Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No obvious overuse of content words exceeding limits. Word usage seems balanced. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Very limited coinages (mainly \"Cereuswatch\"). No variety or multiple distinct roots. No.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: While using different subject (a flower blooming and fading), poem clearly follows a Jabberwocky-style narrative (warning, quest, encounter). Topic is somewhat different but fits poetic style rather than substituting an unrelated subject. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Coherent implied layer about transience and preciousness of beauty, evoking fleeting magic of night bloom; subtle undertone throughout.

This counts as altered, not exact. Except the last stanza repeats canonical lines but substitutes new coinages. So no lines exactly match the canonical poem verbatim in wording or spacing once normalized. No exact verbatim lines.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens appear multiple times: brillig, slithy, mome, raths, outgrabe, manxome, vorpal, uffish, tulgey, whiffling, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish, frabjous, callooh, callay, Jubjub. Canonical tokens are >8 total appearing. So canonical lexicon is slightly over budget.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Line syllable counts consistent with jabberwocky pattern approx 8–9 syllables for longer lines and 5–7 for shorter lines; the \"snicker-snack\" lines have shorter syllable counts ~6; longer lines mostly 8–9 syllables. Met in all stanzas.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety good: rhyme words in line 2 and 4 differ across stanzas with no overuse of same rhyme word >2 times, excluded ring echo. Example rhymes \"wabe/outgrabe\", \"catch/shun\", \"sought/thought\", \"flame/came\", \"snicker-snack/back\", \"Regletty/beamish\", \"joy\", \"outgrabe\" repeated only in ring echo.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No excessive lexical repetition outside ring echo; content words are varied; “Regletty” repeated but is a named entity, acceptable. No word appears >5 times or >8% outside ring echo.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety mostly in suffix roots: reglet(s), furniture-ettes, Bannerlatch, Regletty — three different roots mainly. Canonical coinages fill some quota. Possibly borderline under variety threshold requiring ≥4 distinct roots in coinages (only about 3 distinct roots in new coinages).</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence is good; poem clearly addresses parody of Jabberwocky naming a creature \"Regletty\" and echoing Jabberwocky style and arc. No topic substitution.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/motif implied parallels original: a child's adventure, warning against danger, triumph, celebration.
