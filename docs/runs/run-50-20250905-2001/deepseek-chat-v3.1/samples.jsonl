All are quatrains.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter: Jabberwocky uses alternating meter with longer and shorter lines differing in content words. Here, many stanzas show alternating longer/shorter lines, difference in content word counts ≥2 in most stanzas; at least 5 of 8 stanzas conform clearly. Meets ≥60% threshold.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme: Lines 2 and 4 rhyme or have slant rhyme in most stanzas (e.g., \"wake\" / \"quake\", \"imp\" / \"eschew\" less clear but mostly rhyming pairs or close).

Reglet is main adversary, so yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Words like \"snick-snick\" and \"burbled\" (from canonical, but burbled is canonical, snick-snick is invented) – at least 2 onomatopoeic bursts present, including repeated bursts \"One-two!

At least two stanzas demonstrate clear alliteration beyond incidental repeats.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The canonical arc is followed clearly: warning in stanza 2, preparation in stanza 3, encounter in stanza 4/5, decisive action stanza 6, return/celebration stanza 7, ring echoed stanza 8. Order is canonical.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: Lines are reworded; for example, the canonical \"’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\" changed to \"’Twas gribble, and the slivered spoons\". No line matches exactly canonical.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Canonical tokens like \"vorpal\", \"beamish\", \"burbled\", \"snicker-snack\" are minimal (5 or less distinct canonical tokens). Other words are new coinages or regular English. So canonical token count ≤8.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Lines alternate longer (~8-9 syllables) and shorter (~5-7 syllables).

Most stanzas follow 8/6 or close pattern in longer/shorter lines.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhyme pairs for lines 2/4 vary with no obvious repetition of end words >2 times, and distinct rhymes like wake/quake, crimp/eschew (near rhyme), imp/eschew, brass/pass, snick-snick/quick, joy/day. No problematic repetition.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overused excessively; common words like \"the\" or \"and\" are distinct from content words. Coinages and key content words are not repeated more than 5 times or 8%.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages appear from at least 4 distinct morphological roots and suffixes: e.g., \"gribble\", \"slivered\", \"spoones\", \"carpet-looms\", \"armchair-quogues\", \"Reglet\", \"guffulous\", \"snick-snick\", \"flumphing\". No single suffix dominates >50% of coinages.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly adheres to the Jabberwocky theme of a fearful creature encounter, adventure, and victory; no substitution of unrelated topics. The known words replaced with furniture-related coinages but the core Jabberwocky arc is followed closely and coherently.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: As in Jabberwocky, a motif of bravery, coming-of-age, or triumph over a fearful foe is present in underlying tone.
