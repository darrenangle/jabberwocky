There are more than 8 clearly distinct invented coined words excluding standard English. Furniture is normal English word but 'Reglet', 'plurp', 'thwacking', 'gnashy-clash', 'zanker-bright' etc. are distinct coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza has at least one invented coinage word: e.g. 'quinky' (1st), 'Reglet'/'spoondle-fern' (2nd), 'grumble-tool' (3rd), 'moxied'/'thwacking' (4th), 'gnashy-clash'/'barfed' (5th), 'bulb-spry'/'goyly-goon'/'zanker-bright'/'Fliploo'/'Partick'/'whiffled' (6th), and last stanza repeats first.

So yes, all stanzas contain ≥1 coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creature is \"Dustlick Jumble,\" a non-canonical, invented creature central to action (not Jabberwock), matching requirement.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts: \"sneeze!\" and \"squeak\" suggest sounds, also \"frooped\" and \"gribble\" have sound qualities; specifically \"sneeze\" and \"squeak\" are recognizable onomatopoeia bursts, at least 2 are present clearly.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance is clear in multiple stanzas, e.g. stanza 1 \"pluckly\" and \"slidy strings\", \"squeak and gribble\", stanza 2 \"teeth that gum, the stichtzle sneeze\", \"pinch your nostrils, squeeze\", stanza 5 \"gripple smudge\", \"powdery bite\". Multiple stanzas show deliberate consonant/alliterative patterns.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc beats appear in canonical order: warning in stanza 2; preparation in stanza 3; encounter in 4; decisive action in 5; return/celebration in 6; ring echo in 8. Sequence is proper.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line exactly matches any canonical Jabberwocky line. All lines are distinct in wording; closest repetition is ring echo but with new coined words.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Distinct canonical tokens mostly absent except for a few (e.g., \"beamish\", maybe \"vorpal\" is referenced but with coinages added, no direct canonical words are used from the reference except \"beamish\"). Canonical token count is under or equal to 8 (likely 1 or 2 at most). So it favors new coinages.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Line length closely aligns with Jabberwocky: longer lines ~8–9 syllables (e.g. ‘Did squeak and gribble thin’ = 6, but ‘All slipzome were the bow-hair frizzes’ = ≈8 syllables), shorter lines ~5–7 (e.g. “Blown out by rosined chin” = 6 syllables). This pattern holds in each stanza consistently.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety in 2/4 lines across stanzas is varied: rhymes like \"thin\"/\"chin\", \"sneeze\"/\"squeeze\", \"sight\"/\"bite\" recur few times but not excessively. No rhyme word is repeated more than twice excluding ring echo. Variety is acceptable.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word overused excessively; no apparent content word occurs >5 times or ≫8%. Words are spread among coinages and normal words; no problematic lexical repetition.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages come from many distinct roots: \"pluckly\", \"slidy\", \"slipzome\", \"Dustlick\", \"Jumble\", \"stichtzle\", \"Stratch-snuff\", \"gloombly\", \"snootle\", \"gripple\", \"astra-crumple-fudge\", \"frobonium\", etc. Multiple root varieties present, no one suffix or root dominates >50% coinages.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem clearly addresses a nonsense creature encounter theme in the style of Jabberwocky; topic aligns perfectly to the prompt and reference poem's style and theme.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Beyond surface story, poem implies theme of confrontation and mastery over an unruly adversary (here musical string dust), with undertones of artistry and care (rosin preparation, string maintenance).
