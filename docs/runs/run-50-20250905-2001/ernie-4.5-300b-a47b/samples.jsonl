Canonical tokens less than or equal to 8, with significant new coinages used. -> yes</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines should be about 8-9 syllables, shorter lines 5-7 syllables as per Jabberwocky’s ~8/6 pattern.

Most have 4 lines, but the first stanza has 4 lines, the second stanza has 4 lines (\"He took his Vorpel...\" to \"...the mire doth grave.\" counting carefully), the third stanza has 4 lines (\"One, two! One, two!...\" to \"He fled, half-mad...\"), the fourth stanza has 4 lines (\"And hast thou slain...\" to \"...a sorrowsong\"), the fifth stanza has 4 lines (\"So twas he roved...\" to \"...the Witness’s death\"), the sixth stanza appears to have 4 lines but actually it is longer: \"—O frabjous day! The sky did glow,\" \"While Blip and Bork in chaos go.\" \"The Cone’s last curve, now cold, sublime…\" \"…The Kiln’s black hearth, no more, in time.\" So all stanzas have four lines. Stanza count is 6, which is between 5 and 8. So yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter echo: Determine if in ≥60% of stanzas, lines alternate longer/shorter with ≥2 content-word difference. The poem's lines have moderate syllable variation, but clear alternating long/short pattern is not obvious or consistent. The difference between lines 1 and 2 or 3 and 4 is not clearly following the strict Jabberwocky ~8/6 syllable pattern in 4 lines per stanza. Tentatively no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme (2,4) rhyming in ≥60% of stanzas and avoiding AABB dominance: The rhymes are mostly slant (\"gleam\"/\"stream\", \"rave\"/\"grave\", \"threw\"/\"slew\" or \"dim\"/\"whim\") but mostly present at 2 and 4 lines. All 6 stanzas appear to rhyme lines 2 and 4 to some extent; however, some full rhyme or near rhyme is clear. No strong AABB pattern dominance. Yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition - final stanza echoes opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases or a clear refrain: The final stanza repeats phrases like \"Cone’s last curve\", \"Kiln’s black hearth\" but no evident repetition of opening stanza content words like “Beware the Kiln, glimbrick’s flame,\" or \"Witness Cone\". No obvious ring repetition. No.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition early: The first stanza starts with \"Beware the Kiln...\" clearly a warning/admonition phrase. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament before encounter: The second stanza narrates taking \"Vorpel\" (weapon/tool) and going through places; this is preparation and taking tool. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: There is a confrontation (the \"Cone\", \"Zollop\", \"Blinkets\") and battle (\"He slunk through shades\", \"One, two! One, two! And through and through, The Vorpel’s kin he swerved and slew\"). So yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive act: The poem has a decisive killing/slaying action (\"The Vorpel’s kin he swerved and slew\", \"He vanquished void, the Witness’s death\"). Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: There is some joy in \"He chuckled grim\", \"O frabjous day! The sky did glow,\", \"his laughter rang\", indicating some celebration. Return is mentioned vaguely, but \"So twas he roved…\" and \"He fled\" somewhat cover this. Since there are celebratory elements and implicit return, yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Coined words distinct and ≥8: glimbrick, Witness, Zollop, Fizzle, Slurp, Vorpel, Bloop, Chorfling, Blinkets, Wastrel, Jibber, ghoulis, Glint, Gloom, Blip, Bork, sorrowsong, etc. Definitely more than 8 distinct invented words. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza contains ≥1 coinage word: 1st stanza (glimbrick, Zollop, Fizzle, Slurp), 2nd (Vorpel, Bloop, Chorfling, Blinkets), 3rd (Vorpel’s kin), 4th (Kiln’s design,火 (fire) - though fire is canonical English but a Chinese character, Jibber), 5th (ghoulis, Glint, Gloom, Witness), 6th (Blip, Bork, Kiln). Each stanza has coinage. Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named and central to action but not canonical and not \"Jabberwock\": Named entities include \"Kiln,\" \"Witness Cone,\" \"Zollop,\" \"Fizzle,\" \"Blinkets,\" etc. The central adversary seems to be \"the Kiln\" / \"Witness Cone\". This is a non-canonical named creature/entity central to action. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Words like \"Chorfling’s cry!\" suggest onomatopoeic bursts. Also, \"One, two! One, two!\" is a rhythmic phrase suggestive of sound. \"Fizzle\" is onomatopoeic. Probably at least two onomatopoeic bursts: \"Chorfling’s cry!\" and \"Fizzle’s gleam\" (though gleam is not onomatopoeic). Be cautious: \"Chorfling\" and \"Fizzle\" can count. So yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas: Examples: \"Kiln’s Glee\", \"glimbrick’s flame\", \"Slurp’s deep\", \"Vorpel, wrought\", \"Wastrel’s whim\", \"Blip and Bork in chaos\". Multiple instances. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order in canonical sequence warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration: The poem opens with the warning, then preparation with Vorpel, then encounter with the enemy, then decisive slaying, then a celebration/return stanza. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines from canonical poem: No lines appear verbatim from the original Jabberwocky poem. Some key phrases like \"One, two! One, two! And through and through\" are reused but \"One, two! One, two! And through and through\" is the exact phrase from the original poem, so this counts as verbatim use; thus this criterion fails. No.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget ≤8: The poem uses \"O frabjous day!\", \"One, two! One, two!\", \"snicker-snack!\" is absent but similar phrase; however, the phrase \"One, two! One, two! And through and through,\" is canonical token used. Also \"O frabjous day!\" repeats canonical tokens. Overall canonical tokens fewer than 8 distinct? Phrases like \"One, two! One, two!\" \"O frabjous day!\" involve canonical tokens but few distinct canonical tokens used in limited scope. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness in quatrains: Long lines typically 8-9 syllables, shorter lines 5-7 syllables. The poem has moderate variation but not tightly matching Jabberwocky’s syllable pattern. Some lines longer or shorter, line lengths vary unevenly. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety of (2,4): Rhyme endings seem mostly distinct, not repeated more than twice, with exception of repeated internal words does not appear excessive. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overused excessively. The text is varied. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety ≥4 distinct roots, no dominant suffix over 50%: Coinages vary widely with many distinct root words (\"glimbrick\", \"Zollop\", \"Fizzle\", \"Slurp\", \"Vorpel\", \"Bloop\", \"Chorfling\", \"Blinkets\", \"Jibber\", \"ghoulis\", \"Glint\", \"Gloom\", \"Blip\", \"Bork\"). No single suffix dominates. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem concerns an adventure-like battle with a named creature (Kiln, Witness Cone) reminiscent of the Jabberwocky theme, i.e., similar subject with battle against a creature. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext beyond surface: There is some implied undertone of struggle, void vs life, or chaos; also “Kiln’s design” and “wastrel’s whim” suggests an existential undertone.

At least 2 stanzas show clear alliteration/consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning/admonition stanza 2, then quickly encounter stanza 3, then decisive action stanza 3, then return celebration stanza 4 and 5; fits canonical arc order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines match canonical poem verbatim. Some close words like “snicker-snack,” “vorpal blade,” but no exact full line matches. Safe to say no verbatim lines.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token usage is low: uses “vorpal,” “snicker-snack,” “frumious” is borderline canonical, others invented; well under 8 distinct canonical tokens.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts: lines alternate longer (~8-9 syllables) and shorter (~5-7). Some lines slightly short or longer, e.g. stanza 1 lines (9,8,8,5) roughly fit; others less tight but mostly consistent. Meets criterion.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme mostly varies; identical rhymes “lurk/lurk” once, others differ; no exact reuse > 2 times excluding ring echo. Rhyme variety acceptable.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No overuse of single content word beyond threshold; spreads coinages and common words with small repetition. Good lexical diversity.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages differ in roots (urushi, glizb, murklights, voidazun, fadooks, cystel, swinkers, brangled, glim) with no dominant suffix accounting for >50%. Meets criterion.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Clearly about a Jabberwocky-style poem with “Urushi Vorpal,” a creature confrontation and slaying. Matches expected theme.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: faint implied undertone of peaceful resolution (“Rejoice!

Not exact phrase repetition, but at least 2 repeated content words \"brillig\", \"borogoves\" and a similar opening structure suggest a ring composition -> yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Second stanza contains a clear warning: “Beware the Jubjub, snarl! beware!” and a further admonition about Bandersnatch’s glare, so yes an early admonition is present.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Third stanza shows preparation: \"He took his vorpal spade in hand\", \"Then scraped the earth\", \"Till fragrant trails his noces brought\" - protagonist prepares for encounter -> yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Fourth stanza depicts encounter/confrontation: \"And, as in uffish thought he stood\", \"The Jubjub whiffed…\", \"One gulp! two whiffs! the civet coo’d\" - clear meeting present -> yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive act visible? The civet coos and then vanishes, protagonist’s gleeful cry \"Has thou? …\" suggests after encounter, but no killer strike like \"snicker-snack\", or explicit slaying action shown.

Calloo! Callay!”  \nHe chortled in his mirthful lay,  \nAs the scribe line, now bold and bright,  \nDanced through the page, a wyrd delight.  \n\nThe kiridashi, in its keen embrace,  \nScribed tales of time, of night, of space,  \nWith every curve, a lexicon born,  \nTill morning’s blush the paper adorned.  \n\nSo twist your tongue and let it slide,  \nWhere kirids and ken blend far and wide,  \nIn scribe line’s waltz, both real and quaint,  \nThe pen still sings, though world’s domain’s faint.", "info": {"topic": "kiridashi scribe line"}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>Title is present as a non-empty line before the first stanza: \"The Blade’s Bewilderous Verse\"</C1_think>\n<C2_think>There are 5 stanzas, but they are not quatrains. The stanzas have 4, 4, 4, 4, and 4 lines? Actually counting lines per stanza:  \n1) 4 lines  \n2) 4 lines  \n3) 4 lines  \n4) 4 lines  \n5) 4 lines  \nSo 5 stanzas all with 4 lines = yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter requires alternating longer/shorter lines within each stanza with ≥2 content words difference. Scanning lines shows no clear alternation of longer and shorter lines or evident content word difference by ≥2 in majority of stanzas. Majority of lines have similar length and rhythm. No consistent alternating line length pattern seen. Less than 60% stanzas meet this => no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Check rhyme pattern on lines (2,4) of stanzas for rhyme or slant rhyme.  \nStanza 1: twirled / away - no rhyme  \nStanza 2: stark / gleam - no rhyme  \nStanza 3: lay / bright - no rhyme  \nStanza 4: embrace / born - no rhyme  \nStanza 5: slide / quaint - no rhyme  \nNone have (2,4) rhyme strongly. So less than 60% => no. Also no avoidance of AABB dominance issue (none rhyme).</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The last stanza does not echo the first with repeated content words or clear refrain. Different vocabulary and no repeated lines or phrases. No ring composition => no.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition/warning is present in stanza 2: \"Beware the ink...\" matches the \"Beware\" admonition style => yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>The protagonist preparing before encounter: In stanza 4: \"The kiridashi, in its keen embrace, Scribed tales...\" suggests action but no explicit preparation or waiting/planning before an encounter. No clear preparation of tool/resolve/waiting/planning before confrontation. No. </C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter confrontation: no clear meeting between protagonist and adversary is described. The poem is about writing with the blade (kiridashi) and an ink blade metaphor, but no explicit adversary or obstacle meeting is presented. No clear confrontation => no.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action resolving tension: no fight or conflict resolution or slaying occurs. The poem is more of a descriptive or metaphorical scene about writing, no climax of decisive action => no.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: stanza 3 has a celebratory tone (\"O frabjous day! Calloo! Callay! He chortled...\") which resembles celebration, but it happens early and no return/homecoming. No clear return theme or homecoming jubilation. Likely no.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented coinages (non-canonical/nonstandard words), ignoring canonical lexicon from Jabberwocky. Examples: kiridashi, gilson, shadow-swirls, mimsy (canonical), jabberwock (canonical), frumious (canonical), whiffling (canonical), vapory, frabjous (canonical), lay (no), wyrd, kirids, ken, quaint. Coinages: kiridashi, gilson, shadow-swirls, vapory, wyrd, kirids, ken. That's 7 distinct coinages. Not reaching ≥8 => no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Does each stanza contain ≥1 coinage?  \nStanza 1: kiridashi, gilson, shadow-swirls - yes  \nStanza 2: jabberwock, frumious, whiffling (canonical), vapory - yes  \nStanza 3: frabjous (canonical), calloo/callay (canonical), wyrd (invented) - yes  \nStanza 4: kiridashi (recurring), keen embrace (no), lexicon (standard) - yes  \nStanza 5: kirids, ken, quaint - yes  \nAll 5 stanzas contain coinage => yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature named and central: No non-canonical creature/entity named and central besides canonical 'jabberwock' mention (in stanza 2). No new creatures. No => no.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia presence: None detected like 'snicker-snack', 'burble', or bursts of sound words. No => no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats:  \nStanza 1 has 'scribe line twirled', 'shadow-swirls' = some alliteration in stanza 1  \nStanza 5 'twist your tongue' = clear alliteration  \nAt least 2 stanzas with clear alliteration => yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The canonical arc is warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration  \nHere:  \nStanza 2 is admonition (warning)  \nNo clear preparation before confrontation  \nNo clear encounter  \nNo decisive action  \nSome celebration tone in stanza 3 but very early and out of narrative order  \nArc beats not in correct canonical order => no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines exactly match canonical poem lines. The poem has similar references but no verbatim lines detected => yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens count and budget: uses canonical words: mimsy(yes), jabberwock (no, not in text but mentioned in stanza 2), frumious (yes), whiffling, frabjous, calloo/callay, chortled, beamish (no), snicker-snack (no)... Actually no 'jabberwock' word found, but 'jabberwock edge' in stanza 2 which counts as canonical. Total canonical tokens ≤8? The poem uses mimsy(1), jabberwock(1), frumious(1), whiffling(1), frabjous(1), calloo(1), callay(1), chortled(1), which is exactly 8 canonical tokens total => yes</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness (long lines ~8-9, short lines ~5-7) per stanza alternating as per Jabberwocky. Checking stanza 1 Line 1: ’Twas kiridashi, and the scribe line twirled (approx 9 syllables)  \nLine 2: Through gilson’s glade the shadow-swirls unfurled (9 syll)  \nNo alternating shorter line in stanza 1, others similar. Pattern not met consistently in majority of stanzas => no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety in (2,4): Already no rhyme, so variety not applicable but definitely not poor - no repetition of end words beyond ring (no ring). So technically yes, but since rhymes absent no variety relevant—do not count as rhyme variety? Instructions unclear but rhyme is judged by (2,4) rhymes. Since no rhymes, variety irrelevant but no repeated end words => yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No single content word overused excessively. Vocabulary is varied, so yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: 7 coinages with distinct roots: kiridashi, gilson, shadow-swirls, vapory, wyrd, kirids, ken. Distinct roots at least 4. No single suffix dominates. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem addresses a writing blade and ink metaphor connected to \"Jabberwocky\" style, not the original Jabberwock creature or the original poem's topic of a creature slaying. Poem respects stylistic imitation but shifts subject to writing tools. However, no explicit external topic was provided. Since the evaluation is for matching style of Jabberwocky, poem substitutes subject (writing) rather than original fantastical monster battle topic. Topic adherence to Jabberwocky subject is 'no'.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond surface, poem explores metaphor of writing as mystical and powerful, underlying creative process. Implied motif coherent throughout => yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>no</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.4583333333333333, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 0.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 1.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.4583333333333333, "criteria_yes": 11, "label": "low"}
