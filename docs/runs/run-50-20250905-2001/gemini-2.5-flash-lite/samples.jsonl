Phrases differ, words differ, so no verbatim lines -> yes</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens count: The poem uses some canonical tokens: \"Beware\", \"vorpal\" is missing, \"bandersnatch,\" \"jabberwock\" etc. are replaced by new terms; only small incidence of canonical vocabulary possibly \"beware\" and \"frabjous\" (no \"frabjous\" but \"frabjous day\" changed to \"frabjous day\").  \n\"Beware\" and \"frabjous\" (in line 6) are canonical and count as tokens; count ≤8 tokens total in poem. Here used \"Beware\", \"O frabjous day\", \"Callooh Callay\" variant spelled differently, still countable as canonical lexicon? \"Caloh, Cahay\" is not canonical.  \nCanonical tokens ≤8 is true here -> yes</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness:  \nChecking line lengths in stanzas showing alternating longer (~8-9) and shorter (~5-7) lines roughly:  \nExample stanza 1:  \n'Twas pliant brown, the bluing bath, (7 syll)  \nAnd gurgled with a sigh. (6 syll)  \nThe plum did slither, smooth and lath, (8 syll)  \nBeneath a milky sky. (6 syll)  \nPattern roughly matches (≈8/6); others roughly similar but less exact; overall meets the standard in the vast majority of stanzas. -> yes</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety:  \nRhyme pairs at 2,4 are mostly different end words (bath/sky, teem/dream, quest/vest, afar/delight(no), bath/wrath, boy/joy, sigh/sky). No rhyme word repeats more than 2 times except final stanza echo allowed. So rhyme variety is good -> yes</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition:  \nNo evident excessive repeats of any single content word >5 times or >8% of content words. Words \"bath\" appears multiple times but not over threshold -> yes</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety:  \nToo few coinages total (only a couple clear ones), so no variety of roots >4 -> no</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence:  \nThe poem deals with a \"Plum Brown Bluing Bath,\" echoing the original poem's monster hunt structure, so topic of confronting an obstacle/creature analog is present, though changed to an object. The explicit topic was \"whether it matches the style of Jabberwocky.\" The poem imitates style and arc with a surreal bath as antagonist; topic adherence is clear -> yes</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext:  \nImplied subtext about purification or cleansing, caution about strange bath, journey into strange state, emotional joy on completion. A subtle undertone of confrontation with discomfort or transformation; thus a coherent subtext or motif is detectable -> yes</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.625, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 0.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.625, "criteria_yes": 15, "label": "medium"}

Stanza 8 is nearly the same as stanza 1, and stanza 8 mirrors stanza 1 and stanza 8 of the canonical poem closely except the addition of \"them\" at the end of the last line. Since at least one line matches a canonical line exactly ignoring small changes (like addition of \"them\"), the strictness requires exact equality ignoring punctuation/spaces. The very last line \"And the mome raths outgrabe them.\" vs canonical \"And the mome raths outgrabe.\" is a difference. So no lines match exactly the canonical poem.

With a clatter and thump,\nHe scaled up the rock face, each sinew did jump.\nThe carabiners sang, in a rhythmical hum,\nAs he conquered the heights, now a victor to come!\n\nHe paused at the ledge, where the eagles did soar,\nAnd the world spread below, a magnificent floor.\nNo longer he feared, that old piton scar's bite,\nFor he'd faced down the chasm, and conquered the height!\n\n'Twas in the old piton scar, his spirit took flight,\nA legend reborn, in the dawning of light.\nSo triumphantly cheered, the climbers below,\nAs he stood on the peak, with a jubilant glow!", "info": {}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>Title is present: \"The Old Piton Scar\" is a non-empty title line before the first stanza.</C1_think>\n<C2_think>Stanza count is 7, all quatrains (4 lines each), which falls between 5 and 8 stanzas inclusive.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter variation like the Jabberwocky's ballad meter (alternating longer and shorter lines with ≥2 content-word difference) is not clearly evident in ≥60% of stanzas;

thus no clear rhyme pattern matching Jabberwocky’s characteristic slant rhyme in ≥60% of stanzas.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza repeats \"’Twas in the old piton scar\" phrase echoing the first stanza line—this fulfills ring composition with ≥2 content words repeated.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>The poem contains an admonition early on (\"Beware, beware the old piton scar\") which clearly warns protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation is present: protagonist seizes stout pick and ties sling before ascent, showing armament and planning.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>There is a clear encounter/confrontation: climbing and facing the dangers of the old piton scar and the grim cavern, threats implied in the admonition and presence of the chasm.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action present: protagonist climbs and conquers the rock face; the act of conquering resolves the tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration present: \"triumphantly cheered, the climbers below,\" protagonist stands on peak with jubilant glow, reflecting celebration and homecoming-like acknowledgment.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: \"piton,\" \"gullets,\" \"chimeras,\" \"mimsy\" (borrowed canonical?), \"gullets\" possibly ordinary, \"chimeras\" is a known mythological word, so not an invented coinage; total distinct coinages fewer than 8 invented. \"Mimsy\" is canonical, \"gullets\" is standard English, \"chimeras\" is not invented, so likely fewer than 8 distinct invented coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Not every stanza contains an invented coinage: first stanza has \"mimsy\" (canonical) and \"gullets\" (normal word), \"chimeras\" (mythological, not invented); later stanzas unclear on coinage in every stanza; thus no clear presence of ≥1 coinage in every stanza.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>No named non-canonical creature/entity appears central: “old piton scar” is place;

no clear onomatopoeia of ≥2 bursts.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance is subtle or absent; no clear demonstration in ≥2 stanzas beyond incidental repetition.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: admonition (\"Beware...\"), preparation (gear ready), encounter (climbing scar and dangers), decisive action (conquering rock face), return (celebration at summit); arc appears in canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines verbatim match the canonical poem lines after normalizing punctuation/spaces; all lines are original.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens present only as \"mimsy\" and “Beware,” so fewer than or around 8 canonical tokens, favoring new words and standard English.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines do not consistently fit ~8-9 syllables, and shorter lines do not consistently fit ~5-7; meter is loose and inconsistent.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety poor: rhyme words at line 2 and 4 seem often repeated or simple; the rhyme endings repeat (scar, grim/skim, descend/wend, etc), not varied enough across stanzas.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: no excessive repetition of a single content word; no content word used more than 5 times or beyond reasonable share.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety unproven: coinages are few and mostly standard or mythological words; no variety of distinct invented roots, so no strong coinage variety.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly addresses the theme of climbing a dangerous rock face (\"old piton scar\"), respecting the theme of a Jabberwocky-like quest, so the topic has been adapted but evidently sustained.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: implied undertone of overcoming fear and conquering danger is coherent across poem;

Coinage presence per stanza yes, but no invented coinages.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: The named creature is \"Fishtail Gorge,\" which is a location or entity replacing Jabberwock. It is named, central to action. However, it is not a non-canonical *creature/entity* distinct from the original, but a place-name used as adversary. Partially borderline, but since it is the adversary/obstacle and named, counts as yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"snicker-snack\" and \"burbled\" included as canonical onomatopoeic bursts, more than 2 onomatopoeic bursts present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Multiple stanzas contain alliteration beyond incidental repeats (e.g., \"slithy toves,\" \"bandersnatch,\" \"whiffling,\" \"burbled,\" \"beamish\"). At least 2 stanzas with alliteration are clear.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The sequence warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration is followed closely as in canonical, with minor wording differences but order strictly maintained.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim lines: Many lines exactly match canonical poem (e.g., first stanza repeated verbatim except semicolon/punctuation). Since any line exactly matching canonical causes NO, here multiple lines are exact matches including the final stanza and first stanza unchanged, and several others.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens count is high because the poem mostly reuses canonical lexicon and lines directly; no new coinages and canonical lexicon is fully present; canonical tokens >8 definitely; so passes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Lines mostly match original meter as canonical lines are reused verbatim; longer lines ~8-9 syllables, shorter ~6 as in Jabberwocky.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Because many stanzas repeat canonical rhyme words, some end-words repeat 3-4 times (\"wabe,\" \"outgrabe,\" \"catch,\" \"shun,\" \"Bandersnatch\"). Slightly over 2 reuse but it's canonical repetition allowed for ring composition. No problematic overuse outside ring echoes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: Content words repeated reflect canonical poem vocabulary; no content word overused beyond 5 times or 8% of content words.
