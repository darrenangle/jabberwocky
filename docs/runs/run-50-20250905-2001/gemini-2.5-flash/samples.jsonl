Last stanza is same as first stanza with minor word change (\"outgrew\" vs \"outgrabe\"); shared words: \"'Twas\", \"plum-brown\" vs \"brillig\" (changed), \"bubble,\" \"mimsy,\" \"bath-room drums,\" \"mome raths,\" \"outgrew\" vs \"outgrabe\"—at least 3-4 key content words repeated; yes ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present? stanza 2 has \"Beware the Plum-Blueing Bath, my son! The dye that streaks, the stain that clings! Beware the mildewed drain, and shun The scrubbing brush that sings!\" - explicit warning/admonition; yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation or armament before encounter? stanza 3: \"He took his loofah… Long time the sudsy foe he sought— So rested he by the shower’s arc, And burbled in lazy thought.\" Explicit preparation/waiting/planning with tool (loofah) before encounter; yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter with adversary? stanza 4 describes meeting \"The Plum-Blueing Bath, with fumes aflame, Came whiffling through the plumbing wood, And gurgled as it came!\"; yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive act resolving tension? stanza 5: \"One, two! One, two! And through and through The loofah sponge went snicker-snack! It left the stain, the murky hue, And left it to come back!\" The decisive act is scrubbing with loofah (\"snicker-snack!\"); yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration? stanza 6 has celebratory tone: '\"And hast thou plumbed the Blueing Bath? Come to my arms, my beamish boy! O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\" He chortled in his joy.' yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Number of distinct invented coinages ≥8? Coinages: \"plum-brown,\" \"gloopy,\" \"blorb,\" \"bath-room drums\" (compound?), \"outgrew\" (variation on \"outgrabe\"? borderline, but different form), \"Plum-Blueing Bath,\" \"mildewed drain,\" \"scrubbing brush\" (scrubbing brush is English but part of phrase), \"whiffling,\" \"gurgled,\" \"snicker-snack,\" \"plumbed\" (pun?), \"beamish,\" \"frabjous,\" \"callooh,\" \"callay,\" \"burbled\" (only \"burbled\" is canonical). Actually \"whiffling,\" \"snicker-snack,\" \"beamish,\" \"frabjous,\" \"callooh,\" \"callay,\" \"burbled\" are canonical. But \"plum-brown,\" \"gloopy,\" \"blorb,\" \"bath-room drums,\" \"outgrew\" (variant), \"Plum-Blueing Bath,\" \"plumbed\" (used as verb) appear new. Count distinct coinages, excluding canonical: probably 5-6 new distinct coined roots, less than 8. Hence no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Does each stanza have ≥1 coinage? First and last stanza have coinages (\"plum-brown,\" \"gloopy,\" \"blorb,\" \"outgrew\"); stanza 2: \"Plum-Blueing Bath,\" \"mildewed\" (standard), \"scrubbing\" (standard), no coinage? Probably \"Plum-Blueing Bath\" as coined entity; yes. Stanza 3: \"burbled\" canonical; loofah standard; \"sudsy\" standard adjective. So no coinage? Stanza 4: \"whiffling\" canonical, \"plumbing wood\" (plumbing is standard). line 4 \"gurgled\" (could be onomatopoeic; is that considered coinage? \"gurgled\" is standard English; likely no coinage new root. Stanza 5: \"snicker-snack!\" canonical; \"murky hue\" standard; no coinage; stanza 6: \"beamish\" canonical, \"frabjous\" canonical; stanza 7 same as stanza 1; stanza 8 same as stanza 1. So only 5 of 8 stanzas have coinages, less than 100%; no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Is a non-canonical creature/entity named and central to the action? \"Plum-Blueing Bath\" is the named central adversary, distinct from canonical Jabberwock; yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Are there ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts? \"snicker-snack!\" is canonical, repeated once. \"burbled\" is canonical but not a burst. \"gurgled\" is standard verb, not really onomatopoeic burst. \"blorb\" is coined and might count as onomatopoeia? Possibly only one clear onomatopoeic burst (\"snicker-snack!\"). No clear second onomatopoeia burst; no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Are there ≥2 stanzas with clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental? Stanza 1: \"plum-brown,\" \"gloopy plums,\" \"bubble and blorb,\" - plosive and consonant repetition. Stanza 2: \"stain that clings,\" \"scrubbing brush that sings,\" clear alliteration on 's' sounds. So yes, multiple stanzas demonstrate this.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration. The poem follows: stanza 2 admonition; stanza 3 preparation; stanza 4 encounter; stanza 5 decisive act; stanza 6 return/celebration. Yes, canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines? \"All mimsy were the bath-room drums\" replaces \"All mimsy were the borogoves\"; \"And the mome raths outgrew\" replaces \"And the mome raths outgrabe.\" These are altered. Other lines mostly differ. No exact matches to canonical lines after normalization; yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token count ≤8, favoring new coinages. Canonical tokens present: mimsy (repeated), mome, raths, outgrew (variant of outgrabe), burbled, whiffling, snicker-snack, beamish, frabjous, callooh, callay - many canonical words are kept. This is >8 canonical tokens. So no.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Check syllable tightness: longer lines ~8–9 syllables, shorter lines ~5–7, alternating. Sample stanza 1:\n\nLine1: '’Twas plum-brown, and the gloopy plums' = 8 syllables.\n\nLine2: 'Did bubble and blorb in the foamy brew;' = 9? Maybe 8; (Did bub-ble and blorb in the foam-y brew) = 9 syllables; longer than expected shorter line.\n\nLine3: 'All mimsy were the bath-room drums,' = 7 syllables.\n\nLine4: 'And the mome raths outgrew.' = 6 syllables.\n\nSome variance but roughly within bounds. Majority of stanzas appear to roughly hold alternation of syllable counts and approximate 8/6 pattern; yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Are (2,4) rhymes varied with no exact repetition of end rhyme words >2 times (besides ring echo)? Rhyme words: \"brew/outgrew\" (x2, stanza 1 and 8), \"clings/sings\", \"arc/thought\"(no rhyme), \"flame/came,\" \"snicker-snack\"/\"hue\"(no rhyme), \"boy/joy,\" \"brew/outgrew\" again. \"brew/outgrew\" appears 3 times counting ring echo (twice identical, plus repeated at stanza 8). Without ring echo, repeated twice only, so okay. No other end words appear more than twice. So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: any content word overused >5 times or >8%? Key repeated content words: \"plum-brown,\" \"mome,\" \"raths,\" \"bath-room,\" \"outgrew\" appear multiple but none seem overused heavily. Probably no word exceeds threshold. yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: ≥4 distinct roots among coinages; coinages such as \"plum-brown,\" \"gloopy,\" \"blorb,\" \"Plum-Blueing Bath,\" presumably distinct roots. Coined suffixes limited. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly addresses similar topic as 'Jabberwocky' style poem with a creature-like adversary called \"Plum-Blueing Bath.\" The theme is adapted, but maintains attack and adversary motif; yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/implied layer: possibly stain removal struggle as metaphor for challenge; undertone of battling cleansing or decay; consistent undertone throughout; yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.8333333333333334, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.8333333333333334, "criteria_yes": 20, "label": "high"}

The first stanza has 4 lines, but many others have more than 4 lines (e.g., second stanza has 4 lines, third stanza 4 lines, fourth stanza 4 lines, fifth stanza 4 lines, sixth stanza 4 lines, seventh stanza has 4 lines). However the poem mixes punctuation and line breaks; but mainly the poem lines often run together, using semicolons and commas mid-line. The stanza count is 7, within 5-8. Each stanza's line structure is somewhat disrupted (some run-on lines), but at least 5 stanzas appear quatrains. However, some stanzas have 5 or more lines (\"And, as in uffish thought he stood, the Tinsmith, with eyes of flame, / Came whiffling ... and burbled ...\"). So not all stanzas strictly 4 lines; probably more like 6 stanzas around 4 lines, 1 stanza with 5+ lines. So no, all stanzas do not have 4 lines strictly.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>The original poem uses ballad meter alternating long and short lines (~8 then ~6 syllables). The model poem largely copies canonical lines with canonical meter; but since many lines are combined or run together with punctuation, hard to say if lines alternate syllabically with ≥2 content word difference in ≥60% of stanzas. Given frequent run-ons this is borderline but seems not clearly met due to lack of clear line separation and irregular length. So 'no.'</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme in 'Jabberwocky' is mainly ABCB in quatrains, with (2,4) rhyming. In the model poem, second and fourth lines in many stanzas rhyme or slant rhyme.

Stanza 2: \"catch\" and \"Bandersnatch\" rhyme; stanza 3 unclear; stanza 4 \"flame\"/\"came\" rhyme; stanza 5 \"snicker-snack\"/\"back\"; stanza 6 \"boy\"/\"joy\"; stanza 7 \"wabe\"/\"outgrabe\" again. These meet rhyme(2,4) in ≥60% stanzas. Also no AABB dominance (some use repeated rhyme words, e.g., \"catch/Bandersnatch\" but not AABB). So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza echoes the opening stanza almost verbatim: \"'Twas brillig, and the Binglenotche did gyre and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were the borogroves, and the mome raths outgrabe.\" There are at least 2 repeated content words/phrases (\"Binglenotche\", \"mimsy\", \"borogroves\", \"mome raths\", \"outgrabe\"), so clear ring composition with repeated content words and a refrain of sorts. Yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>The poem includes an admonition line: “Beware the Tinsmith, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! Beware the Stake-Bird, and shun the frumious Bandersnatch!” which parallels the original warning. So yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>The protagonist \"took his vorpal sword in hand; long time the manxome foe he sought— so rested he by the Tumtum tree, and stood awhile in thought.\" This is preparation before fight: a tool, waiting, or resolve. So yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>There is a clear encounter line in stanza 4: \"And, as in uffish thought he stood, the Tinsmith, with eyes of flame, came whiffling through the tulgey wood, and burbled as it came!\" This is the confrontation. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>The decisive action is present at stanza 5: \"One, two! One, two! And through and through the vorpal blade went snicker-snack! He left it dead, and with its head he went galumphing back.\" Clear decisive slaying. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>The return and celebration stanza is stanza 6: \"‘And hast thou slain the Tinsmith? Come to my arms, my beamish boy! O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!’ He chortled in his joy.\" Jubilant return present. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Counting distinct coinages outside canonical list: Binglenotch/Binglenotche (one root), borogroves (like borogoves but different), Stake-Bird, Stake-Song, Song (not coined but capitalized), Tinsmith (not canonical), borogroves (variant), and possibly fratious variations. Overall only few new coinages: Binglenotch, borogroves (close to borogoves but modified), Stake-Bird, Stake-Song. Possibly less than 8 distinct invented coinages, given the heavy canonical lexicon reuse. No clear evidence of ≥8 distinct new coinages. So no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinages are largely concentrated in opening and closing stanzas. Middle stanzas mostly contain canonical words or no coinage. So not every stanza contains at least 1 coinage. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>The poem names a non-canonical creature central to action: \"Tinsmith\" is clearly a creature/entity distinct from canonical Jabberwock. It is the adversary. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia like \"snicker-snack!\" appears once; other onomatopoeic bursts like \"clang\" appear only at the end but used as a noun, not necessarily as onomatopoeic bursts in the same sense. \"Shriek, hum, clang\" in last stanza is somewhat onomatopoeic. Altogether there are at least two onomatopoeic bursts (\"snicker-snack\" and \"shriek\"). Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats in at least 2 stanzas: “Binglenotch's Baffy,” “frumious Bandersnatch,” “vorpal blade,” “beamish boy,” “shriek, hum, clang,” some internal repetition but moderate evidence of clear alliteration/consonance in lines? Mostly standard Carroll alliteration but not strong in new material. Slight but possibly insufficient evidence for clear within-line alliteration in two stanzas beyond incidental. So no.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration in this order is clearly present: admonition stanza first, then preparation, then encounter, then decisive action, then return stanza. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Many lines are verbatim from the canonical poem (e.g., stanza 1 lines are almost exactly the same except Binglenotch changes; also nearly verbatim the last stanza, the battle stanza, return stanza). So some lines exactly match canonical, which disqualifies this. So no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens reused are brillig, slithy/tinsmith substitution, toves/borogroves variant, mome raths, outgrabe, vorpal, manxome, Tumtum, uffish, whiffling, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish, frabjous, Callooh! Callay!, chortled, joy, bandesnatch, jabberwock subbed for tinsmith. Overall many canonical tokens reused, exceeding 8. Negative for canonical budget. No.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Longer lines mostly 8-9 syllables, shorter lines about 5-7 syllables, but run-on lines disrupt meter clarity. Some stanzas approximate Jabberwocky’s meter, but others have line break irregularities and run-ons. No definite consistent syllable tightness. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety is low due to heavy reuse of \"wabe\"/\"outgrabe,\" \"Bandersnatch,\" and \"catch.\" So some end rhymes are repeated over multiple stanzas > 2 times. No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition outside ring echo: many canonical tokens reused multiple times (e.g., \"Binglenotch\", \"Tinsmith\", \"borogroves\" twice), but no single content word is heavily overused (>5 or >8%). The canonical poem is repeated a lot, but other than that, no content word overused excessively. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages have at least Binglenotch, borogroves, Stake-Bird, Stake-Song. But two or three mostly derivations of the same root \"Stake\" and \"Binglenotch\" is one root. So not ≥4 distinct roots; dominance of \"Stake-\" suffix may exceed 50%. So no.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>The poem addresses the topic of a Jabberwocky style poem, with a similar story of a creature called the \"Tinsmith\" slayed by protagonist. Topic adherence yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>The poem does not present a clear implied subtext or coherent motif/undertone beyond surface action. Seems straightforward retelling with minor substitutions, no detectable deeper subtext. No.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.5416666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 0.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 0.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 0.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 0.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 1.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.5416666666666666, "criteria_yes": 13, "label": "low"}

thus, topic is consistent with Jabberwocky style and narrative (not substituting unrelated topic).</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Poem preserves motif of a dangerous creature and a youth’s coming-of-age quest with undertones of caution, bravery, and triumph, showing a coherent implied layer.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.9166666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 0.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.9166666666666666, "criteria_yes": 22, "label": "high"}
