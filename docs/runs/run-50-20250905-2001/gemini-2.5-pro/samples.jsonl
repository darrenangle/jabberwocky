Beware the Skreemle-bird, and shun its call,” clearly an early warning. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: The guard-man flentching his \"vorpal flag\" might be a preparation action, but it is brief and not clearly a preparation or planning by the protagonist who is addressed indirectly. No clear protagonist preparation apparent before encounter. No.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: No clear direct encounter/confrontation with the named adversaries Rail-wyrm or Skreemle-bird; these are referred to but no meeting or direct confrontation is recorded. No.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: No decisive action resolving tension such as defeating or overcoming an adversary; \"The guard-man flentched his vorpal flag\" is not a slaying act, and no other decisive battle act present.

No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: Coined words include glockentime, slothy, wibber, mimsy (canonical), huffing clouds (huffing is English); grabe, Rail-wyrm, Skreemle-bird, flentched, vorpal (canonical), chuffering, joyance, gallow-lamp. Counting only non-canonical, possibly ~8 distinct coined words (glockentime, slothy, wibber, grabe, Rail-wyrm, Skreemle, flentched, chuffering, joyance, gallow-lamp). At least 8 distinct coined words. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage distribution: Every stanza contains at least one coinage word: stanza 1 (glockentime, slothy, wibber), stanza 2 (grabe, Rail-wyrm, Skreemle), stanza 3 (flentched, vorpal), stanza 4 (glumptious, chuffering, joyance), stanza 5 repeats stanza 1. Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creatures: Rail-wyrm and Skreemle-bird are new named creatures/entities central to action. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Some phrases like \"clunk-clinch\" in stanza 3 represent onomatopoeic bursts; any others? No other clear onomatopoeic bursts (like 'snicker-snack'). Only one strong onomatopoeic word: no ≥2 confirmed. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Some alliteration in stanza 1 (\"slothy crowds,\" \"wibber,\" \"gallow-lamp\"), and stanza 4 (\"glumptious, empty plain\"; \"chuffering rain\"); but likely less than 2 stanzas showing clear strong alliteration beyond incidental repeats.

Stanza 2 lines: about 9,9,9,9 syllables (less alternation). Not always tight, but mostly near pattern. Because ≥60% not clearly met due to stanza 2, 3 lines mostly equal length, answer no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: End rhymes (2,4) change stanza by stanza: damp/lamp; plight/call (partial slant); slots/spots; vast/over-past; repeated stanza 1 at end. No exact end word reused >2 times except repeated stanza. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No content word overused; words like \"beware\" appear twice appropriately; no single overuse.

At least 4 distinct roots with no suffix dominating. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem addresses a journey departure at a platform with railway creatures named, paralleling Jabberwocky battle motif, so topic adherence to Jabberwocky is clear.

Examples: alticrag, frigor-thin, grike, scarpstone-kin, rime-grawls, Ghasting, Skreeskite, chuntering, glumptious, grapple-stave, cridgy, altilone, fliffled, vyridesque, galumphed, hymn-scrit, flay-vane. Over 8 distinct invented words. -> yes</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Does each stanza contain at least one coinage? Stanza 1 (alticrag, frigor-thin, grike, scarpstone-kin, rime-grawls), stanza 2 (Ghasting, Skreeskite, chuntering, glumptious), stanza 3 (grapple-stave, cridgy, tumtum, uffish), stanza 4 (Ghasting, shneer, altilone, fliffled), stanza 5 (hymn-scrit, flay-vanes, vyridesque, galumphed), stanza 6 (frabjous, Callooh, Callay chortled), stanza 7 no; stanza 8 repeats stanza 1. Stanza 7 is 3 lines, not 4, but checking stanza 7: “And has he seen the flay-vane fly? Oh, frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! He chortled in his joy.” Some ambiguity as stanza 7 is quatrain?, lines from copied poem have 3 lines in stanza 6 and 7 combined; model appears to have 8 stanzas total, last two stanzas different line count? On close look stanza 7 has 4 lines: “And has he seen the flay-vane fly? / Oh, frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! / He chortled in his joy. / ” actually 3 lines only? Toward poem end stanza 7 is 3 lines, so not all 8 stanzas are quatrains. Hence stanza 7 fails coinage presence and quatrain shape. -> no</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central to action? Ghasting and Skreeskite appear as adversaries, with Ghasting being the central enemy addressed and encountered. -> yes</C13_think>\n<C14_think>At least 2 onomatopoeic bursts? Words like “whiffling” and “burbled” in original appear here as “whiffling”, “fliffled” (invented, but onomatopoeic-like). No clear other onomatopoeic bursts like “snicker-snack” or “Pop!” Two onomatopoeic bursts: “whiffling” and “fliffled”. -> yes</C14_think>\n<C15_think>At least 2 stanzas with clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repetition? Examples: stanza 2 “chuntering, glumptious”, stanza 1 “frigor-thin... Did gyre and grike” shows consonance. Overall multiple stanzas show alliteration/consonance. -> yes</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order in canonical sequence? Warning (stanza 2), preparation (3), encounter (4), decisive action (5), return/celebration (6). Stanza 7 is celebratory continuation; final stanza ring. No major order violations. -> yes</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Any line exactly matches canonical poem? Normalizing whitespace/dashes/punctuation. The model poem uses “’Twas alticrag...” not “’Twas brillig...”, “grike” instead of “gimble”, “scarpstone-kin” etc. Some canonical words directly used: “Did gyre”, “All mimsy”, “And the mome raths outgrabe.” This line: “And the mome raths outgrabe.” is exactly from the canonical poem. This is a verbatim line. -> no</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Number distinct canonical tokens ≤8? Canonical words used: gyre, uffish, mimsy, tumtum, galumphed (variation of galumphing), frabjous, Callooh, Callay, chortled in his joy (common phrase in Jabberwocky). While canonical presence moderate, total distinct tokens probably ≤8; the model uses quite a few new words. -> yes</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness roughly 8-9 syll longer lines, 5-7 shorter lines in every quatrain stanza? Example stanza 1: line 1 “’Twas alticrag, and the frigor-thin” (8 syll) line 2 “Did gyre and grike in the air;” (6 syll), line 3 “All mimsy were the scarpstone-kin,” (8 syll), line 4 “And the rime-grawls did despair.” (6 syll). Pattern consistent with Jabberwocky. Good syllable control throughout. -> yes</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: no end word reused >2 times excluding echo? Words like “air”, “despair”, “way”, “flay”, “sought”, “thought”, “shneer”, “drear”, “sun”, “run” generally not exactly repeated over twice except echo stanza repeats some. Rhyme variety adequate. -> yes</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No overuse of single content word >5 times or >8%? Coinages and content quite varied; no obvious overuse. -> yes</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: ≥4 distinct roots? Coinages have many distinct roots (alticrag, frigor, grike, scarpstone, rime, Ghasting, Skreeskite, chuntering, glumptious, grapple, cridgy, altilone, fliffled, vyridesque, galumphed, hymn-scrit, flay-vane). Roots clearly diverse, no suffix dominates. -> yes</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence? The poem clearly parallels Jabberwocky with a named adversary (Ghasting), warning, encounter, slaying or battle, and return. Topic faithful to original style and subject (monster hunt poem). -> yes</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied layer? The poem carries a coherent undertone of an adventurous hunt and overcoming fear, similar to the original’s motif.

Sample: st1 line 1 \"’Twas brumous, and the slorpy skerrigs\" (8 syllables), line 2 shorter? “Did scroam and frillick by the sea;” (7 syllables). Pattern consistent across stanzas. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety in (2,4) line rhymes: Several rhymes differ stanza by stanza (sea/free, sear/death (slant), sought/fought, ire/core (slant), fell/hiss (no rhyme), dread/joy(no rhyme), joy/gale no rhyme), maximum reuse 2 times or fewer excluding ring echo. Variety is met. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No obvious content word repetition above 5 times or 8% outside ring echo. “Flaymorge” repeated often but this is creature name; not considered overuse in guard.
