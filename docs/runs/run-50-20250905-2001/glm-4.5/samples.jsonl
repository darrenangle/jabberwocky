All are mostly quatrains, but the 1st stanza includes 5 lines combined awkwardly; however, after splitting carefully, the stanzas otherwise seem to have 4 lines each. The total stanza count is 8, which is within 5-8; but the first stanza's lines are merged incorrectly, so not all stanzas properly have 4 lines.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter with alternating longer/shorter lines: The poem generally follows Jabberwocky’s meter, alternating roughly 8-9 and 5-7 syllables, so likely ≥60% stanzas meet this pattern.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (2,4) in ≥60% stanzas with no AABB dominance: Rhyme matches Jabberwocky style well except some adaptations (e.g., screed/wabe, catch/scratch, thought/flame, came/snack/back, joy/day). Rhyme varies; no obvious AABB dominance; mostly second and fourth lines rhyme. So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza repeats the first stanza’s opening line structure and shares \"Twas brillig, and the slithy chars Did gyre and gimble in the screed; All mimsy were the borogoves,\" and ends with cedar box held seed instead of mome raths outgrabe. So there's a clear refrain/echo with ≥2 repeated content words -> yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition: Present in second stanza with \"Beware the Cedarling, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! Beware the Scribbledex, and shun The frumious Ink-witch's scratch!\" clearly an admonition like original.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: He took his Vorpal Pen in hand; long time foe he sought—so rested by Tumtum tree and stood in thought.

Counting carefully distinct invented coinages: chars, Cedarling, Scribbledex, Ink-witch, screed. That is 5 distinct new coinages. Below 8.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains ≥1 coinage? Last stanza has \"cedar box\" but that is English, rest contain canonical or coined words; some stanzas lack obvious coinage—e.g. \"he took his Vorpal Pen,\" \"manxome foe,\" mostly canonical or standard English. So less than all stanzas have coinages.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named and central, not canonical or Jabberwock: The \"Cedarling\" is the named creature repeatedly referenced and is the adversary.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"snicker-snack\" and \"burbled\" appear; \"snicker-snack\" is canonical onomatopoeia, \"burbled\" is canonical but can be considered onomatopoeic.

However, the phrase \"Beware the ... The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!\" is identical in wording to the first poem's second stanza lines except creature names swapped. The line \"He left it dead, and with its head He went galumphing back.\" is verbatim from canonical poem. Therefore, verbatim lines exist -> no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget ≤8 distinct canonical tokens: Canonical terms used are brillig, slithy, gyre, gimble, wabe (replaced), mimsy, borogoves, manxome, Tumtum, uffish, whiffling, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish, frabjous, Callooh, Callay, chortled vs chuckled (changed). Probably ≤8 distinct canonical tokens excluding common words. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines mostly around 8-9 syllables (e.g., \"Twas brillig, and the slithy chars\" = 8; \"Did gyre and gimble in the screed\"=8), shorter lines 5-7 syllables. Pattern approximately matched.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The end rhymes vary: screed/wabe (changed), catch/scratch, sought/thought, flame/came, snicker-snack/back, boy/joy, day/Callay, seed/outgrabe (changed). No end rhyme reused >2 times excluding ring echo, so yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overused excessively; \"Cedarling\" repeated but only about 5 times in 8 stanzas, likely below thresholds.

Final stanza does not echo first stanza clearly, no content words repeated in the same way. No repeated refrains. So no.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present? No admonition or caution is present in poem text. It's a description of rain on roof with no warning. So no.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament before encounter? The poem does not have a protagonist preparing for encounter; rather it describes rain falling in stages, no tool or resolve or waiting.

Counting canonical words is not included; need 8 distinct invented coinages. Here: Split-Grade, Enlarger-Beast, Snork-Snorch, Dodging-Tool, grymbled = 5. Not enough for 8. So no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Not every stanza contains at least one coinage. For example, stanza 2 repeats manxome, Tumtum, canonical; stanza 6 mostly canonical words; the admonition stanza contains coinages; thus about 5 of 6 stanzas contain at least one invented coinage. So no (requires every stanza).</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: The 'Split-Grade' is a named and central adversary—noncanonical creature/entity name and central to action. Enlarger-Beast and Snork-Snorch mentioned but Split-Grade is main. So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"snicker-snack\" present (canonical). No other clear onomatopoeic bursts noted. Only one onomatopoeic burst is present. Requirement is ≥2. So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in at least 2 stanzas: Examples like \"snicker-snack\", \"frumious Snork-Snorch’s batch\" show consonance/alliteration in at least 2 stanzas. So yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning → preparation → encounter → decisive → return appears in canonical order in poem. So yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines from canonical poem: Lines here closely mimic canonical poem but do not exactly match—e.g. \"He took his Dodging-Tool in hand\" vs canonical \"He took his vorpal sword in hand\"; use of \"One, two! One, two!\" lines are canonical but repeated with different coinages. Strictly, any exact match invalidates, so \"One, two! One, two!\" identical is verbatim line from canonical. So no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token count ≤8 and favor new coinages: poem contains manxome, Tumtum, uffish, whiffling, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish (8 canonical tokens used). So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines ≈8–9 syllables, shorter lines ≈5–7 syllables checked (e.g. \"He took his Dodging-Tool in hand\" = 7 syll; \"Long time the manxome foe he sought—\" = 8 syll). Most lines conform reasonably. So yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhymes like catch/batch, sought/thought, flame/came, snicker-snack/back, boy/Callay appear with no exact end word reused excessively (max reuse ≤2). So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No single content word overused excessively. Aside from canonical repeated words, no overuse detected. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages appear from multiple distinct roots: Split-Grade, Enlarger-Beast, Snork-Snorch, Dodging-Tool, grymbled. Only one coined suffix predominates? No single suffix >50%. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly addresses \"Split-Grade\" encounter, evidently paralleling Jabberwocky story, maintaining the topic style and narrative consistent with original poem subject. So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Subtext beyond surface present? The poem seems to maintain the moral-style \"beware, prepare, slay, celebrate\" motif per Jabberwocky. There is implied undertone about challenge and overcoming, symbolic despair or trials. So yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.8333333333333334, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 0.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.8333333333333334, "criteria_yes": 20, "label": "high"}
