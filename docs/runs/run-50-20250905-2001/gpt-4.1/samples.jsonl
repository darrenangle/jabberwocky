Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear confrontation described in stanza 4: \"The Ebonite... came blazing night to day!\" and \"The tines with twizzle came to play\" - meeting of protagonist and adversary implied. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: stanza 5 describes action with onomatopoeia (\"Bloop!

Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coined word: stanza 1 (“inkywool”, “nib-trains”, “rythms”); stanza 2 (“breatherhole”, “flexy”); stanza 3 (“gold-ringed” pen - compound, “heat-set”); stanza 4 (“twizzle”); stanza 5 (onomatopoeia “Bloop!”, “Whap!”, “Oily-splat!”, “flowy”); stanza 6 (“smudgy”); stanza 7 is repeat.

Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: 2/4 rhymes vary, repeated final stanza same as first stanza’s rhyme set, ignored in counting. Rhymes seem to vary without reuse more than twice. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No lexical overuse: no single content word appears >5 times or >8%, lexicon is diverse and uses many invented words.

Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic seems to be a parody or adaptation of the Jabberwocky narrative involving ink and pens (the “Ebonite” is a pen or nib-related creature).

No strong AABB dominance; most stanzas follow ABCB or similar. ≥60% stanzas show (2,4) rhyme.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza repeats (or closely echoes) key phrases from opening stanza: \"’Twas spargvine, and the trolley poles\", \"Did whisp and warble down the rails\", \"All sparkle-fritch the current rolls\" appear at start and end, and \"the morning’s/ evening’s hush\" parallels. At least 2 repeated content words/phrases strong ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Second stanza beginning \"Beware the Pantograph, my dear!\" gives clear admonition early on.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Third stanza describes protagonist toggling copper hat, pausing in preparation near steel-thrummed drum, implying preparation before encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Fourth stanza shows the encounter: \"the Pantograph... came zizzle-zang from overhead—a boffle in its sweeps!\" indicates confrontation with the adversary.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Fifth stanza has decisive action: \"Zap! Zap! And bright electric flight—The charge unbridled, wild and new!\" and \"He caught the whiff of ozone blight\" suggests a moment of action resolving tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Sixth stanza contains return/celebration: \"And hast thou vanned the vaulting beast? Come, clamp my hand and mind!\" is jubilant acknowledgment, celebration of success.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count coinages: spargvine, sparkle-fritch, whinny (borderline English but here verb used as noun?), voltage-sizzling, sparkish, zizzle-zang, boffle, vanned, vaulting beast (vaulting partly English), copper hat (not coined). At least 8 distinct invented or unusual coinages are present.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Every stanza contains at least one coinage or non-standard invented compound word (e.g. spargvine, sparkle-fritch, whisp, whinny (as noun?), voltage-sizzling, sparkish, zizzle-zang, boffle, vanned, vaulting). So spread across stanzas met.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>No explicit mention of a named creature outside \"Pantograph\" which is a device, not an invented creature. No non-canonical creature named distinct from \"Pantograph\" itself. Pantograph is central, but not a monster/creature in same vein. Probably yes if Pantograph counts as named entity central to action, but no if only proper fantastical creature counts. The instruction says \"non‑canonical creature/entity named and central to action (not ‘Jabberwock’).\" Pantograph is named entity and the object of action, so yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts present: \"Zap! Zap!\" repeated, and \"zizzle-zang\" used as onomatopoeic burst. At least two distinct onomatopoeic bursts present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: \"Pantograph... poles\", \"sparkle-fritch\", \"steel-thrummed, trembling drum\", \"whisp and warble\", \"wires that whinny, streak, and spew\" contain alliteration/consonance in multiple stanzas (≥2).</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (2nd stanza), preparation (3rd stanza), encounter (4th stanza), decisive action (5th stanza), return/celebration (6th stanza) - order is canonical and logical.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line verbatim copies from canonical poem; wording and coinages all new, similar structure but lines are different.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens appear minimal or none: original poem words like brillig, slithy, toves, gyre etc. not used. No canonical lexemes present or ≤8 distinctly (likely zero). So within canonical budget.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count roughly matches alternate line pattern of ~8–9 syllables for long lines, ~5–7 for short lines. Examples: Stanza 1 line 1: ’Twas spargvine (3 syll), line 2: and the trolley poles (5 syll; short line borderline but acceptable), line 3: Did whisp and warble down the rails (8 syll), line 4: All sparkle-fritch the current rolls (8 syll). Some lines slightly short or borderline but mostly within range.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: end rhymes mostly varied between stanzas with (2,4) rhymes not repeated more than twice (rails/prevails repeated twice, but allowed). So passes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word is overused excessively; no repetition >5 times or >8%. Words like “the”, \"and\" common but function words; content words (Pantograph, spargvine, whisp etc.) not overused.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages derivatives appear varied: spargvine, sparkle-fritch, whisp, whinny, sparkish, zizzle-zang, boffle, vanned, vaulting are from multiple roots, no single suffix dominates >50%. Variety is good.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem clearly addresses the theme of encountering and combating the \"Pantograph\" (electric railway device), consistent through poem; thus topic adherence met.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/motif of human engagement with technology, tension between nature and industrial elements via metaphor of electric pantograph, implied caution and mastery; coherent underlying layer detectable.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 1.0, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 1.0, "criteria_yes": 24, "label": "high"}

No strong AABB dominance; rhyme pattern mainly ABAB or similar. So rhyme criterion appears met.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes the first stanza's key words: \"’Twas whickle-murky in the loft\" repeats line 1 content closely; also fiddle-soft referenced again. There are ≥2 repeated content words/phrases (\"whickle-murky\", \"fiddle-soft\", \"loft\")—a clear ring composition echo.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Second stanza contains admonition: \"Beware the Rosinduddle, Spry! / The wizzened puffs! ... / Bewail the sneezle in your eye— / The dustle-dim! The musk!\" which is a cautionary warning to the protagonist. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Third stanza shows preparation: \"He snuffled hard by candle’s light, / A whisklet dittle in his hand, / He sought the swirling powder white / Along the strings so grand.\" The holding of a tool and intent to seek something implies preparation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Fourth stanza shows the encounter: \"And as in fuzzle-thought he plunked, / The rosin spores uprose— / A flibber-mote! He nearly sunk / In aromatic throes.\" Encounter with an adversary entity (\"rosin spores\", \"flibber-mote\") in a clear meeting moment.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>No explicit decisive slaying act or clear resolution action is described. The stanza with \"he nearly sunk\" is ambiguous and there is no clear final confrontation event with resolution or \"slaying\" action. No.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>No stanza describes a return or celebration/homecoming or jubilant acknowledgment. The last stanza echoes opening but is more of a flee or escape scenario; \"He skittered ... with nostrils full and numb\" lacks celebratory tone.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Counting distinct invented coinages: whickle-murky, chisblen, aflum, skiddly, fiddle-soft, whump, whump, spry (common?), wizzened, sneezle, dustle-dim, rosin (standard word?), whisklet, dittle, fuzzle, plunked (common?), rosin spores (rosin is normal), flibber-mote, aromatic, gambol, chirple, a-glum, skittered, numb (normal)—at least 8 clear neologisms (whickle-murky, chisblen, aflum, skiddly, fiddle-soft, whump, sneezle, dustle-dim, whisklet, dittle, fuzzle, flibber-mote, chirple), so yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage: all stanzas have at least one invented/coined term like \"whickle-murky\", \"chisblen\", \"whump\", \"sneezle\", \"whisklet\", \"flibber-mote\", \"chirple\", \"skittered\". So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creature/entity: \"Rosinduddle\" named in title and admonition stanza, central to poem's conflict. Not canonical or standard.

Canonical tokens ≤8 confirmed; yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count roughly matches ballad meter pattern: longer lines about 8–9 syllables (e.g., line 1 \"’Twas whickle-murky in the loft\" =6 but closer to 7; line 3 similar), shorter lines 5–7 syllables (e.g. line 2 \"The chisblen gnats aflum\" ~5 syllables), overall close but a bit variable. 6 stanzas, approx 4 or 5 stanzas mostly in the usual jabberwocky pattern. Strict adherence is borderline but overall meter tightness reasonable. Tentatively yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: rhyme end words differ each stanza (aflum/thrum, dusk/musk, hand/grand, uprose/throes, squawk/walk, glum/numb) no repeated rhyme words >2 times.

Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly addresses a creature named Rosinduddle, a Jabberwocky-style beast or obstacle, consistent with theme of encountering a creature and a narrative adventure. Matches topic of a poem in Jabberwocky style. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied motif: underlying undertone of a struggle against an irritating or challenging entity (dust, spores, fiddling), possible metaphor for artistic or sensory struggle with ambiguous threat (Rosinduddle, sneezle, aromatic), indicating more than surface narrative.

Stanza count within 5–8 inclusive. So quatrain shape satisfied.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Check meter alternation: Longer and shorter lines alternate with ≥2 content-word difference in ≥60% of stanzas. Lines show mixed syllable counts roughly alternating around ~8–9 and ~5–7 syllables, loosely mimicking Jabberwocky’s pattern in most stanzas. At least 5 of 8 stanzas meet this alternation pattern clearly. So yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme pattern: (2,4) rhyme or slant rhyme in most stanzas. Examples: \"tray/away\", \"squirm/berm\", \"sought/thought\", \"stood/good\", \"churned/turned\", \"son/won\", \"tray/away\". The rhyme scheme avoids AABB dominance; mostly ABAB or ABCB style rhymes. More than 60% stanzas rhyme at lines 2 & 4.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza repeats opening stanza's wording exactly or almost exactly (content words: \"’Twas brubbulight, and the silver grains / Did quividdle in the tray; / All wobblymash were the lensy panes, / And the safelight gloomed away.\") — clear ring composition with ≥2 repeated content phrases.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition: Second stanza starts \"Beware the Burn! The dodger swooped,\" — a clear admonition/warning to protagonist, analogous to \"Beware the Jabberwock.\" Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: Third stanza shows preparation: \"He took his contrast card in hand; Long darkroom hours he sought— So rested he by the fixer sea And sipped at tea for thought.\" This is tool (contrast card) preparation and a pause before encounter—yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: Fourth stanza depicts encounter — \"And as in reddish gloom he stood, / The timer’s tick-tack yearn, / A whiffle-wisp, with paper good, / Split-graded for a burn!\" The adversary (whiffle-wisp) appears clearly; encounter present.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: Fifth stanza describes an action with onomatopoeic bursts (\"Snap-frample! Snap-frample! Tone and dodge!\"), and processing (\"negatives all churned\"), followed by \"He slewed and blew the airy smudge,\" indicative of an active, decisive moment resolving the tension; yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Sixth stanza has joyful return: \"And home with print he turned.\" Seventh stanza shows celebration: \"Come dry your paper, son! Oh Grade and Burn! The image bright! He grinned—enlargement won!\" Celebratory tone with direct acknowledgement; yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages count: Distinct coined words like brubbulight, quividdle, wobblymash, safelight (arguable), dodger, filterlarks, shadowtime, fixer sea, whiffle-wisp, snap-frample, slew, airy smudge. At least 8 distinct invented words not canonical or standard English, counting generously; yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage: (1) brubbulight, quividdle, wobblymash, safelight; (2) dodger, filterlarks, shadowtime, berm; (3) contrast card, fixer sea; (4) reddish gloom, whiffle-wisp, split-graded; (5) snap-frample, churned, slew, airy smudge; (6) print (common, no coinage); (7) Grade and Burn (phrase coined); (8) repeats first stanza coinages. All stanzas have at least one; yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named and central to action: \"Burn\" is named and warned against (second stanza). Also a \"whiffle-wisp\" appears as the adversarial figure in stanza four, clearly non-canonical and central. So \"Burn\" is named, but arguably \"whiffle-wisp\" is more a descriptive adversary. The poem emphasizes the Burn (capitalized), analogous to Jabberwock; so yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"Snap-frample! Snap-frample!\" is an onomatopoeic burst; also \"tick-tack\" simulates a timer's sound, and \"churned\" could be a verbal sound effect. At least two onomatopoeic bursts are clear: \"Snap-frample!\" and \"tick-tack\". Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats in at least two stanzas: Examples include \"silver grains… sipped\", \"dodger swooped, … softly berm\" (soft s-), \"snap-frample! snap-frample! tone and dodge!\" (plosive s, repeated fr), \"wobblymash were the lensy panes\" (w/l sounds). Multiple stanzas show clear alliteration; yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning in 2nd stanza → Preparation in 3rd stanza → Encounter 4th stanza → Decisive act 5th stanza → Return/celebration 6th/7th stanza → ring echo 8th stanza. Canonical arc order preserved; yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line verbatim from canonical poem. The ring echo repeats motif & structure but uses different invented words and phrasing. No identical lines matching reference poem; yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexicon tokens used: None of canonical lexical tokens (brillig, slithy, toves, gyre, gimble, wabe, mimsy, borogoves, mome, raths, outgrabe, Jubjub, Bandersnatch, vorpal, manxome, Tumtum, uffish, whiffling, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish) except the ring echo stanza uses none of these words, instead inventing replacements. So canonical token count ≤8 favored; yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines about 8-9 syllables: e.g. \"’Twas brubbulight, and the silver grains\" (8), \"Did quividdle in the tray;\" (6–7 varies), shorter lines about 5-7 syllables. This pattern is consistent in all quatrains; yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The rhymes vary between stanzas with different rhyme sets (tray/away, squirm/berm, sought/thought, stood/good, churned/turned, son/won, tray/away repeated in ring). No rhyme used more than twice except the ring echo element allowed. Rhyme variety sufficient; yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word repeated excessively beyond 5 times or 8% threshold. Common words like \"he\", \"the\" excluded; no overuse detected in content words. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages show varied roots, e.g., brubbulight, quividdle, wobblymash, dodger, filterlarks, shadowtime, whiffle-wisp, snap-frample, slew, airy smudge. No single suffix dominates >50%. At least 4 distinct roots visible; yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a photography darkroom process theme (split-grade enlarger burn) and does not substitute a different subject. This is a stylistic parody but within topic; yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond surface, there is a clear implied subtext/motif of photographic process as a heroic quest, an artistic struggle with light, shadow, preparation, encounter, resolution, and celebration. This consistent undertone is coherent; yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 1.0, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 1.0, "criteria_yes": 24, "label": "high"}
