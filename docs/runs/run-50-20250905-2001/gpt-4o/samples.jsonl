Also, all stanzas are mostly quatrains but the title line as separate might affect count. The poem stanzas mostly have 4 lines, but the last stanza has 4 lines, so all stanzas are quatrains, but total number exceeds 8 (9 stanzas). This fails the total stanza count condition.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Line syllable lengths: looking at stanza 1, lines alternate longer/shorter distinctly (e.g. \"’Twas brillig in the moonlit grove,\" (~8 syll) and \"The forge did clang with fiery wail;\" (~7 syll) — possibly borderline; check majority stanzas: 7/9 stanzas show good alternation of longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content-word difference. This criterion appears met.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme: several stanzas show (2,4) rhyme like grove/wail (slant rhyme?), child/told (slant), hand/oak (no rhyme), stood/glee (no rhyme), weave/cleave (rhyme), grace/entwined (no), Callay/day (rhyme), morn/deep (no). Rhyme (2,4) is present but less than 60% of stanzas (maybe 4–5 stanzas); also no strong avoidance of AABB dominance is needed since most stanzas use ABCB or slant rhyme. Approx 50–55% stanzas with rhymed lines (2,4) - borderline but not ≥60%. So no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza does not clearly echo the opening stanza with ≥2 repeated phrases or a clear refrain. There is no ring composition; no direct repetition of words/phrases from the first stanza or refrain.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Second stanza contains an early admonition: \"Beware the Scroll of Leaf, my child,\" - clear warning present.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Third stanza: protagonist prepares, taking a pen, drawing lines, sitting under the oak - clear preparation before the encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Fourth stanza indicates an encounter with the Scroll of Leaf unfurling, singing aloud - clear meeting between protagonist and entity.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>The decisive action is ambiguous; tracing the scroll and “casting spells” might count, but no violent/slaying act is presented. The tension is resolved by artistic interaction rather than conflict. Slightly weak but present as the protagonist completes the spellwork.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Seventh stanza: \"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\" and joyous celebration present. The last stanza indicates the scroll returning home and peace settling, so return and celebration are clearly depicted.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Distinct invented coinages: \"Scroll of Leaf\" (compound?), \"frabjous,\" \"Callooh! Callay,\" \"zephyr's grace,\" \"verdant hue,\" \"leafy trance,\" \"forged leaf scroll,\" \"leafy gold\" (some compounds/common English but poetic). Counting purely neologisms or neologistic compounds: borderline fewer than 8 distinct non-canonical coined terms; no evident strong coinages like Carroll's poem. No canonical Carroll coinages used except \"frabjous,\" \"Callooh! Callay\" (canonical from Jabberwocky). So coinage count ≥8 is no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Not all stanzas have invented coinages; early stanzas and middle stanzas mostly have common English terms or slightly poetic phrases; no invented words in many stanzas. Fails the requirement of every stanza having at least one coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>The named creature/entity is \"Scroll of Leaf\"; non-canonical, central to action, not “Jabberwock” - this is satisfied.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: none found like \"snicker-snack\" or \"burbled\"; no clear imitative sound bursts or exclamations besides the celebratory \"Callooh! Callay!\" which are interjections but not onomatopoeia. Onomatopoeia count is insufficient (0 or 1, counting only celebration words which are not strict onomatopoeia). No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration or consonance: some alliteration, e.g. \"forge did clang with fiery wail,\" \"whispered secrets did unveil,\" \"spirals danced they in the air,\" but only one or two stanzas show clear alliteration. Requirement is ≥2 stanzas with clear alliteration beyond incidental. Here, only two stanzas have reasonably clear alliteration, so yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza 2) → preparation (3) → encounter (4) → decisive (5-6, artistic action) → return/celebration (7-9). This roughly follows canonical order. So yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line exactly matches any line from the reference poem; wording and structure are original; \"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\" is canonical phrase from original poem but not entire line verbatim from original. Lines are not identical to any in canon. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens usage: \"’Twas,\" \"brillig,\" \"Beware,\" \"vorpal\" absent; only \"frabjous,\" \"Callooh,\" \"Callay\" appear from canon. This totals only three canonical tokens used, which is less than or equal to 8, favoring new language. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts: Longer lines mostly 8–9 syllables; shorter lines 5–7 syllables in stanzas; the meter resembles Jabberwocky with few exceptions. All quatrains fit approximate 8/6 syllable pattern; yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: rhymes (2,4) are often different across stanzas or slant rhymes, no reuse of (2,4) rhymes more than twice; rhyme variety is moderate. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No word appears overly repeated (none exceeds 5 times or 8% of content words); lexical repetition is controlled. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages come from different roots/concepts related to nature and magic - \"leaf,\" \"scroll,\" \"zephyr,\" \"spell,\" \"forest,\" \"frabjous,\" \"Callooh/Callay\" - considered about 4 or more distinct roots, so yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem addresses \"Scroll of Leaf\" topic clearly; no substitution or shift in topic away from the named magical scroll with forest-magic context. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: forest magic, knowledge, the power of written stories, transformation themes run through poem.

So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: The poem uses no obvious canonical tokens other than \"Beware\", \"The\", \"And\", \"He\", \"Come\", \"to\", which is under 8 tokens; most lexicon is new coinages.

And through and through / The doughy foes advanced now. / He bonded fleet, his spirits neat, / And filled the hearth's great vow.\" This shows action and resolution rather than a direct slaying but the \"bonded fleet\" and fulfilling vow suggest decisive act resolving conflict.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration is expressed with \"And hast thou slain the Levain dread? / Now crimp and crown, my Bakehouse Boy! / Oh double crumb, delicious crumb!\" and \"frolic home in joy.\" Indicates jubilant homecoming/acknowledgement.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Unique invented coinages include—briny, floury, burnished (standard English, so not counted), sourdough coves, yeasty scents (yeasty standard but scents normal), Levain, autolyse, doughy blade, grainy strand, bubbly crave, billed, oaf, warble, doughy foes, bonded fleet, great vow, Bakehouse Boy, double crumb, frolic (standard). Coinages: Levain, autolyse, doughy blade, grainy strand, bubbly crave, billed, oaf, warble (some may be borderline English but mostly common words). Count is borderline but fewer than 8 distinct clear coinages; \"Levain\" and \"autolyse\" are technical baking terms not from English vernacular and are invented for poetic context. Probably around 3-5 distinct coinages, fewer than 8.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Every stanza contains at least one coinage or nonce word (e.g., \"Levain\", \"autolyse\", \"doughy blade\", \"grainy strand\", \"bubbly crave\", \"warble\"). So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: \"Levain\" is a baking term but here functions as a named adversary \"The bubbling beast,\" fulfilling the creature naming criterion, though not a fantastic creature like the canonical poem. It is nonstandard for poem but may be borderline as it is a real baking term.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: None clearly present. No splat/pop/hiss/snicker-snack or similar bursts. Words like \"bubble\" or \"warble\" are not onomatopoeic bursts here, so no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Examples like \"floury loaves\", \"bubbly beast\", \"billed and cooed with oaf\", \"bonded fleet, his spirits neat\" but relatively mild. At least two stanzas show some alliteration or consonance beyond incidental. So yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order appears canonical: warning (stanza 2) → preparation (stanza 3) → encounter (stanza 4) → decisive act (stanza 5) → return/celebration (stanza 6). The rest (stanzas 1 and 7) are atmospheric/ring echo. Meets criterion.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line exactly matches any line from Carroll’s original poem. The poem uses similar structure but none are verbatim or identical in normalized form.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used are limited: \"’Twas\", \"and\", \"the\", \"in\", \"he\", \"my\", \"of\", \"a\", \"with\". Coinages dominate new words. Possibly fewer than or about 8 canonical tokens used overall; meets criterion.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Lines show reasonable syllable counts approximating ~8–9 syllables for longer lines and 5–7 for shorter lines, mostly similar to Jabberwocky meter. Majority of stanzas show good syllable tightness.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The rhyme words vary across stanzas (\"bowl/extol\", \"mesh/enmeshed\", \"sought/wrought\", \"crave/brave\", \"now/vow\", \"dread/said\", \"loaves/extol\"). No end word reused >2 times except ring echo call. Rhyme variety good.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No content word is heavily overused outside the ring echo; repetition is moderate and within normal bounds.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show diverse roots: autolyse, levain, doughy, warble, crimp, crown—all from different roots with no single root dominating >50% of coined words; meets criterion.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem remains clearly about a \"Levain,\" a bread dough/beast figure, matching the \"Jabberwocky\" coinage and style parody topic; topic coherent throughout.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Implied themes include caution and courage in the baking process, creative struggle, victory, and celebration; builds a coherent thematic undertone of a heroic baking quest metaphor, consistent throughout.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.875, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.875, "criteria_yes": 21, "label": "high"}

So no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes opening with repeating lines about brillig, gyre, gimble, ultraviolet beams, and safe lights grinning grim; strong ring composition with ≥2 repeated content words.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Second stanza includes admonition \"Beware the Split-grade Burn, my dear! The curves that flash, the frames that hotch! Beware the glaring filters' sneer, And shun the darkroom's itchy notch.\" This is a clear warning early in poem.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Third stanza shows protagonist preparation: \"He took his trusty lens in hand; Long time the silvery foe he sought— So rested he on Dektol's band, And stood awhile in thought.\" This meets preparation/armament criterion.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Fourth stanza depicts an encounter: \"And as in airy poise he paused, The Split-grade Burn, with fire aflame, Came whiffling through the plasma gauze, And murmured while proclaim.\" Clear meeting with adversary.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Fifth stanza shows decisive action: \"One, two! One, two! In seconds sawn, The lensblade flew, the paper pressed! He captured it, fair contrast drawn, And stood there, ever blessed.\" Decisive act resolving tension (slaying the burn).</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Sixth stanza shows return and celebration: \"And hast thou slain the Burn too bright? Come to my zone, my optic boy! O Renderous day! Darkroom delight!” He chortled in his joy.\" Return and jubilant acknowledgement.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Invented coinages include: splinter-bright, enphoto, burn, split-grade, hotch, plasma gauze, lensblade, renderous, optic boy (some may be borderline standard English or compound phrases, but at least 8 distinct invented or uncommon coinages appear).</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one invented word or coinage: \"brillig,\" \"ultraviolet,\" \"split-grade,\" \"hotch,\" \"plasma gauze,\" \"lensblade,\" \"renderous,\" \"optic boy,\" \"darkroom's itchy notch,\" so coinages spread through all stanzas.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named is \"Split-grade Burn\" - a non-canonical adversary to protagonist, central to poem’s action.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"whiffling\" (canonical) is present; \"One, two! One, two!\" somewhat onomatopoeic as battle rhythm, but no clear second distinct onomatopoeic bursts like \"snicker-snack\" etc. Only one clear onomatopoeic burst (whiffling). So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance present in at least two stanzas, e.g., stanza 1: \"safe lights were grinning grim,\" stanza 2: \"glaring filters' sneer,\" stanza 3: \"silvery foe.\" Evidence of deliberate consonance/alliteration beyond incidental repeats.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order present as warning (stanza 2), preparation (stanza 3), encounter (stanza 4), decisive action (stanza 5), return/celebration (stanza 6), all in canonical sequence.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Lines do not verbatim match canonical poem; some lines have canonical coinages but phrasing is original and no exact line is repeated.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used: brillig, gyre, gimble, whiffling, burbled (no burbled here), beamish (no), vorpal(no), Jubjub(no), Bandersnatch(no), manxome(no), Tumtum(no), slithy(no), mimsy(no), borogoves(no), mome(no), raths(no), outgrabe(no). Only brillig, gyre, gimble, whiffling used, four canonical tokens <8, so budget met.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Lines show approximate syllabic pattern close to Jabberwocky’s longer lines ≈8–9 syllables and shorter lines ≈5–7 syllables in every stanza; checked carefully, syllable counts acceptable for this criterion.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety limited as fewer than 60% stanzas have (2,4) rhyme; rhyme pairs not frequently repeated anyway; no overuse of any rhyme word beyond 2 times excluding ring echo.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No clearly overused content word outside the ring echo; no single content word exceeding 5 times or 8% of total content words.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Invented coinages exhibit varied roots: split-grade, enphoto, lensblade, renderous, plasma, hotch; suffixes and roots diverse, no overdominant suffix accounting >50% of coinages.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-themed topic centered on photographic darkroom \"Split-grade Burn,\" so on-topic and aligned with original’s theme of a fearsome adversary encountered and conquered.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext of photographic process, struggle with \"burn,\" a metaphorical battle in creative process, underlines the poem; coherent implied layer detectable throughout.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.9166666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.9166666666666666, "criteria_yes": 22, "label": "high"}

Actually stanza 7 is the ring echo repeated; corresponds to stanza 1/8).
