Yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter implies alternating longer/shorter lines per stanza with ≥2 content-word length difference in ≥60% stanzas. Examining line lengths roughly: lines mostly similar in length, often nearly equal syllables (~7–9), no clear alternating short/long pattern with notable content-word difference in majority of stanzas. No.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Check rhyme of lines 2 and 4 in ≥60% stanzas. Rhymes: hoor / cure (stanza1), lure / cure (2), skure / cure (3), skirr / bans (4 no rhyme of 2 and 4), demur / cure (5), loss / cure (6 no rhyme), blur / cure (7), insure / cure (8). Majority rhyming 2 and 4, but dominant rhyme is “-ure” sound mostly repeated; no avoidance of AABB dominance since most are ABCB with repeated cure. So rhyme 2,4 dominant and repeated many times; pattern is mostly ABCB but rhyme words reused multiple times. The “avoid AABB dominance” is met because scheme is mostly ABCB, but rhyme variety is low (repetition of -ure). Since the criterion focuses on rhyme pattern, yes, but the next criterion covers rhyme variety in detail.

This is the adversary/obstacle met. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: The Hurry-Scour \"Unwhirred, unwhuffed, grew wan and blur; It shrank behind the shadow-green\" indicates it was defeated or dispersed. Decisive action is implied.

The poem does not mention Jabberwock or related canonical creatures, so based on the prompt “matches the style of Jabberwocky” (not topic of Jabberwocky exactly), it is acceptable.
