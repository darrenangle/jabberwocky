Each stanza has at least 1 coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>The named creature \"blaxen frod\" is non-canonical and is central to the action as the adversary.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"whiffle-wraiths\" could be onomatopoeic but doubtful; \"roar\", \"rick-rattling roar\", \"whirring, whistling limb\" suggest some sound words but no clear word-bursts like “snicker-snack” or \"Pop!\"—not quite two clear onomatopoeic bursts in the style of Jabberwocky.

Samples suggest ~8-9 syllables in longer lines and ~6-7 in shorter lines; fairly tight.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme words on 2,4 lines vary across stanzas without exact end-word reuse over twice, except the title phrase \"Beware the frod\" echoed only twice (one in warning, one in last stanza), acceptable.

So no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>There are 4 stanzas; examining line lengths and content word differences does not give a clear ballad meter pattern (alternating longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content word difference) in at least 60% of stanzas. The line lengths seem roughly uniform; no clear alternating long-short pattern.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme pattern is partly evident: stanza 1 lines 2 and 4 rhyme (\"tone\", \"inlay\") no (slant?) but \"inlay\" doesn't rhyme with \"tone\"; stanza 2 lines 2 and 4 (\"snarl\" / \"braid\") no rhyme; stanza 3 lines 2 and 4 (\"bight\" / \"night\") rhyme; stanza 4 lines 2 and 4 (\"glee\" / \"thee\") rhyme. So 2 out of 4 stanzas rhyme 2,4 lines (50%) which is less than the 60% threshold, and AABB dominance is minimal here since rhyme is not consistent; so no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>No clear ring composition or echoing of the first stanza in the final stanza with at least 2 repeated content words or clear refrain. The final stanza uses some words like \"pietra dura\" seen earlier but not clear echo of the opening stanza content words as a refrain.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>There is an admonition in stanza 2: \"Beware the weft-chime, my son! ... Beware ... and shun...\", matching the criterion for early warning/admonition.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>There is preparation by the protagonist: \"He took his glint-blade in hand, and trekked through the marrow-moss ...\", so yes, preparation before confrontation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>The poem does not depict a clear encounter or confrontation between protagonist and adversary. There's mention of vanquishing under \"crust-flint's gleaming band\" but no explicit meeting or confrontation scene detailed; it's too vague.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action is only hinted vaguely (\"He vanquished 'neath the crust-flint’s gleaming band\"), but not clearly described or detailed as a decisive moment resolving tension, so borderline but no.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>There is no return or celebration stanza as per the Jabberwocky arc; last stanza is calm but no jubilant acknowledgment or triumphant return.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>The poem has several distinct invented coinages: glint-molded, marbless, slither-spoil, whorfs, chitter-crackled, pietra dura inlay (though pietra dura is a real term, but here in a poetic coinage context), weft-chime, rime-brittle, whorple, husk-bloom, glint-blade, marrow-moss, crust-flint, ripple-gloom, shiver-spirit, stone-silks, crackle-vein, scent-of-gem. Counting distinct coined words is ≥8 for sure.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage: st1 has glint-molded, marbless, slither-spoil, chitter-crackled, pietra dura inlay; st2: weft-chime, rime-brittle, whorple; st3: glint-blade, marrow-moss, crust-flint, ripple-gloom, shiver-spirit; st4: stone-silks, crackle-vein, scent-of-gem. So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>No named non-canonical creature or entity that is central to action. There is \"weft-chime\" and \"husk-bloom\" as possible entities, but they read more as objects or phenomena than named creatures. No explicit adversary named as a creature/entity unlike the Jabberwock etc.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeic bursts like \"snicker-snack\", \"burbled\", \"hiss\" are absent. The poem does have words like \"chitter-crackled\" and \"crackle-vein\" which are somewhat suggestive, but no ≥2 clear onomatopoeic bursts or exclamations are present. So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance is present in some lines: e.g., \"glint-molded\", \"marbless stone\", \"slither-spoil\", \"fluted fissure’s tone\"; \"crust-flint’s gleaming band\"; \"ripple-gloom\", \"shiver-spirit\". At least 2 stanzas have this stylistic device clearly.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order recognition: admonition (stanza 2) → preparation (3) → vague vanquishing/decisive act (3) → no clear encounter (missing or vague), no clear return/celebration (4). Arc is incomplete and partially out of order because encounter is not explicit before decisive act, and no return. So no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>None of the lines exactly match canonical lines from the Jabberwocky after normalization. All lines are newly constructed. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens reused: \"’Twas brillig\", some canonical words appear such as \"brillig\", and perhaps some fragments like \"Beware\". Total distinct canonical tokens is ≤8 (brillig, beware), favoring coinages. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts roughly per line in first stanza: line 1 (’Twas brillig, glint-molded, and the marbless stone,) ~11 syllables (too long); line 2 ~9 syllables; line 3 ~8 syllables; line 4 ~7 syllables. No clear alternating pattern of long (8-9)/short (5-7) is sustained in ≥60% stanzas. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme words for lines 2 and 4 vary somewhat, but rhyme in first 2 stanzas is weak/nonexistent. Only last 2 stanzas show rhyme, which differs 2X and 2X. No repeated exact rhyme more than twice. So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word is overused >5 times or >8%; coinages dominate lexical field, and \"brillig\" repeated twice only. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show many distinct roots: glint, mold, marbless, slither, spoil, whorf, chitter, crackle, pietra dura, weft, chime, rime, brittle, whorple, husk, bloom, glade, blade, marrow, moss, crust, flint, ripple, gloom, shiver, spirit, stone, silks, scent, gem. The suffix \"-ed\" or \"-ly\" or \"-less\" is varied; no single suffix dominates more than 50%. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>The poem centers around a crafted stone inlay as opponent/adversary but substitutes the original Jabberwocky theme with a somewhat different subject (decorative stone). The poem keeps the form and invokes caution, battle, and action, but the topic is changed substantially. So no.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>There is a motif of precious stone, craftsmanship, peril, and overcoming. This can be read as metaphor for artistic creation or struggle, showing some coherent implied layer beyond surface action. So yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>no</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.5, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 0.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 1.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.5, "criteria_yes": 12, "label": "low"}

So <60% no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme in (2,4)?  \nStanza 1: glade / shade (perfect rhyme) - rhyme present  \nStanza 2: spring / wing (perfect rhyme) - rhyme present  \nStanza 3: hand / land (perfect rhyme) - rhyme present  \nSo 3/3 stanzas rhyme in lines 2 & 4.  \nAre the rhymes varied and non-AABB dominant? All stanzas have ABAB style so no AABB dominance, so yes rhyme pattern consistent and not AABB dominant.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Does the final stanza echo the opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words or a clear refrain?  \nOpening stanza: balancëd, spryngy collet, gyre, gimble, glade, frabjous, crubbish pellet, mome frosts, outgrabe  \nEnding stanza: \"He took his vorpal spade in hand\", \"With a swift swipe he slayed the snarp\", \"And peace returned to spring and land\", \"Where collets sang in balancëd harp.\"  \nThere is a repeated word \"balancëd\" used both in stanza 1 and 3; \"collet\" and \"collets\" appear in 1st and last stanza; \"spring\" appears in last stanza. That is at least 2 repeated content words/phrases connecting first and last stanza.  \nSo yes, ring composition achieved.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Is there an early admonition or caution?  \nIn stanza 2: \"Beware the Jibber-snarp, my son,\" is clearly a warning to the protagonist in early stanza. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Does the protagonist prepare?  \nNo explicit preparation stanza before encounter: no tool sharpening, no waiting, no resolve stated except “He took his vorpal spade in hand” which could be preparation, but happens in stanza 3 which seems to also contain decisive action.  \nNo distinct earlier preparation phase. No.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Is there a clear confrontation or encounter?  \nThe text lacks a distinct stanza describing encounter/confrontation. The second stanza is warning, third stanza is action (slayed the snarp). The adversary \"Jibber-snarp\" mentioned in stanza 2 but no explicit meeting described. No clear encounter stanza describing meeting. No.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Is there a decisive act resolving central tension?  \nYes, stanza 3 line 2: \"With a swift swipe he slayed the snarp.\" Decisive slaying action clearly described.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Is there a return/homecoming celebration?  \nNo stanza or lines indicate protagonist returns or is celebrated after victory.  \nLast stanza has \"peace returned to spring and land\" and \"collets sang in balancëd harp\" which suggests a restored peaceful state but no explicit personal celebration or return. No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Are there ≥8 distinct invented coinages?  \nCheck: balancëd, spryngy, collet, frabjous, crubbish, pellet, mome frosts, Jibber-snarp, snarp.  \n\"balancëd\" and \"frabjous\" are either real or canonical usage, \"mome\" canonical, \"pellet\" English word.  \nCounting only invented new coinages: spryngy (invented adj.), collet (sounds like noun coined), crubbish (new), Jibber-snarp (creature), snarp (creature), frosts (not coined).  \nDistinct coinages probably about 5-6 only. Not ≥8. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Does each stanza contain ≥1 coinage?  \nStanza 1: balancëd, spryngy, collet, frabjous, crubbish, mome (canonical), pellet, outgrabe (canonical).  \nYes, stanza 1 coinages present.  \nStanza 2: Jibber-snarp, collet, balancëd (repeat), jaws snap as phrase.  \nYes.  \nStanza 3: vorpal (canonical), spade (English), snarp (coinage), balancëd, collets.  \nYes.  \nSo all 3 stanzas have ≥1 coinage. Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>A non-canonical creature/entity is named and central to action (not Jabberwock)?  \nYes, \"Jibber-snarp\" is the adversary, joker creature resembling Jabberwock but different name. No Jabberwock word used. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Are there ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts?  \nNo obvious onomatopoeia such as \"snicker-snack,\" \"burbled,\" \"hiss,\" \"pop,\" or similar words appearing anywhere. No onomatopoeia at all. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Are there ≥2 stanzas with clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental?  \nStanza 1: \"balancëd\", \"spryngy\", \"collet\", \"crubbish pellet\", \"mome frosts\", \"outgrabe\" – some consonance with 'b', 'c', 'p' sounds in \"crubbish pellet\", \"collet\"  \nStanza 2: \"jaws snap\", \"chortles with a clank of collet’s run\", \"flutters ‘midst balancëd wing\" all with alliterative consonance (clank/collet, snaps)  \nStanza 3 less clear.  \nAt least 2 stanzas have clear alliteration. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Does the poem follow canonical arc order (warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration)?  \nPoem has warning (stanza 2), then immediately decisive action (stanza 3). Lacks preparation stanza and lacks distinct encounter stanza. The order is warning then decisive slay then peace but missing preparation and encounter explicitly. So no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Any exact lines from canonical poem?  \nCheck lines vs canonical:  \n- Uses \"’Twas ... and the ... Did gyre and gimble ...\" pattern but changes words and lines; no line exactly matches canonical.  \nNo exact line copied verbatim. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Are distinct canonical tokens ≤8, favoring new coinages?  \nCanonical poem lexicon includes \"balancëd\" is not canonical, \"spryngy\" not canonical, \"collet\" not canonical, \"frabjous\" is canonical in Jabberwocky (frabjous is from English but used in Carroll’s poem?), \"mome\" canonical, \"outgrabe\" canonical, \"vorpal\" canonical, \"gyre\" canonical, \"gimble\" canonical, \"snarp\" new, \"Jibber-snarp\" new.\n\nCanonical words used: gyre, gimble, mome, outgrabe, vorpal = 5  \nNot more than 8 used. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Does syllable count per stanza roughly match Jabberwocky pattern (long lines ~8-9 syllables, short lines 5-7, lines alternate)?  \nLines mostly similar length (7-8 syllables), with no clear consistent longer/shorter alternating pattern. Does not fit ballad meter well. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Are (2,4) end-rhymes varied across stanzas (no repeated >2 times excluding ring echo)?  \nRhyme pairs: glade/shade, spring/wing, hand/land = 3 distinct rhyme sets; none repeated more than twice. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Is there lexical repetition guard? No content word overused (>5 times or >8%).  \nNo obvious repeated word overused. \"balancëd\" and \"collet\" occur 3 times max in 3 stanza poem, well under limit. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Do coinages have ≥4 distinct roots, no single suffix dominates?  \nCoinages include: balancëd, spryngy, collet, crubbish, pellet, Jibber-snarp, snarp, frabjous, mome (canonical).  \nAt least 5 distinct roots, suffixes vary. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Does poem clearly address topic of Jabberwocky (a fantastical creature confrontation)?  \nYes, poem themed similarly with a creature adversary (Jibber-snarp), the warning, slaying, peace restored, similar themes. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Is there coherent underlying subtext or motif?  \nSubtext minimal: balance/ spring collet as motif suggests cyclical nature or harmony restored by slaying menace. Ambiguous but some subtle motif of balance and nature’s song restored. Acceptable coherence. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.625, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.625, "criteria_yes": 15, "label": "medium"}

No climax stanza. So no.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>No return or celebration stanza is present. Poem ends with preparation, no homecoming or joy. So no.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented coinages: glint-bright, blazeflux, frumple-spike, whorling, gleed, tarl-fluted, slither-swords, yelp-glisten, crindle-veins, nimbus-spared, blunder-boughs, quix-tweed, glimmer-frost, gnar-tucked, quaver-bright, snerk-ling, splinter-hush, velvet-glare, jabber-spear, echo-dream, rhyme-woven. More than 8 distinct coinages present, so yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage: stanza 1-2 coinages; stanza 3 admonition includes coinages; stanza 4 multiple coinages. So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central to action: \"snerk-ling\" is named as adversary. The \"gnar-tucked, quaver-bright\" phrase possibly describes it. So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>No clear onomatopoeia bursts like \"snicker-snack,\" \"pop,\" \"hiss,\" etc. Words like \"yelp-glisten\" or \"splinter-hush\" are not onomatopoeic bursts. So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: \"blazeflux gleamed,\" \"frumple-spike and whorling,\" \"tarl-fluted,\" \"slither-swords in yelp-glisten,\" \"crindle-veins,\" \"blunder-boughs,\" \"gnar-tucked, quaver-bright,\" \"jabber-spear,\" \"rhyme-woven.\" At least two stanzas contain clear within-line alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats. So yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning in stanza 3 occurs third; preparation in stanza 4 last; no clear encounter (missing), no decisive act or return. Thus arc beats are incomplete and not fully in canonical order. So no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines match from reference poem. All lines invented with new words, so yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Count canonical tokens used: only \"Beware\" appears canonical (common English), no direct canonical coinages used such as \"brillig,\" \"slithy,\" \"toves,\" etc. Canonical tokens ≤8, so yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count and tightness in quatrains: lines vary in length; typical Jabberwocky ballad alternates ~8-9 syllables and 5-7 syllables. This poem's lines mostly are approximately 8-9 syllables each or more, not alternating clearly with 5–7 syllables. Thus no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhyme (2,4) overall poor, with no repeated end-words more than twice (due to minimal rhyme, no repetition). However, rhyme quantity fails, so this criterion is no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No excessive lexical repetition; no evident content word overused beyond limits. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages have multiple distinct roots and suffixes (glint, blaze, frumple, whorl, tarl, slither, yelp, crindle, nimbus, blunder, quix, glimmer, gnar, quaver, snerk, splinter, velvet, jabber, echo, rhyme). Many different roots; no single suffix dominates >50%. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The model poem invents a similar kind of nonsensical fantasy creature and narrative with themes of warning and heroic preparation, resembling the Jabberwocky’s theme. Topic is evidently preserved, so yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem implies a motif of combating a mysterious shimmering threat and dawn emerging from rhythm/poetry, which suggests an undertone about facing fears and bringing light/order. A coherent implied layer is detectable, so yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.5416666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 1.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.5416666666666666, "criteria_yes": 13, "label": "low"}

Some reuse of similar rhyme sounds but exact end words appear 1-2 times only. No overuse >2 times excludes ring echo reuse.

So fails total stanza count requirement.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Checking alternation of line length per stanza for ≥60%: \n-Stanza 1 lines: 8,7,8,7 syllables approx (long-short alternation mostly holds).\n-Stanza 2 lines: mostly 8 or 7 syllables, but alternation pattern not strongly showing ≥2 content-word difference clearly in ≥60% stanzas. Only 1-2 stanzas showing alternation.\nOverall, less than 60% stanzas have clear alternating longer/shorter lines.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme of lines 2 and 4 checked stanza-wise:\n-Stanza 1: \"fey\" / \"spray\" rhyme clearly.\n-Stanza 2: \"sway\" / \"day\" rhyme clearly.\n-Stanza 3: \"hue\" / \"anew\" rhyme clearly.\n-Stanza 4: \"bright\" / \"right\" rhyme clearly.\nAll stanzas have (2,4) rhyme, no evident AABB dominance as no (1,2) or (3,4)-dominant rhyme scheme.\nHence passing rhyme pattern criterion.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza repeats general theme but no ≥2 content words from opening stanza or clear refrain. No ring composition or exact repeated lines.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>There is an admonition starting stanza 2: \"Beware the blorple‑skulked, that blinks\". This serves as a warning to the protagonist, so yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation by protagonist: \"He snatched the snerk-filled, trembling rhymes\" suggests action but no clear preparation/planning/arming or waiting before encounter. No clear preparation stanza or line.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: stanza 2 describes the adversary's traits but no clear meeting. Stanza 3 shows the protagonist fleeing and chanting, but no clear direct encounter described. Adversary presence is implied but no direct confrontation.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>No decisive slaying or triumph action shown. The scribe flees and chants anew, but no clear resolution or killing of adversary.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>No return or joyous celebration described; last stanza is more contemplative/hushed rather than celebratory.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Distinct invented words: snarl-bright, quill-torn, kiridashi, blorple-skulked, waffling, jab-sprocket, snerk-filled, blith-blasted, flim-flam. At least 9 distinct coinages found (waffling is standard English possibly, but most are coinages). So yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage:\n1) snarl-bright, quill-torn, kiridashi\n2) blorple-skulked, jab-sprocket\n3) snerk-filled, blith-blasted, flim-flam\n4) None obvious coinage except \"kiridashi\" repeated, \"scribbled nonsense\" no coinage word. Last stanza may lack coinage, so fail.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Kiridashi Scribe is named as an entity central to the poem's action; \"blorple-skulked\" creatures mentioned but no named creature distinct enough. Kiridashi is the protagonist, an entity, but not a creature. No non-canonical creature clearly named and central aside from protagonist.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: none like \"snicker-snack\", \"burbled\", \"hiss\" are visible. No bursting or popping sounds or onomatopoeic bursts detected. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration and consonance check:\n- Stanza 1 has repeated 's' sounds in “snarl-bright,” “scribble,” “spray.”\n- Stanza 2 “blorple-skulked,” “waffling whisk-tails.” Clear alliteration.\n- Two stanzas show clear alliteration beyond incidental repeats, yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order judged: Warning present (stanza 2), but preparation (stanza 3) is ambiguous, more fleeing and chanting than planning; encounter not explicit; decisive action absent; return/celebration absent.\nArc does not appear fully or clearly in canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines exactly match canonical poem (checking first lines and repeated lines). All lines appear original. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens presence: \"Did gyre\" and maybe \"And the\" - canonical words \"gyre\" appears once, \"Did\" common. Only \"Did gyre\" from canonical lexicon is reused, fewer than 8 distinct canonical tokens used, so budget accepted.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Line syllable counts roughly conform to Jabberwocky pattern (long lines ~8-9 syllables, short lines ~6 syllables). Most stanzas show this syllable pattern consistently even if not perfectly strict, so yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme endings vary stanzas: fey/spray, sway/day, hue/anew, bright/right. All different rhymes; no reuse >2 times, so yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No overuse or repetition of any single content word beyond normal; words appear varied. No word >5 times or >8% of content tokens. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages appear varied with different roots: snarl-, quill-, kiridashi, blorple-, jab-, snerk-, blith-, flim- all seem distinct. No single suffix dominates >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem addresses a creature-themed nonsense poem about a \"kiridashi scribe\" and an adversary \"blorple-skulked\" creature. The abstract topic about a whimsical creature and its slaying or encounter fits Jabberwocky style without changing topic. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: some implied poetic motifs of creative struggle (scribe vs. creature stealing verses), a motif of artistic endurance, a mythical battle of words. This gives a coherent subtext beyond surface nonsense. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.5416666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 1.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.5416666666666666, "criteria_yes": 13, "label": "low"}
