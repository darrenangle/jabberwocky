Strictly 'coinages' are about unique nonce words or analogues to Carroll’s style—spoolig, reelish, snicker-snick, wow (creative use), warp (slightly nounified), flutter (common word but renamed creature). Counting at least 8 distinct creative nonce or transformed coinages is borderline but likely met if counting 'spoolig,' 'reelish,' 'wow,' 'snicker-snick,' 'warp,' 'flutter' (as creature), 'wobbly choir' (phrase), and possibly 'playback sword' metaphorically.

No, many stanzas lack coinages beyond canonical terms; e.g. “den,” “chairlegs’ creaks,” “old shelves,” “soft divan,” “timbers,” “furniture”—mostly normal English.
