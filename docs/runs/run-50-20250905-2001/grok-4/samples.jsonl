Counting distinct invented coinages newly coined excluding canonical tokens: \"Urushiwock\", \"saply\", \"barkabees\", \"lacquerbird\", \"toxish\", \"hardenings\", \"resin\" (used as adjective?), possibly \"outplayed\" is an English word. At least 6–7 distinct new coinages, fewer than 8. So borderline but below 8 distinct invented coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Every stanza contains at least one coinage or invented word: stanza 1 \"saply\", \"barkabees\"; stanza 2 \"Urushiwock\", \"lacquerbird\", \"hardenings\"; stanza 3 \"varnish blade\", \"toxish\"; stanza 4 \"uffish thought\", \"Urushiwock\", \"whiffling\", \"tulgey\"; 5 \"snicker-snack\"; 6 \"Urushiwock\", \"beamish\"; 7 ring echo repeats coinages.

So yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: The poem has close parallels but no exact line matches from canonical poem; some lines are very close or identical in syntax but wording differs enough (\"’Twas humid\" vs. \"’Twas brillig\", \"saply trees\" vs. \"slithy toves\"). So no exact canonical line appears verbatim. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used: \"frumious\", \"snicker-snack\", \"galumphing\", \"beamish\", \"ufish\", \"tulgey\", \"tumtum\", \"whiffling\" all canonical except that \"frumious\" and \"tumtum\" appear, \"whiffling\", \"tulgey\", \"snicker-snack\", \"beamish\" present. Count is close to 8 or at 8. So canonical budget <=8 is met.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness similar to original with longer lines around 8–9 syllables and shorter around 6 syllables is roughly maintained in all quatrains.

Because there are multiple lines exactly matching the canonical poem ignoring minor changes, the criterion is not met.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Number of distinct canonical tokens used is at most 8: manxome, vorpal, tumtum, uffish, whiffling, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish, frumious (canonical lexicon is 23 words, but only a few used). So canonical budget is ≤8 tokens (slight excess: the poem uses 9 canonical tokens—frumious, manxome, tumtum, uffish, etc.—but probably within budget or very close). Since the instruction is ≤8, and this poem uses about 9 distinct canonical tokens (flagwock replaces jabberwock), so borderline. Due to strictness, answer no (since it uses manxome, vorpal, tumtum, uffish, whiffling, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish, frumious = 10 canonical tokens). So canonical budget exceeded.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count approximates Jabberwocky’s ~8–9 syllables for longer lines and ~5–7 for shorter lines in all stanzas (e.g., \"’Twas summit, and the prayer flags bright\" = 8 syllables; shorter lines 6–7 syllables).

However, \"digraph,\" \"waveform,\" \"phosphor,\" and \"Lissajous\" are English words/scientific terms, not invented coinages or nonsense words.
