The initial 8 stanzas mostly match canonical, then 8 additional stanzas follow. So total stanza count is 16 > 8, failing the stanza count limit.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter alternation: Majority of lines have an 8 and 6 syllable alternation in the canonical stanzas, but the later stanzas especially have disrupted meter; the alternation in ≥60% stanzas is not clearly sustained because of new quatrains with irregular syllable counts and no clear longer/shorter evident pattern. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme: In first 8 stanzas, rhyme scheme (2,4) mostly preserved from canonical; later stanzas have frequent slant or imperfect rhymes with some variation, no strict AABB dominance, but total stanza count is 16 which is beyond allowed max. At least 60% have (2,4) rhyme and not AABB dominant. Yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The poem reproduces the canonical first stanza as 1st and 9th stanza, and similar closing stanza repeated, which is a strong ring echo. Numerous repeated content words from opening stanza.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition: The canonical warning stanza with \"Beware the Jabberwock\" is reproduced exactly early (2nd stanza). Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: The canonical preparation stanza with \"He took his vorpal sword in hand\" included at stanza 4. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: The Jabberwock’s arrival stanza included (5th stanza). Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying decisive action: The fight and slaying stanza (6th stanza) is also reproduced. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: The jubilation stanza (7th stanza) and repeated in closing reflective stanza (8th stanza) both present. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: The poem reuses canonical coinages extensively but adds new coinages (prayer-flagy, flaggerflimsy, flaggerfraught, flaggist, cliffling, snicker-snucks, burble-vice, flumpled, jubjub-clad, summit-wocky, prayer-flagoe) adding many distinct coined terms exceeding 8 distinct new coinages total.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: New coinages are mostly concentrated in later stanzas; however the initial canonical stanzas mostly only use canonical coinages, so not every stanza contains at least 1 new coinage, but the criterion requires coinages, not necessarily invented new ones, so counting canonical coinages as coinages, all stanzas contain at least one coined word. Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: Jabberwock (canonical) is named and central. No new creature/entity is named apart from canonical Jabberwock or Jubjub, Bandersnatch. The poem uses \"summit-wocky\" and \"prayer-flagoe\" but these are more places/things, not clear creature or entity central to action. No.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: The canonical onomatopoeic bursts \"snicker-snack\" and \"burbled\" are present in original stanzas and repeated later; no additional onomatopoeic bursts detected. Two or more onomatopoeic bursts present. Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: In multiple stanzas, especially later ones with flaggerflimsy, flumpled glee, and canonical ones (e.g., \"slithy toves\"), there is clear alliteration. At least two stanzas with noticeable alliteration. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The canonical arc (warning > preparation > encounter > decisive action > return/celebration) is present and in order within the first 8 stanzas. Later stanzas are epilogue style, more thematic, so arc is preserved in main narrative. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim lines: The poem repeats exactly the canonical lines of the original poem, including the entire opening stanza, the warning stanza, preparation, encounter, fight, and jubilation stanzas verbatim. Hence verbatim canonical lines occur. No.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token budget: The poem contains many canonical tokens repeated verbatim in first 8 stanzas, exceeding the allowed max of 8 distinct canonical tokens. No.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: For canonical stanzas, syllable pattern is roughly 8/6 alternating. The later stanzas have irregular syllables, often longer lines well above 9 syllables or uneven. Criterion requires every quatrain stanza to have 8–9 and 5–7 syllables respectively; poem fails due to inconsistencies in later stanzas. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The rhyme word pairs in later stanzas show variety, and the canonical stanzas do so as well. No exact end word reused more than twice except for ring echo lines, so yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: The poem repeats canonical content words from original repeatedly but no single word appears over 5 times besides canonical repeated refrains. Within non-ring echo stanzas, no single content word overused excessively. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: New coinages come from multiple roots and suffixes (flaggerflimsy, flaggerfraught, flaggist, snicker-snucks, flumpled, prayer-flagoe, summit-wocky), showing clear variety with no suffix >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem is explicitly a Jabberwocky style poem, continuing the canonical subject and action, sometimes adding thematic elements (summit, prayer flags) but not shifting main subject. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond narrative, the additional stanzas about prayer flags, summit, and whispers suggest undertone about journey, meditative or spiritual themes, giving a detectable subtext - yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.75, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 0.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.75, "criteria_yes": 18, "label": "medium"}

Using fewer or equal to 8 canonical tokens? Tokens like vorpal, manxome, uffish, tumtum, whiffling, burbled, beamish, snicker-snack, galumphing, callooh, callay, chortled (some canonical).

The title line is not stanza text. All 8 stanzas have 4 lines each, total stanza count between 5 and 8 (inclusive).</C2_think>\n<C3_think>The meter alternates line length (long/short) in original Jabberwocky about 8/6 syllables. Here many lines are very close to original, some copied. Checking lines: mostly close 8-9 syllables and 5-7 syllables alternating. ≥60% stanzas show the alternating longer/shorter pattern with a ≥2 content word difference, though some lines are verbatim or near-verbatim from original.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme pattern is (2,4) within stanzas mostly following original: “wabe/outgrabe”, “son/catch”, “hand/thought”, etc. The model poem keeps rhyme mostly in 2nd and 4th lines, avoiding AABB dominance; slant rhymes accepted. ≥60% stanzas satisfy (2,4) rhyme.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza repeats the first stanza exactly except for “tocks” replacing “toves” and other minor changes, so at least 2 repeated content words (“brillig”, “wabe”, “borogoves”, “mome raths outgrabe”) appear providing a clear ring composition echo/refrain.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Second stanza is admonition/caution: “Beware the Colletwock, my son!”, clear early warning to protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Third stanza shows preparation: \"He took his vorpal collet sword in hand; Long time the manxsome foe he sought—So rested he by the Tumtum tree, And stood awhile in thought.\" This is clear preparation prior to encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter stanza present: \"And, as in volatile thought he stood, The Colletwock, with eyes of flame, Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,\" clear meeting between protagonist and foe.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: “One, two!

New coinages limited primarily to “Colletwock”, “Balance Springbird”, and \"manxsome\" (variant spelling). Total distinct new coinages likely fewer than 8.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Not all stanzas contain a coined word. For example, 2nd stanza has “Balance Springbird” (new coinage), 3rd “manxsome”, but in 5th stanza (encounter), all coinages appear canonical. The first stanza uses “tocks” instead of “toves” (although close). Overall, coinages are not evenly spread to all stanzas.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>New non-canonical creature is “Colletwock” and “Balance Springbird”, clearly named and central.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: “snicker-snack!” is reused (canonical). No other strong onomatopoeic bursts present besides canonical. No new onomatopoeia beyond canonical, only one clear example repeated.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration and consonance: Some alliterations in lines like “vorpal collet”, “came whiffling...”, “brillig and slithy tocks”; limited but present in multiple stanzas. At least 2 stanzas with clear alliteration beyond incidental repeats.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (\"Beware the Colletwock\"), preparation (taking vorpal sword, resting/thought), encounter (Colletwock appears), decisive action (snicker-snack, killing foe), return/celebration (joyful reunion, frabjous day), final stanza ring echo. Arc points in canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line exactly matches the canonical poem verbatim. Some lines are very close or almost identical except one word changed (\"tocks\" vs \"toves\", \"manxsome\" vs \"manxome\") or punctuation differences, but none fully verbatim. Hence passes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens typical in multiple lines, e.g. \"brillig\", \"slithy\", \"tulgey\", \"frumious\", \"vorpal\", “snicker-snack”, “beamish”, “galumphing”. Number of canonical tokens exceeds 8 distinctly used tokens (more than 8 canonical words used from the original). So this exceeds canonical budget.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Line syllable counts mostly preserve original rhythm (approx 8–9 syllables longer lines, 5–7 shorter lines). Alternation mostly consistent. Syllable tightness largely matches Jabberwocky style.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Mostly consistent; repeated end-rhyme pairs from original poem like wabe/outgrabe, son/catch, hand/thought repeated multiple times. (2,4) rhyme endings repeated but several different rhyme pairs exist across stanzas; no exact end word repeated >2 times except ring echo. So variety acceptable.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word overused excessively. “Colletwock” appears multiple times but not exceeding 5 times or 8% given the poem length. Lexical repetition guarded.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages limited mainly to “Colletwock”, “Balance Springbird”, “tocks”, and “manxsome” (spelling variant). These are about 4 distinct roots, no single root suffix accounts for >50% coinages. Variety borderline but acceptable.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>The poem clearly addresses the same topic: the Jabberwock poem with a new creature “Colletwock”. Subject clear.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem adheres closely in plot and mood to original; no new deeper implied motif or subtext beyond original action; comes off as a faithful retelling with small variants.

All stanzas are 4 lines; stanza count 5 fits between 5 and 8 inclusive; so yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>In ≥60% of stanzas (i.e. at least 3 of 5), do lines alternate longer/shorter with ≥2 content-word difference? The meter is irregular; many lines are long and uneven, some lines have uneven syllable counts but not in clear alternating pattern for majority. Less than 60% meet this; so no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme of lines (2 and 4) per stanza: stanza 1 (frumple/thrumple) rhyme; stanza 2 (snipe/gorn - no rhyme); stanza 3 (air/cling - no rhyme); stanza 4 (Fling! - no clear rhyme); stanza 5 (delight/night) rhyme at (2,4).

The first 8 stanzas are quatrains, but total stanza count is above 8 and later stanzas have uneven line counts, so rule not met.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Only first 8 stanzas show ballad meter; later stanzas are irregular. Among first 8, lines alternate length well (long-short pattern). At least 5 of first 8 stanzas meet criterion, thus 5/8 = 62.5% met initially, but overall poem includes many non-quatrains reducing total percentage. Considering whole poem, less than 60% meet meter pattern, so no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>First 8 quatrains: (2,4) lines mostly rhyme or slant rhyme; pattern resembles Carroll’s, avoiding AABB dominance. Later stanzas vary rhyme schemes and some lines do not rhyme. Counting all stanzas, under 60% have proper ballad rhyme (2,4 rhyming in quatrains). So no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza does not echo opening with repeated content words or refrain; opening stanza repeated verbatim but final stanzas are unrelated in words. The first stanza is repeated as stanza 8, but final stanza (14) is new. So no ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition is present: stanza 2 has \"Beware the Blued Screw, my son!\" matching canonical style of warning.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation evident: stanza 3 shows \"He took his vorpal sword in hand\" and \"So rested he by the Tumtum tree / And stood awhile in thought.\" Strong preparation present.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter present: stanza 4 describes Blued Screw’s appearance with \"came whiffling\" etc., representing clear confrontation.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: stanza 5 has \"One, two! One, two!\" and \"The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! / He left it dead . . .\" showing the slaying and resolution.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: stanza 6 shows jubilation with \"And hast thou slain the Blued Screw? / Come to my arms, my beamish boy! / O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\" Celebratory homecoming is clear.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Counting coinages: \"Blued Screw\" (named), new coinages like \"florple,\" \"hootchy,\" \"whiffly,\" \"vorgey,\" \"tuzzles,\" \"gimbol,\" \"ullage,\" \"ahoigh,\" and possibly more, total >8 distinct invented coinages beyond canonical lexicon.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza after stanza 7 contains new coinages, but the first 6 stanzas mostly canonical or straightforward. Early stanzas contain canonical coinages, later stanzas have novel coined words; each stanza from 9 onward includes coinages, but not all stanzas have coinages, especially first 8 which are mostly canonical. So no (not every stanza has ≥1 coinage).</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creature/entity central to action: \"Blued Screw\" is a non-canonical creature/entity named and central to the encounter and battle.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts: \"snicker-snack\" from canonical poem reused; no other obvious novel onomatopoeia bursts in new coinages; no second onomatopoeic burst is evident. So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance present in several stanzas, especially in later stanzas with coinages: \"florple flumped,\" \"gibbered through the vorgey glade,\" \"bandy hoops in motions swayed,\" \"blustering game,\" \"Jabberwocky's jamboree,\" so yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning followed by preparation, encounter, decisive action, return/celebration occurs properly in first 6 stanzas. Later stanzas deviate from arc but arc in canonical order is clearly present in the poem's core seven stanzas. So yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Exact verbatim lines from canonical poem are present multiple times (e.g., full first stanza repeated verbatim, second stanza mostly canonical lines except \"Blued Screw\" swapped for \"Jabberwock,\" lines like \"One, two! One, two! And through and through / The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!\" verbatim except foe name changed). Because any exact match of a line disallows the criteria, and entire lines match canonical poem with only creature name substituted, this is a borderline but the instructions say no if any line exactly equals canonical line. Here many lines are exactly the same (except name), so yes for exact match? The instructions indicate we normalize quotes/dashes/whitespace and if any line exactly matches reference, answer no. But with creature renaming, are lines \"exact\"? The line \"Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun\" is verbatim, so yes verbatim line exists. Therefore no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens exceed 8: The poem uses many canonical words repeatedly (brillig, slithy, toves, wabe, mimsy, borogoves, mome, raths, outgrabe, Jubjub, Bandersnatch, vorpal, manxome, Tumtum, uffish, whiffling, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish). This is well over 8 distinct canonical tokens, exceeding the canonical budget for new coinage favoring. So no.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable meter: The quatrains that match canonical poem are similarly metrically tight (8–9 syllables in longer lines, 5–7 in shorter) for most quatrains (especially first 6 stanzas). Later stanzas have looser meter with irregular line lengths. Since many non-quatrain stanzas are present, and overall syllable tightness only for early stanzas, no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Early stanzas use rhymes 2 and 4 variably; however, canonical end words are repeated excessively (e.g., repeated \"wabe,\" \"outgrabe,\" \"Bandersnatch,\" \"beamish,\" etc.); rhyme sets are reused several times. Rhyme variety is low, with repeated endings exceeding 2 uses. So no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: Many canonical content words repeated exactly as in source poem (e.g., \"the,\" \"and,\" \"in,\" \"the Blued Screw,\" \"he,\" \"with,\" all normal words). No content word is excessively overused beyond threshold relative to content words. Named creature \"Blued Screw\" is repeated, but not over 5 times or 8% of content words. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: >8 distinct coinages with multiple different roots, suffixes, and no single suffix dominates (e.g. \"florple,\" \"gibbered,\" \"hootchy,\" \"whiffly,\" \"vorgey,\" \"tuzzles,\" \"gimbol,\" \"ullage,\" \"ahoigh\"). So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem is clearly a close imitative pastiche of \"Jabberwocky,\" retelling the same narrative with a substituted creature and added new portions about \"Blued Screw\" and \"florple.\" The core subject matches and does not substitute an unrelated topic. So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem adds a motif of mechanistic \"Blued Screw\" and adversarial \"florple,\" adding a subtext of technological or rhythmic contest. The final stanzas speak of pledging \"in ullage's name\" and a jamboree, implying a celebration of invention or mechanical prowess beyond just fighting a monster. So a coherent implied undertone is detectable. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.5833333333333334, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 0.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.5833333333333334, "criteria_yes": 14, "label": "medium"}

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "### The Krenovian Plaverhoot\n\n‘Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  \nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe;  \nAll mimsy were the borogoves,  \nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.  \n\n“Beware the Krenovian Plaverhoot, my son!  \nThe jaws that bite, the claws that catch!  \nBeware the Jubjub bird, and shun  \nThe frumious Bandersnatch!”  \n\nHe took his vorpal sword in hand:  \nLong time the manxome foe he sought—  \nSo rested he by the Tumtum tree,  \nAnd stood awhile in thought.  \n\nAnd, as in uffish thought he stood,  \nThe Krenovian Plaverhoot, with eyes of flame,  \nCame whiffling through the tulgey wood,  \nAnd burbled as it came!  \n\nOne, two! One, two! And through and through  \nThe vorpal blade went snicker-snack!  \nHe left it dead, and with its head  \nHe went galumphing back.  \n\n“And, has thou slain the Krenovian Plaverhoot?  \nCome to my arms, my beamish boy!  \nO frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”  \nHe chortled in his joy.  \n\n‘Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  \nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe;  \nAll mimsy were the borogoves,  \nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.  \n\n‘I think it is the throat of the Krenovian plain,  \nAs flat as a flabbergast, yet deep in its vein;  \nIt gills with the ebb of the gibtous refrain,  \nAnd echoes the call of the crimbly remain.’  \n\nThe Krenovian plane was a throat in the night,  \nWhere horizons did chime and the moons took a fright;  \nIt swallowed the stars in a gulp full of might,  \nAnd spat out the nonsence in whimsical plight.  \n\nBeware, oh beware, of the krenish delight,  \nFor planes that are throats will devour your sight;  \nThey fruzzle and frazzle the days into night,  \nAnd leave but a riddle, abstruse and contrite.  \n\nHe ventured once more to the planar abyss,  \nWith goggles of gold and a potion of fiz;  \nBut the throat was a trickster, a swirling abyss,  \nAnd he tumbled forever in krenovian mist.  \n\n‘Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  \nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe;  \nAll mimsy were the borogoves,  \nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.  \n\nSo the boy never returned from that fathomless flight,  \nWhere the plane met the throat in eternal unite;  \nBut legends persist in the glow of the night,  \nOf the Krenovian Plaverhoot’s vorpal fight.  \n\nAnd thus ends the tale of the throat on the plane,  \nA nonsensical yarn in the Carrollian grain;  \nMay you ponder its depths, yet remain sane,  \nFor nonsense like this drives the mundane insane.  \n\nIn krenovian hues, the adventure’s replayed,  \nWith planes that are throats, ever more richly arrayed;  \nSo grab your vorpal sword, and don’t be afraid,  \nOf jabberwocky wonders, forever displayed.  \n\n‘Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  \nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe;  \nAll mimsy were the borogoves,  \nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.  \n\nThe Krenovian Plaverhoot’s throat now at rest,  \nIn the folds of the plane where the travelers quest;  \nBeware if you wander, be poetry-possessed,  \nFor Carroll’s fine folly shall haunt your bequest.  \n\nIn rhythms of jabber, the nonsense recedes,  \nYet echoes forever in whimsical deeds;  \nThe plane and the throat in harmonious needs,  \nShall dance through your dreams, planting nonsensical seeds.  \n\n‘Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  \nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe;  \nAll mimsy were the borogoves,  \nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.", "info": {}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>Title line present: \"### The Krenovian Plaverhoot\" appears before the first stanza, so yes.</C1_think>\n<C2_think>Counting stanzas: The poem has many stanzas; only the first 8 stanzas are standard quatrains, but after the initial 8 standard stanzas, there are many more stanzas with lines >4 lines or not clearly separated. The model poem contains more than 8 stanzas. Also, the poem initially copies the canonical first 8 quatrains and then continues with a lengthy addition. The total stanza count is well beyond 8, so no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>The original Jabberwocky has a ballad meter with alternating longer/shorter lines. The model’s initial stanzas mimic the original exactly, so those stanzas meet the criterion. Beyond the first stanzas, meter becomes uneven and longer lines do not clearly alternate with shorter lines in 60% of stanzas due to the extended added stanzas with varying line lengths. Overall not meeting ≥60% rule, so no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Original stanza rhymes lines 2 and 4; the first 8 stanzas are mostly identical copying or very close to canonical, so rhyme is maintained there. However, later stanzas do not maintain rhyme scheme consistently or show frequent deviations. The first 8 are apparently all rhymed 2/4, so meets >60% for initial stanzas, but the overall poem has many unrhymed stanzas after. Because total stanza count is large and many stanzas don’t match rhyme scheme, no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: multiple stanzas explicitly repeat the canonical opening stanza at start and end, also a closing stanza is repeated. This constitutes a ring composition with repeated content lines and phrases. So yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition: Present in the stanza “Beware the Krenovian Plaverhoot, my son!” matching the \"beware\" tone of the original. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: The stanza “He took his vorpal sword in hand”, “So rested he by the Tumtum tree...” implies preparation. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: “The Krenovian Plaverhoot, with eyes of flame, / Came whiffling...” clearly indicates a meeting/confrontation. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: “One, two! One, two! And through and through / The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! / He left it dead...” describes a decisive killing act. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: “He went galumphing back”, “Come to my arms, my beamish boy!”, and “He chortled in his joy.” All indicate jubilant return. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages distinct count: The poem repeats many canonical words and also coins several new words such as “Krenovian”, “Plaverhoot”, “flabbergast”, “gibtous”, “crimbly”, “fruzzle”, “frazzle”, “fathomless”, “krenish”, “jabberwocky” (though canonical is ‘jabberwock’), “nonsensical”, “Carrollian” (an adjective from author's name). Many of these are coined or nonce words, but “jabberwocky” is a known derivative, “nonsensical” and “Carrollian” are standard English or proper adjective. Around 8 or more distinct coined roots are present: krenovian, plaverhoot, flabbergast, gibtous, crimbly, fruzzle, frazzle, krenish. So yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: The initial stanzas replicate canonical lines with no new coinage beyond canonical in those stanzas; new coined words appear only after the first 8 stanzas. Since over half the poem contains new coinages, but not all stanzas have coinages, no for strict interpretation requiring each stanza to contain at least one new coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming other than Jabberwock: The “Krenovian Plaverhoot” is named repeatedly and is the central creature. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: The poem reuses canonical onomatopoeia “snicker-snack”, “whiffling”, “burbled”. However, no new onomatopoeic bursts (like Pop!, Hiss!) introduced in new stanzas. Only canonical onomatopoeia present. Need at least 2 onomatopoeic bursts, canonical or new. Since canonical bursts are present, yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: The model uses alliteration or consonance particularly in the added stanzas (e.g., “fruzzle and frazzle”, “fathomless flight”), and initial canonical stanzas have well known alliteration. At least 2 stanzas clearly demonstrate this. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc beats in canonical order: Initial stanza set follows canonical arc (warning, preparation, encounter, decisive act, return), but later stanzas introduce a different arc with extended narrative and reflections on the plane and throat, deviating from ballad arc. Overall order is preserved through initial 7-8 stanzas. The later expansion disrupts strict canonical arc but initial order is correct. Since question requires ≥60% or the poem overall to have canonical arc order clearly, the extended middle and end disrupt this, so no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim lines: The first 8 stanzas are verbatim copy of canonical poem lines, which violates the criterion. So no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget ≤8: The poem repeats many canonical lines and tokens extensively, but canonical tokens ≤8 because mostly canonical lexicon is reused. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: The first 8 stanzas match canonical pattern of ~8-9 syllables in long lines and ~6 in shorter lines. Later stanzas have varying line lengths. Since only initial stanzas qualify as quatrains, and those meet the pattern, but overall poem has many irregular lines, so no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The first 8 stanzas repeat canonical rhyme pairs multiple times at (2,4) positions. The additional stanzas are mostly free verse or with weak rhymes. The rhymes at (2,4) are repeated a lot across the poem. The same end words from canonical stanza repeats used abundantly. So no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: The poem repeats canonical repeated words (e.g., “brillig”, “slithy”, “mimsy”, repeated many times), especially in ring composition sections. However, as they are canonical and allowed repeated in echo, focus on whether any word outside ring echo is overused >5 times or >8% content words. No new excessive repetition noticed outside ring. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages like krenovian, plaverhoot, flabbergast, crimbly, gibtous, fruzzle, frazzle, krenish, etc. indicate at least 4 distinct roots. No suffix dominates >50% of coinages. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem is about a creature “Krenovian Plaverhoot” similar in narrative to Jabberwocky’s Jabberwock and addresses a nonsensical, Carrollian theme. Topic matches expected style and subject. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond surface action, the poem develops a motif about the mysterious “throat” of the “plane,” reflection on nonsensical adventure and madness vs sanity, which is a coherent implied layer consistent through the poem. So yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.6666666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 0.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.6666666666666666, "criteria_yes": 16, "label": "medium"}
