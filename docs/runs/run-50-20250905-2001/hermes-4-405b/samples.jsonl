All stanzas are quatrains and stanza count is 5 (within 5-8 range).</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Examining alternating line lengths by content words difference: \n- Stanza 1: lines vary in content words (long, shorter, long, shorter) with ≥2 difference mostly maintained.\n- Stanza 2: somewhat consistent alternating pattern with longer and shorter lines, at least 3 stanzas meet this (4 stanzas total), so ≥60% met.\n- Stanza 3: lines alternate fairly well longer/shorter pattern\n- Stanza 4: mix less clear, but roughly fits pattern.\n- Stanza 5: longer line, then shorter, but only 4 lines total so limited data.\nOverall, at least 3 out of 5 stanzas clearly display this alternation, which is 60%. So yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme per stanza (especially lines 2 and 4):\n- Stanza 1: (air, lair) rhyme, and (throngs, clang) incomplete since line 5 is a single line (so we analyze only quatrains). The stanza 1 is 5 lines, but effectively quatrain + 1. Slightly ambiguous here, but lines 2 and 4 \"air\" and \"clang\" do not rhyme; lines 2 and 4 typically analyzed per quatrains only. Needs no since stanza 1 is 5 lines.\n- Stanza 2: (lance, chance) rhyme clear.\n- Stanza 3: (clash, twain) no rhyme (clash / twain distinct). So no rhyme for stanza 3.\n- Stanza 4: (victorious, air) no rhyme.\n- Stanza 5: (us, song) no rhyme.\n\nOnly 1 of 5 stanzas have clear rhyme of lines 2 and 4. That’s only 20%, below 60% threshold. Also no evidence of avoiding AABB dominance because most are not rhymed at all. So no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza partially echoes opening phrase: \"Ebonite feed heat‑set\" appears in first and last stanza (last stanza line 3). Also both beginning and ending mention \"Ebonite feed heat‑set\", so at least two repeated content words, constituting a ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Second stanza starts with \"Beware the Gloomraug's...\" as early admonition to protagonist (just like canonical \"Beware...\"). So yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Third stanza shows protagonist seizing his \"Vorpalite lance,\" and \"long had he sought\" the Wyrm – this is preparation before encounter. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Fourth stanza shows the battle/encounter: \"One, two! One, two! … He smote that slimy fiendish goo\" – clear protagonist-adversary confrontation. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action in stanza 4: \"He smote… and sliced its heartless core in twain.\" Decisively resolving the conflict. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Fifth stanza shows return and celebration: \"By moonlight’s beam, he stood victorious\" and \"peaceful silence sings a sweeter song\" implies a triumphant return. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Invented coinages count:\n- Ebonite\n- Vorpalite (variation of vorpal but distinct coinage)\n- Gloomraug\n- Blightbird\n- Wyrm (not canonical but a known word from mythology, borderline)\n- Accurséd (archaic English, not coinage)\n- Fiendish goo (goo common English)\n- Heat‑set (compound English phrase)\nCounting clearly coined terms: ebonite, vorpalite, gloomraug, blightbird total 4 distinct new non-canonical coinages, not reaching 8 required. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Distribution of coinages per stanza:\n- Stanza 1: \"Ebonite feed heat-set\"\n- Stanza 2: \"Gloomraug\", \"Blightbird\"\n- Stanza 3: \"Vorpalite\"\n- Stanza 4: no coinages clearly seen besides \"fiendish goo\" (goo common English)\n- Stanza 5: \"Ebonite feed heat-set\"\nSo 4 of 5 stanzas have at least one coinage. Required 5/5 (≥1 in each stanza) not met. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature named and central: \"Gloomraug,\" \"Blightbird,\" and \"Wyrm\" named. Non-canonical creatures are named, but poem centers mostly on \"Wyrm\" as foe. \"Wyrm\" is an old English word for dragon-like creature, somewhat standard English usage and not a coinage, though partially archaic. Still considered named creature central to action, not \"Jabberwock\". Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia presence:\n- \"One, two! One, two!\" repeated for battle rhythm but not onomatopoeia\n- \"shriek,\" \"clang,\" \"smote\" no direct onomatopoeic bursts \nNo clear onomatopoeic interjections like snicker-snack, pop!, hiss! etc. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance checked in stanzas:\n- Stanza 1: \"Ebonite feed heat-set, through torrid air\" - repeated hard sounds, moderate alliteration on 't'.\n- Stanza 2: \"Beware the Blightbird's song\" some consonance with 'B's.\n- Stanza 3: \"He seized his trusty Vorpalite lance\" – 's' and 'l' alliteration somewhat present.\n- At least 2 stanzas show noticeable alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order:\n- Warning early (stanza 2)\n- Preparation (stanza 3)\n- Encounter (stanza 4)\n- Decisive act (stanza 4)\n- Return/celebration (stanza 5)\nSequence in canonical order. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim canonical lines check -> none identically repeated; wording and coinages very different from canonical poem. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens presence:\n- \"Beware\"\n- \"Vorpal\" (modified to Vorpalite)\n- \"One, two! One, two!\"\n- \"snicker-snack\" not present\n- \"Jabberwock\" replaced with Gloomraug/Blightbird/Wyrm\nLess than or equal to 8 distinct canonical tokens present. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts:\n- Longer lines mostly 8-9 syllables (e.g. stanza 1 line 1: \"Ebonite feed heat-set, through torrid air\" (8 syllables)\n- Shorter lines approximately 5-7 syllables: e.g. stanza 1 line 2: \"Where vapours rise, and serpentine forms throng.\" (9 syllables) a bit long\nBut overall pattern approximates Jabberwocky closely enough in all quatrains. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety in (2,4) lines minimal or lacking rhyme, thus no repeated rhyme words; technically varied but weak rhyming overall.\nRhyme variety mostly moot since most stanzas do not rhyme properly. Ambiguous, but since rhyme itself does not meet threshold, no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard:\nNo single content word overused greater than 5 times; vocabulary fairly varied; no overuse observed. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: 4 distinct coinage roots identified (Ebonite, Vorpalite, Gloomraug, Blightbird), with no one suffix dominating >50%.\nSince number of coinages is below 8, even if variety meets 4 roots, criterion fails. No.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem addresses a similar topic to Jabberwocky-style narrative of warning, battle with monster, and triumphant return based on a similar arc. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: poem has possible implicit undertone of darkness and menace (lair, jaws, fangs, battle), and triumph of hero; though less whimsical than canonical, an undertone/motif detectable.

{"i": 4, "prompt": "Write a poem in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Your prompt is \"lead type in a composing stick\". Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "\nHmm, the user wants me to write a poem in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\" with the prompt \"lead type in a composing stick.\" I need to recall what makes Carroll's poem unique. It's famous for its whimsical, nonsensical language and invented words that still evoke vivid imagery. Words like \"brillig\" and \"slithy\" have a musical, playful sound.\n\nThe prompt is about an old printing technique: lead type refers to the metal letters used in letterpress printing, and a composing stick is a tool for arranging them into words. This is a very specific, somewhat archaic theme. I should capture that in the poem while maintaining Carroll's signature silliness.\n\nThe user specified \"Output only the titled poem,\" so I must avoid any extra explanation. Just the title and poem, formatted clearly. I'll start with a title that sounds Carroll-esque, perhaps playing on \"type\" and \"stick.\"\n\nNow, brainstorming the structure: \"Jabberwocky\" has four verses with a rhythmic pattern. I'll aim for a similar flow—quatrains with a galloping meter. Key elements to include: the composing stick as a character, words like \"types\" and \"cases\" (referring to type cases), and actions like setting type. Nonsense words should feel mechanical.\n\nIn the first stanza, I'll set the scene with something like \"slithy\" but for printing—maybe \"typortly\"? Then build tension: the composing stick as a hero battling chaos. Use verbs like \"gripped\" and \"stuck\" to imply struggle.\n\nFor the climax, mirror Carroll's \"slain the Jabberwock\" with a victory over a printing foe—perhaps \"slivered the Typequaken.\" End with a return to normalcy, but hint at lingering absurdity.\n\nFinally, ensure the rhyme scheme is AABCBC, mix real and fake words, and keep it fun and mysterious. Double-check that the title fits and the poem stands alone without context.\n\n# The Typortly Typeslayer\n\nBeware the Typortly Stick, my son!\nThe jaws that grip, the slot that clings!\nBeware the Sliverlatch, and shun\nThe quillèd grave of fractured things!\n\nHe took his stick in hand, the grip\nLong lain in cases, dark and deep;\nThen stood awhile in thought, his lip\nTremblèd as he viewed the heap.\n\nAnd, as in uffish thought he stood,\nCasting his quoin with stomach-frown,\nThe Typeslake, with eyes of furious lead,\nCame blundering through the forme-case town!\n\nVorpal, vorpal! Thumped his thumb!*\nHe chortled in his glee.\nThe stick went snicker-lack! He struck!\nAnd blithely slew the Slabbèd B.\n\n\"Has thou,\" he quoth, \"my type-quenched foe?\nRejoiced my stick? Calloo! Callay!\"\n'Twas brillig, and the slithy gromes\nDanced in the chases' last dismay.\n\n*Some manuscripts suggest \"Thumped his thumb!\"; others propose \"Thumped his dumb!\" or even \"Thumped his glumb!\".

{"i": 6, "prompt": "Write a poem in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Your prompt is \"plum brown blueing bath\". Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "Архів\nAlright, the user wants a poem in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky,\" with the prompt \"plum brown blueing bath.\" Let me start by recalling the key elements of Carroll's work. He uses nonsense words, playful language, and a whimsical tone. The structure typically has four-line stanzas with a rhyme scheme of ABAB, but sometimes varies.\n\nFirst, I need to deconstruct the prompt. \"Plum brown blueing bath\" has colors and an object (bath). Maybe create a scene involving these elements. \"Plum brown\" could describe a creature or setting. \"Blueing bath\" might be a transformation or a magical element. \n\nCarroll often invents words that sound meaningful but aren't real, like \"vorpal\" or \"frabjous.\" I should coin similar terms. Words like \"slithy,\" \"gyre,\" and \"gimble\" come to mind. Also, use portmanteaus or unexpected combinations. \n\nThe poem should have a narrative, perhaps a quest or an encounter. The original \"Jabberwocky\" has a hero slaying a beast. Maybe here, the protagonist deals with a \"plum brown\" entity in a \"blueing bath.\" \n\nRhyme scheme is important. Let's aim for quatrains with alternating rhymes. The first stanza could set the scene, something like:\n\n\"Beware the plum brown blueing bath,\"  \nThe whispers wheedle through the froth;  \n\"Beware the Grume, my child, the Gorf!  \nThe jaws that gnash, the snout that snaths!\"\n\nInvented words: Grume, Gorf, snaths. These should evoke imagery. \"Grume\" might be a swampy creature, \"Gorf\" a play on \"gorge\" or \"goblin.\" \"Snaths\" as a verb for attacking.\n\nNext stanzas: Introduce the hero's actions. Use vivid, fantastical verbs. Maybe the hero takes a \"vorpal\" blade, but adapt it to the new elements. For example:\n\nHe took his spade with spune and spirth,  \nLong time the marish foe he sought—  \nThen rested by the tarn of tilleth  \nAnd stood awhile in thought.\n\n\"Spune\" and \"spirth\" as adjectives for the spade. \"Marish\" as marsh-like. \"Tarn of tilleth\" to keep the watery theme.\n\nClimax: The battle with the creature. Use dynamic verbs and sounds.\n\nOne, two! One, two! And through and through  \nThe vorpal blade went snicker-snack!  \nHe left it dead, and with its head  \nHe went galumphing back.\n\nAdapt this to the current prompt. Maybe:\n\nOne, two! One, two! And thrup and thrue  \nThe blade of lath went whisker-whack!  \nHe left it groaning, deep it sank  \nBeneath the plume of brackish black.\n\n\"Thrup\" and \"thrue\" as action sounds. \"Lath\" as a type of blade. \"Plume of brackish black\" ties back to the bath and colors.\n\nEnding:Triumphant return.

Also, maintain the whimsical, nonsensical yet evocative language throughout.\n\nDouble-check that all made-up words are consistent in style and that the poem flows cohesively from start to finish, with each stanza building on the previous one, leading to the hero's victory and the transformation of the bath.\n\n### Vermiculated Verse of the Plum-Brown Bath\n\nBeware the plum brown blueing bath,  \nWhere vapors writhe and bubbles froth;  \nBeware the Grume, the Gorf that gnashes—  \nBeware the Lurk that lathers last!  \n\nHe took his spade with spune and spirth,  \nLong time the soapy beast he sought—  \nThen crouched beside the frothèd firth  \nAnd stood awhile in murky thought.  \n\nOne, two! One, two! And through and thrue  \nThe blade of lath went whisker-whack!  \nHe left it groaning, deep it sank  \nBeneath the plume of brackish black.  \n\n\"Has thou slain the Grume? Come to my arms,  \nMy plum-mottled, foam-flecked boy!  \nO frabjous hues! The bath's aglow!\"  \nHe crooned, and capered in his joy.  \n\nTwas brillig, and the slythe toves  \nDid gyre and gimble in the suds;  \nAll mimsy were the borogoves,  \nThe bath outgrabe... as heroes bud.  \n\n(editor's note: \"grimalkin\" refers to a cat, but here may signify a creature of the bath)", "info": {"topic": "plum brown blueing bath"}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>The poem has a separate title line: \"Vermiculated Verse of the Plum-Brown Bath\" before the first stanza. Title present.</C1_think>\n<C2_think>There are 5 stanzas total, all 4 lines each. Stanza count is within 5-8. All stanzas are quatrains. Thus, yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>In 5 stanzas, lines alternate long/short with ≥2 content-word difference? Testing syllable and length pattern: Stanza 1 lines mostly 7-8 syllables per line, not a clear alternating longer/shorter pattern consistent with Jabberwocky’s ~8/6 alternating lines. Pattern is less clear and consistent. Only some stanzas show alternating longer/shorter lines markedly. Falls below 60%. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme mostly around ABAB or close variants: (bath-froth-gnashes-last), (spirth-sought-firth-thought), (thrue-whack-sank-black), (arms-boy-aglow-joy), (toves-suds-borogoves-bud). Lines 2 and 4 rhyme in all stanzas; no dominant AABB scheme. At least 3/5 stanzas meet rhyme 2 & 4 rhyming. Rhyme (2,4) consistent ≥60%. So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza partially echoes elements from the canonical poem: uses \"’Twas brillig\", \"toves\", \"gyre and gimble\", \"mimsy\", \"borogoves\", \"outgrabe\" - this is a direct call to the original and thus a ring composition echo with ≥2 content words repeated. Yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>First stanza contains an admonition: \"Beware the plum brown blueing bath,\" \"Beware the Grume\" and multiple cautions. Strong admonition early on.

Actual distinct new coinages in poem: Grume, spade with spune, spirth, thrue, lath, whisker-whack, brackish (not coinage), plum-mottled (compound), foam-flecked (compound).

Last stanza is missing the 4th line, so not all are quatrains. Total stanzas is 7 (within 5–8), but last stanza not a quatrain. Hence no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter alternation: lines alternate longer/shorter with about ≥2 content words difference in most stanzas? Meter approximation: generally resembles ballad meter with longer 8-9 syll lines and shorter 5-7 syll lines, but some lines are uneven (e.g. last stanza short lines missing). At least 4-5 stanzas have decent alternation, but not fully consistent—borderline, so no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme (2,4) rhyme: examined each stanza’s 2nd and 4th lines rhyme mostly, e.g. flutter/none other (slant rhyme weak), clutch/shun (good rhyme), sought/thought (good), flame/came (good), through/snack? No, last stanza’s incomplete rhyme is broken. Some stanzas have good rhyme but presence of AABB dominance unsure; mostly seems alternate rhyme dominant. ≥60% stanzas meet (2,4) rhyme. So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: final stanza repeats opening stanza phrases? The final stanza repeats \"’Twas summit high, and the prayer flags did flutter,\" and \"Upon the peak so steep and sharp,\" from opening. However, the last two lines are different and incomplete. ≥2 repeated content words/phrases present, enough for ring echo yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition: Present in stanza 2 with “Beware the Snowy Qizil, my son!” akin to canonical warning. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: Protagonist \"took his ice shard in hand,\" sought foe long time, rested by tree, stood in thought—definite preparation before encounter.

Less than 8, so no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Coinages appear in stanzas 1 (Qizil, Yawp), 3 (trippy?), 4 (whiffling, burbled), 5 (flack-zing), 6 (galumphing).

Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines mostly around 8-9 syllables, shorter lines mostly 5-7 syllables, but last stanza is short and incomplete. Syllables in stanzas conform reasonably except last stanza which is incomplete — partial failure means no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) end rhyme words generally unique or repeated ≤2 times; no overuse of exact rhymes.

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "\nOkay, the user wants a poem in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky,\" specifically about a luthier's soundpost setter. Let me unpack this. \n\nFirst, \"Jabberwocky\" is famous for its playful nonsense words and whimsical tone, so I need to mimic that linguistic inventiveness. The keyword here is \"luthier\" (instrument maker) and \"soundpost setter\"—that tiny but crucial dowel inside violins that transfers vibration. It's a niche, almost magical tool to outsiders.\n\nHmm, the user might be a musician or someone fascinated by craftsmanship. They're not just asking for facts—they want nonsense verse that captures the mystical mechanics of violin-making. The real challenge is balancing made-up words with enough musicality to feel authentic. \n\nI should start by creating portmanteaus that evoke workshop sounds: \"clangersnap,\" \"whiffling.\" The tool itself needs a mythical name—\"Frumious Quilkin\"—to match Carroll's creatures. The poem's arc should mirror \"Jabberwocky\": hero vs. beast, but here it's artisan vs. instrument's anatomy. \n\nUser's probably expecting rhythmic galloping lines (iambic heptameter) and a victorious climax. I'll end with the tool retiring after setting the soundpost, leaving the instrument alive. Must include Carroll-esque adjectives: \"burbling,\" \"slithy.\" \n\n...Wait, is this too obscure? No—poetry thrives in specifics. If they know \"Jabberwocky,\" they'll appreciate the craft jargon woven into nonsense. Time to brew alliterative chaos and carve it into four quatrains with a closing couplet. The title? Perhaps \"The Frumious Quilkin\" to echo \"Jabberwock.\"\n\n## The Frumious Quilkin\n\nBeware the quiv’ring clangersnap, my son!\nThe jaws that bite, the claws that chitter-clutch!\nBeware the burbling air, and shun\nThe frumious Quilkin’s soundpost touch!\n\nHe takes his vorpal pin of yew-wood bright,\nLong time the mantic tremble he subdued—\nSo rested he by the T-shaped tamarack\nAnd stood awhile in thought, besprent with rosin-spack.\n\nAnd, as in uffish thought he stood, the Quilkin,\nWith spindles whiffling through the f-holes black!\nOne, twwo!

A single flash—and so divine!\nTo see those colors in her eyes, and, too, to know that they are mine.”\nAnd in that flash, a specter pale, in love and sorrow bound,\nThe prismed crystal shattered plain—and silence filled the mound.\n\nThe sulfuretted skies above, with sapphire hues of dusk,\nDispersed like echoes on the wind, and hushed their lamentation's brusque.\nThe Fae folk gathered once again, their tears like jewels fell,\nFor in the chalc they saw themselves, and said “Farewell, farewell.”\n\nYet midst the sorrow's gloom, there gleamed an opal play-of-color flash,\nA potent symphony of hue, that filled the creviced paths.\nAnd though the prism-heart did fade, its memory beamed still,\nA beacon in the twilight world, by gemmèd mounds and rills.", "info": {"topic": "opal play‑of‑color flash"}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>Title line \"Opal Play-of-Color Flash\" present before first stanza; non-empty and separate from stanza text.</C1_think>\n<C2_think>Counting stanzas: 10 stanzas (each separated); all have roughly 4 lines except some with 5 lines (some stanzas have extra line or partial lines) - does not strictly conform to 4-line stanzas between 5 and 8 total.

No clear AABB dominance; several ABAB / ABCB patterns; passes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes first stanza with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases or refrain: Final stanza repeats \"’Twas brillig, and the slivy peonies / Did tay and gimble in the dew;\" and repeats similar words \"All flimsy were the antorhinies, / And the dawn mome lazed through.\" The opening stanza is echoed closely with repeat of many content words (\"brillig\", \"slivy peonies\", \"tay\", \"gimble\", \"dew\", \"flimsy\", \"antorhinies\", \"dawn\", \"mome\", \"lazed\"). So yes, there is a clear ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition/warning present: The second stanza has \"'Beware the Jabberwog, my son! / The jaws that bite, the teeth that scratch! / Beware the antprofrog, and shun / The frumptious Carpet-Match!'\" which is a clear warning.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Protagonist preparation/armament present: The third stanza states \"He took his vorry sword in hand; ... stood awhile in thought.\" This aligns with preparation before encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: The fourth stanza describes \"And, as in uffish thought he stood, / The Jabberwog ... Came whiffling through the trumblidge wood / And burbled as it came!\" clear meeting of protagonist and creature.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action slaying the adversary: The sixth stanza \"The vorry blade went snicker-snack! / He left it dead, and with its head / He went galumphing back.\" describes decisive action and slaying.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration present: The seventh stanza \"Has thou slain the Jabberwog? / Come to my arms, my beamish boy! / O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! / He chortled in his joy.\" expresses jubilant return.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented coinages (not canonical or standard English): Coinages include \"slivy\", \"peonies\" (though standard English word, not a coinage, might be a misuse), \"tay\", \"antorhinies\", \"antprofrog\", \"frumptious\", \"Carpet-Match\", \"vorry\", \"trumblidge\", \"onomro\". That's about 8 distinct coinages. \"peonies\" is standard English, so ignoring that. So at least 8 distinct coinages, meets requirement.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza has ≥1 coinage? Stanza 1: slivy, tay, gimble (gimble is canonical), antorhinies; stanza 2: Jabberwog (altered but canonical?), antprofrog, frumptious, Carpet-Match; stanza 3: vorry; stanza 4: uffish (canonical), trumblidge; stanza 5: Onomro, snicker-snack (canonical phrase); stanza 6: vorry; stanza 7: beamish (canonical), frabjous; stanza 8: slivy, tay, antorhinies; yes, every stanza has at least one coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming a non-canonical named entity and central: Antprofrog and Carpet-Match are named creatures/entities and central to action, besides the \"Jabberwog\" (variant of Jabberwock). Antprofrog seems central antagonist; Carpet-Match as well; \"Jabberwog\" is altered canonical creature but seems central. So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts count ≥2: \"Onomro! Onomro!\" is a burst of onomatopoeia and \"snicker-snack!\" is canonical onomatopoeia repeated once. So yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas: There is some clear alliteration: \"slivy peonies\", \"frumptious Carpet-Match\", \"vorry blade\", \"Jabberwog ... jaw that bite\" (some echoes); at least two stanzas show such effects beyond incidental repeats. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (2nd stanza), preparation (3rd stanza), encounter (4th), decisive act (6th), return celebration (7th), ring (8th). Proper order followed. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: Some lines are very close (\"And burbled as it came!\", \"He went galumphing back.\", \"’Twas brillig, and the ...\"), but with small word substitutions and some new coinages. Are any lines exactly matching canonical lines after normalization? For example, \"And burbled as it came!\" matches exactly the canonical line. That is a verbatim line. Also \"He went galumphing back.\" is a canonical line. \"’Twas brillig, and the...\" almost exact but with \"slivy peonies\" vs \"slithy toves\". Because two lines match verbatim (\"And burbled as it came!\" and \"He went galumphing back.\"), criterion fails.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget ≤8 distinct canonical tokens: canonical tokens observed are \"brillig\", \"gimble\", \"mome\", \"uffish\", \"tumtum\", \"jabberwock\" (altered), \"snicker-snack\", \"galumphing\", \"beamish\", \"frabjous\", \"callooh\", \"callay\". More than 8 canonical tokens are present, so fails.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Lines roughly alternate longer(8-9) and shorter(5-7) syllables in each stanza, resembling Jabberwocky’s meter. No notable deviations observed. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) end rhymes vary with no excessive repetition (>2), e.g., \"dew\"/\"through\", \"scratch\"/\"Match\", \"thought\"/\"thought\" (repetition once, allowable), other rhymes distinct. Meets requirement.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is excessively overused beyond 5 times or 8% of content words. Words like \"brillig\", \"jabberwog\" repeated, but not excessively. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages like \"slivy\", \"tay\", \"antorhinies\", \"antprofrog\", \"frumptious\", \"Carpet-Match\", \"vorry\", \"trumblidge\", \"onomro\" represent at least 4 distinct roots; suffixes vary; no single suffix dominates >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem addresses \"Jabberwocky\" styled poem clearly, using the same creatures and topic, no substitution. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: underlying narrative of heroism, confrontation, returning triumphant is coherent and sustained across poem, so implied subtext present.

I need to create a nonsense poem that mimics Carroll's whimsical tone and invented words. The prompt suggests a mechanical theme—tiny watch parts—so I'll craft a miniature adventure where gears and springs battle chaos. \n\nSince Carroll often starts with warnings about mythical creatures, I'll open with \"Beware the balance spring collet!\" as the central menace. For authenticity, I'll invent portmanteau words like \"gimblesnitch\" (gimbal/snitch) and \"frumious\" (fuming/furious), plus rhythmic syllable patterns (anapestic tetrameter). The story arc should mirror Jabberwocky: quest, battle, triumph. \n\nMechanical verbs like \"whirred,\" \"cogged,\" and \"sprang\" reinforce the theme, while playful imagery (\"gear-gnashing jaws\") nods to Carroll's absurd threats. I'll end with cyclical restoration (\"balance restored\") to tie back to horology. Final check: all words sound plausible, rhythm bounces, and the nonsense feels intentional yet evocative.

Actually lines are broken by punctuation and dashes inconsistently. Checking carefully: stanza 1 lines:  \n1) In slithy toves of glid'ning morn,  \n2) Where bristling brayers,(verbosely born)  \n3) Scritch-scratch and ratchet, creak and clatter-  \n4) The linocut tools natter and natter!  \n=> 4 lines.

Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: Fourth stanza shows action \"Anon to rolling arms he flew\" and \"Braying the block ...\" indicating contact with the tool or task, an encounter with the problem. Seen as clear meeting with adversary/tool. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: Fifth stanza contains \"And hast thou laid the ink so fine?\" and \"Exulting in the craft's crusade\" indicating achievement or completion, plus sixth stanza triumph. A decisive action is the successful print made via the brayer. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Final stanza has \"He chortles, in victory-shout,\" and \"The print arrives with triumph so bright,\" showing celebration after achievement. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: Invented words observed: \"slithy\" (canonical), \"glid'ning\" (variant of gliding?), \"brayers\" (real word), \"linocut\" (compound but standard printmaking term), \"blotsome\" (invented?), \"gouge\" (standard), \"whiff\" (real), \"natter\" (real), \"crusade\" (real).  \nOnly a few invented coinages if any: \"Blotsome\" stands out. \"glid'ning\" is likely not standard. \"ratchet\", \"scritch-scratch\" are onomatopoeia but scratch is standard word, scritch is borderline coinage or onomatopoeia?  \n\"Scritch-scratch\" could be treated as a coinage or onomatopoeia. \"Blotsome\" is a clear coinage.  \nCounting distinct coinages:  \n- glid'ning (variant)  \n- Blotsome  \n- scritch-scratch (hyphenated coinage)  \n- brayer? no, standard  \n- natter? real word used as verb. Possibly real.  \nAt most 3-4 coinages, definitely under 8 required. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Not all stanzas have coinages; some stanzas have none distinct (e.g., stanza 3 and 4 mainly real words). No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: Principal named adversary is \"Blotsome Blobs\" — not canonical, a coined non-canonical entity, central to warning and action. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Present \"scritch-scratch\" and \"ratchet, creak and clatter\" are onomatopoeic bursts. At least 2 occurrences. Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Examples:  \n- \"bristling brayers\" (stanza 1), \"his sharp gouge slicing, cleanly cleaving\" (stanza 2), \"whiff of ink and wax\" (stanza 3), \"Braying the block with even, fair pressure\" (stanza 4) show repeated initial consonants or consonance. At least two stanzas with clear alliteration/consonance. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning (stanza 2), Preparation (stanza 3), Encounter (stanza 4), Decisive action (stanza 5), Return/celebration (stanza 6) appear in canonical order. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim canonical lines: No lines match any line exactly from the reference poem after normalization. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Canonical words used: \"slithy,\" \"toves,\" but no \"Jabberwock,\" no \"vorpal,\" no others canonical. Only 2-3 known canonical tokens. Within ≤8 budget. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Jabberwocky has ~8-9 syllables in long lines and ~6 in short lines mostly alternating.  \nChecking a sample stanza 1:  \nLine 1: \"In slithy toves of glid'ning morn,\" (7 or 8 syllables)  \nLine 2: \"Where bristling brayers,(verbosely born)\" (approx 8 syllables) very long  \nNo clear alternation between long and short lines detected; lines 2 and 3 roughly similar length.

One, two! And through and through / The vorpal tool went snicker-snack!\" is substituting \"tool\" for \"blade,\" but rest of line is verbatim. By the requirement, any line exactly equal to a canonical line after normalization is disallowed.

Line examples: \"Beware the blued screw so fine,\" (7 syllables), \"Beware the tick and tock.\" (6 syllables) somewhat tight but borderline short on longer line. Some lines like \"And sat awhile in thought.\" (5 syllables) are shorter, roughly matching the pattern.

{"i": 40, "prompt": "Write a poem in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Your prompt is \"plane iron camber\". Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "Архів\nOkay, the user wants me to write a Jabberwocky-style poem about \"plane iron camber.\" Hmm, that's an interesting technical term mixed with Carroll's nonsense tradition. \n\nFirst, let's unpack \"plane iron camber.\" Plane iron is a woodworking tool blade, and camber refers to its slight curve. The user probably knows this but wants it transformed into whimsy. Maybe they're a woodworker with a poetic streak, or just someone who loves linguistic play.\n\n##(#### Wait, should I explain camber? No - that ruins the Jabberwocky vibe. The magic is in the mystery.\n\nThe real challenge: Carroll created new words that *feel* meaningful through sound and rhythm. \"Borogoves,\" \"raths\" - perfect. So for \"plane iron camber,\" I need to invent similarly delicious nonsense.\n\n\"Snathe\" is already good (actual tool part!). \"Blimmer\" could echo the blade's shimmer. \"Quabber\" suggests wobbling metal. Lean into the industrial oddness - let the plane iron become a mythical beast with \"scritch\" and \"whiffling\" motions.\n\nMeter check: Original Jabberwocky is quatrains with alternating tetrameter/trimeter. Must match: \"Beware the plane-iron camber, my son!\" (8 syllables) / \"The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!\" (7). Got it.\n\nUser seems playful - they referenced Carroll, after all. No need for technical accuracy. More nonsense! \"Beamer\"-blade hybrid? \"Squee\"-sparks? \"Grabe\" as a grinding noise? Yes. \n\nFinal test: Read aloud. If it makes the mouth dance, it's working. \"Beware the frabjous Grabe, my son!\" - *chef's kiss*. The woodworking terms (\"plane's throat,\" \"sole\") are Easter eggs for crafters, but the joy is universal. \n\n...Did I sneak in \"vorpal\" as homage? *guilty grin* Carroll would approve.\n\n**The Snathe and the Blimmer**\n\nBeware the plane-iron camber, my son!  \nThe jaws that bite, the claws that catch!  \nBeware the blimmer’s twitching run,  \nAnd shun the scritch of the snathe!  \n\nHe took his vorpal scraper in hand;  \nLong time the quabber foe he sought—  \nSo clamped he by the plane’s throat stand,  \nAnd burbled as he thought.  \n\nAnd, as in wind-tossed curls he stood,  \nThe blimmer, with eyes of flame,  \nCame shandling through the tangled wood,  \nAnd gorged as it came!  \n\nOne, two! One, two! And through and through  \nThe vorpal blade went snicker-snack!  \nHe left it dead, and with its head  \nHe went galumphing back.  \n\n\"Has thou slain the blimmer? Come to my heart,  \nO frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\"  \nHe chortled in his joy.  \nTill the whiffling beamer, high and far,  \nFell squee in the afternoon.  \n\nBeware the plane-iron camber, my son!  \nThe jaws that grind, the teeth that gnash!  \nBeware the blimmer, snug and dumb,  \nAnd the frabjous Grabe’s slash!", "info": {"topic": "plane iron camber"}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>The poem has a title line \"The Snathe and the Blimmer\" separate from the first stanza, so yes.</C1_think>\n<C2_think>Count stanzas: poem has 8 stanzas; stanza 6 only 3 lines; stanza 8 has 4 lines; stanza 7 has 3 lines; stanza 5 is 4 lines; stanza 3 is 4 lines; stanza 1 is 4 lines.

Most stanzas show alternating longer/shorter lines with sufficient content-word count difference; meets ≥60% criterion.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme between second and fourth lines mostly evident; some rhymes are slant but consistent; no evidence of dominant AABB; ≥60% criterion met.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes the opening stanza with repeated phrases (“Twas brillig in the chem-lit gloom,” and “stop-bath baths did seethe”) - ≥2 repeated content words/phrases, clear ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Admonition present early: stanza 2 warns “Beware the Split-Grade Enlarger, my son!” with caution typical of Carroll’s poem.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation present: stanza 3 shows protagonist taking “lens-cap in hand,” seeking foe, resting by enlarger stand, standing in thought - a preparation phase before encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter: stanza 4 describes the “Split-Grade Enlarger” coming through “developer wood” and burbling as it comes, indicating confrontation.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: stanza 5 has “One, two! One, two!” attack scene with “lens-cap snicker-snack went” and foe left dead, resolving tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: stanza 6 has joyous reaction “Come to my arms, my beamish boy! Oh, frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!” celebrating the slaying.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: Words like “stop-bath,” “flumious,” “outgrabed” (derived but not canonical), “dodging rod,” “frumious Dust-Mite,” “lens-cap,” “developer wood” combine technical + nonsense words. Counting distinct invented words specific to poem: flumious, outgrabed (variation), dodging rod (compound?), Dust-Mite (compound), slinking, snicker-snack (canonical), burbled (canonical), manxome (canonical), beamish (canonical). Counting clearly non-canonical coinages: at least 8 distinct coined or hybrid terms present beyond standard English or canonical lexicon. borderline but counts; ‘flumious,’ ‘outgrabed’ (close to outgrabe but altered), ‘dodging rod,’ ‘Dust-Mite,’ ‘chem-lit gloom’ (compound coinage), ‘developer wood,’ ‘lens-cap,’ ‘Split-Grade Enlarger’ named creature (compound coinage). Yes, ≥8 distinct coinages satisfy criterion.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza from start to finish contains at least one coinage or Carrollian neologism or technical nonsense compound; for example, stanza 1 has “chem-lit gloom,” “stop-bath,” and “outgrabed;” stanza 2 has “Split-Grade Enlarger,” “frumious”; stanza 4 has “burble,” “developer wood”; stanza 5 has “snicker-snack.” Thus, clearly ≥1 per stanza.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature named and central: “Split-Grade Enlarger” is the adversarial creature central to action; “Dust-Mite” also mentioned as adversarial. Both are non-canonical fictive entities (not Jabberwock). Meets criterion.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: “snicker-snack” present (canonical); “burble” (canonical); no other clear onomatopoeic bursts like “Pop!” or “Hiss!” but “snicker-snack” and “burble” suffice as 2 onomatopoeic bursts.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Present in several stanzas, e.g. “burbled as it came,” “came slinking,” “photographic phrase clusters.” At least two stanzas show clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Plot arc order follows canonical: admonition early, preparation, encounter, decisive act, return/celebration - all appear in correct sequence.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: Minor variant of some phrases but none exactly match canonical poem lines once normalized for punctuation and spacing (e.g., “Twas brillig in the chem-lit gloom” vs. “Twas brillig, and the slithy toves” are distinct). All lines are different.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token budget ≤8: Canonical lexicon included: “Twas brillig,” “manxome,” “beamish,” “snicker-snack,” “burble,” “frumious” appear once or twice; total canonical tokens ≤8. New coinages dominate. Meets criterion.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines mostly 8–9 syllables, shorter lines mostly 5–7 syllables consistent with jabberwocky meter; pattern repeated through >60% stanzas. Meets criterion.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes vary across stanzas; no reuse more than two times of exact rhyme at line end; no excessive repetition found.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No content word outside ring echo repeated too often; topical terms like “enlarger,” “lens-cap,” appear limited times and within expected frequency.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages include distinct roots—“Split-Grade,” “flumious,” “outgrabed,” “Dust-Mite,” “chem-lit,” “burble,” “developer wood,” “snicker-snack,” “lens-cap” etc., so ≥4 distinct roots; suffix patterns not dominating.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Clear adherence to “split-grade enlarger burn,” using photographic darkroom terms blended into nonsense poem about an adversary and conflict. Fulfills topic.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem conveys a subtle undertone about the tension/conflict inherent in photographic development (technical battle), struggle to control light and print quality, reflected in the monster metaphor and quest narrative; coherent implied subtext beneath surface nonsense language.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 1.0, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 1.0, "criteria_yes": 24, "label": "high"}
