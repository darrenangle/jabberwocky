New coinages are limited to O1 Blade and Tungstitre. So fewer than required coinages per stanza.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named: O1 Blade is named and central to the poem's action (not Jabberwock but replacement foe).

No end word repeats more than twice excluding potential ring echo (which is absent). Rhyme variety acceptable → yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Content word repetition variants:  \nNo single content word obviously overused beyond thresholds. Frequency balanced. → yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show ≥4 distinct roots?  \nOnly \"Opsihawk\", \"Jabberwimp\", \"Oplan\" are coinages.

The mention of \"in-lay ribbon\" is at the admonition stanza but no explicit preparation described. Preparation stage weak or absent.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter between quillow and bandersnatch in stanza 6; \"they fought with might,\" marking confrontation.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action in stanza 7: \"the quillow... made mince and quince of the frumious beast\" indicates resolution of conflict.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration in stanza 7 and 8: rejoice lines \"O frabjous day!

Approx 6 to 7 strong invented, not counting standard English. Probably under 8 distinct coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinages appear dispersed: stanza 1 - brixome, slymy; stanza 2 no obvious coinage; stanza 3 - hissen; stanza 4-6 doring, snickersnacket; stanza 7 mince and quince (phrase), stanza 8 no new coinage. Not all stanzas have coinage; fewer than 8 stanzas have coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>A non-canonical creature named: \"quillow\" is central to action, distinct from \"Jabberwock.\" Bandersnatch appears but is canonical. The quillow is named and is protagonist creature. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"snickersnacket\" (variant of canonical \"snicker-snack,\" but arguably onomatopoeic), some speech bursts but only one obvious onomatopoeic burst. Not ≥2 strong onomatopoeia words like \"Pop!\" or \"Hiss!\".</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: multiple stanzas show alliteration e.g., \"brixome in the wabe, and slymy toves,\" \"speculum treasures to share.\" At least 2 stanzas with clear alliteration beyond incidental. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning (stanza 3), encounter (6), decisive act (7), return celebration (7–8). Preparation stage weak or missing (no clear prior plan). Arc order partially followed but missing preparation stage.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line verbatim matches the canonical poem. Canonical words reused, but not exact lines.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token frequency: borogoves, mimsy, mome, raths, outgrabe, frumious, bandersnatch, gyre, gimble, wabe appear. At least 9 or 10 distinct canonical tokens too many (the poem uses \"bandersnatch,\" \"frumious,\" \"mome,\" \"raths,\" \"borogoves,\" \"mimsy,\" \"outgrabe,\" \"gyre,\" \"gimble,\" \"wabe,\" \"slymy\" possibly a coinage). Probably >8 canonical tokens.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Lines roughly attempt ~8-9 syllables for longer lines and ~5-7 for shorter lines. Some lines irregular, stanza 3 with 3 lines breaks pattern. Not perfectly consistent but mostly close.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Stanzas mostly have different (2,4) rhyme endings; no evidence of >2 repeats of same end word besides ring repetition. Variety is acceptable.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No single content word overused excessively; reused canonical words are common but below threshold. No problem.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages like \"Cewter,\" \"Quillow,\" \"brixome,\" \"slymy,\" \"doring,\" \"snickersnacket,\" \"hissen,\" \"mince and quince\" have varied roots, no single suffix dominates. Over 4 distinct roots; yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem addresses parody of Jabberwocky with a non-canonical creature Quillow, battle with bandersnatch, fits topic well.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Implied motifs of caution, bravery, triumph, and celebration across poem, consistent undertone present.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.6666666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.6666666666666666, "criteria_yes": 16, "label": "medium"}

So yes for this.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>The rhyme scheme (2,4 rhyme) is preserved as in the original, with slant rhyme allowance.

Beware the flipflopping rain... shun The frumious puddles\" - clear warning. -> yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Third stanza shows preparation: \"Take careful heed\", \"Heed how they drizzle...\", indicating alertness and resolve before encounter. -> yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Fourth stanza shows encounter or confrontation with \"droplets pitter-pattering in wild glee\" and action \"Be sharpish in dispatching\" implying confrontation. So yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Fifth stanza shows decisive action with plinker droplets rattling and clattering, ending with \"Oh!

Counting distinct invented coined roots ignoring compounds or English words: at least 8 distinct new coinages (tintinnabulous, splatteroo, toopling, reezle, breezeling, spangle, fraddle, glibgarous, jinglers, toopled, vadling) -> yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least 1 coinage: \"tintinnabulous splatteroo\", \"glibgarous\", \"flipflopping\", \"toopling tears\", \"toopled\", \"vadling\" etc. All 6 stanzas contain at least one coinage -> yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Splatteroo is a coined creature/entity, named and central to poem’s action (rain and drops called \"splatteroo\").
