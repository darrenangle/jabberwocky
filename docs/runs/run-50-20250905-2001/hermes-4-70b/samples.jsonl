One, two! And through and through \nThe vorpal blade went snicker-snack! \nHe left it dead, and with its head \nHe went galumphing back. \n\nAnd hast thou slain the Jabberwock? \nCome to my arms, my beamish boy! \nO frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! \nHe chortled in his joy. \n\nTwas brilling, and the slithy raves \nDid gyre and kimble in the glade; \nAll mimsy were the borogoves, \nAnd the mome raths outgrabed.", "info": {}}
