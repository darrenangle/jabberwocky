The action is verbal/tamed but not as definitive or forceful as slaying.

Also, no dominance of AABB rhyme pattern; rhyme mostly ABAB or similar.

So yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The poem follows canonical arc: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive action → return/celebration in correct order. So yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim lines: No line exactly matches canonical poem lines. Common words appear but no exact line matches when normalizing quotes/dashes/whitespace. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexicon budget: canonical tokens used are few: “mome”, “uffish”, “snicker-snack”, “gyre”, “wimble” (modified coinage?), “mome” and “snicker-snack” repeated at small count. Approx. ≤8 canonical tokens (mostly mome, uffish, snicker-snack, gyre). The poem favors new coinages. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines ≈8–9 syllables, shorter lines ≈5–7 measured roughly match Jabberwocky pattern throughout. For example, “’Twas blixen, and the zaffre loaves” (7-8 syllables), “Did gyre and wimble in the bake;” (7-8 syllables), and shorter lines fit 5–7. Consistent pattern in all quatrains. So yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes differ stanza to stanza: bake/shake, son/dreams, hand/zest, might/blight, snicker-snack/back, boy/ploy, bake/fake. No end word reused >2 times except for final ring stanza reusing opening rhyme words; overall good rhyme variety. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No single content word dominates (no word >5x or >8% content words) except canonical repeated words intentionally for ring echo. No overuse detected. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages like blixen, zaffre, wimble, kurz, mome rimes, frabulous, levain, loafy, trumpax, floss show multiple distinct roots and suffixes. No suffix dominates over 50%. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses the “Yeasted Blunderbuss,” a Jabberwocky-style invented creature, echoing the original poem’s story arc on a similar topic of a fantastic monster confrontation. So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is subtle thematic undertone on baking, breadmaking as a heroic quest—admonition, preparation, and defeat of a yeast-based monster. This coherent motif/undertone carries through, so yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.9583333333333334, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.9583333333333334, "criteria_yes": 23, "label": "high"}

Stanza count is 5, which is within the 5 to 8 range. So yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter requires alternating longer and shorter lines with at least 2 content words difference in ≥60% of stanzas. Metre is irregular; some stanzas have lines near equal length or no clear alternate line length pattern. Only about 2 stanzas show clear longer/shorter alternation. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>In the stanzas, lines 2 and 4 mostly rhyme or slant rhyme with exceptions; stanza 2 rhyme \"snarl/darl\" (slant), stanza 1 \"keen/green\", stanza 3 \"flow/sun\" (no rhyme), stanza 4 \"see/be\" (slant), stanza 5 \"dwell/reveal\" (slant at best). So rhyming (2,4) occurs in at least 3/5 stanzas (60%). No AABB dominance is notable. Thus, marginally yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza does not repeat any content words or phrases from the first stanza nor have a clear refrain that echoes the opening stanza. So no ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>There is an early admonition in stanza 2: \"Beware the burl! ... Take heed\". This fulfills the warning/admonition criterion.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>The protagonist prepares by taking a stance and steadying breath before the encounter, shown in stanza 3: \"He took his stance with a breath so slow\". This counts as preparation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>There is no explicit adversary encounter or confrontation. The poem is about woodworking and tool use, describing the tools and the process but not a clear meeting with a creature or foe. So no clear encounter.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>There is no decisive act that resolves a tension; the poem describes action but no conflict resolution or slaying-like event. So no.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>The poem includes a kind of ending/reminder to rest and dream, but no clear return or jubilant celebration of victory. So no clear return/celebration.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Counting invented coinages: \"carver\", \"wavy grain\", \"wood-sprite\" (possibly standard compounds), \"burl\", \"darl\" (probably invented), \"fishtail gouge\", \"whiff\" (onomatopoeic, but standard?), \"whirl\", \"swoosh\" (standard onomatopoeia), \"marvel\", \"fishtail gouge sweep\" (compound name), \"spirits free\" (standard). Only \"darl\" stands out strongly as invented coinage; \"burl\" is a real woodworking term. Estimated fewer than 8 distinct coinages. So no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Does each stanza contain at least one coinage? Stanza 2 has \"burl\", \"darl\" (invented?), stanza 1 \"carver\", \"wavy grain\" (not coinage), stanza 3 onomatopoeic words \"whiff\", \"whirl\", \"swoosh\" (standard onomatopoeia), stanza 4 no clear coinages, stanza 5 none. So no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>There is no clearly named non-canonical creature or entity. \"Wood-sprite\" might count as an entity but it's generic and not central to an adversarial or dramatic action. So no.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>At least 2 onomatopoeic bursts: \"whiff!\", \"whirl!\", \"swoosh!\". These are onomatopoeia used clearly as bursts. So yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance occurs notably in stanza 1 (\"carver\", \"keen\", \"gleam/green\", \"wavy\", \"wood-sprite\", \"gleeful/refrain\" somewhat), stanza 2 (\"burl\", \"bit\", \"bash\", \"darl\" not alliteration); stanza 3 (\"chisel\", \"danced\", \"shavings flow\") mild; so at least two stanzas show clear alliteration/consonance. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order checks: warning is stanza 2, preparation stanza 3, but then no clear encounter stanza, no decisive action, no return. Arc beats appear out of canonical order or missing. So no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines verbatim match canonical poem lines. The content is distinct, no exact matches after normalization. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens like \"beware\" appear, but no canonical lexicon words like \"vorpal\", \"mome\", \"frumious\", etc. Canonical token count ≤8 favoring new coinages is met. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts: longer lines range from ~8-11 syllables, shorter lines about 6-8 syllables — somewhat matching Jabberwocky’s ~8/6 pattern, but not very tight or consistent in every stanza. Borderline, so no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: rhymes (2,4) vary; \"snarl/darl\", \"keen/green\", \"flow/sun\" (no rhyme), \"see/be\", \"dwell/reveal\" all differ. No rhyme word repeated more than twice. So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No lexical overuse is evident; no single content word exceeds 5 repetitions or 8% frequency outside ring echo. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages are few and not varied; only one or two invented roots appear (mostly standard English words used in new ways). So no.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>The poem clearly addresses the topic of a \"fishtail gouge sweep\" tool and woodworking, quite distinct from Jabberwock theme. It does not substitute a different subject unrelated to the implied topic. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>There is some implied subtext about craftsmanship, patience, artistry, and respect for tools, which functions as a coherent undertone beyond surface action.
