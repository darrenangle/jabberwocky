at most 2-3 invented words; fewer than 8 distinct coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinages appear in some stanzas but not every stanza clearly contains a coined word; e.g., 2nd stanza has \"vigilITE\" and \"lunarite\", 1st stanza \"nightestime\" \"lunarade\", 3rd stanza \"magical\" is normal, 4th stanza no coinages; so fewer than 4 stanzas have coinages.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>No non-canonical creature/entity named and central to the action; vigilante and flower are normal concepts; \"vigilITE\" looks somewhat coined but it's more a role/title, not a named creature.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>No onomatopoeic bursts (no pop/burbled/snicker-snack or similar bursts); none detected.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>No especially clear within-line alliteration or consonance beyond normal incidental repeats; not evident in 2+ stanzas.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc beats are absent or ambiguous: no warning, no clear preparation, no encounter, no decisive action, no return/celebration in canonical order; arc order not met.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No exact line copied verbatim from canonical poem; wording and lines differ distinctly.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used: \"’Twas\" not used, \"cereus\", \"nightestime\", \"vigilITE\", \"lunarite\" are new; no canonical Lewis Carroll coinages seen; so canonical tokens ≤8, yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count roughly fits shorter lines ~6-7 syllables and longer lines ~8-9 (e.g., stanza 1 lines: 7,7,6,7 syllables), but not strongly consistent; overall borderline, but since must be clearly met, answer no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: 2,4 line rhyme limited and somewhat repetitive; rhyme words \"gloom\"/\"moon\", \"strode\"/\"light\", \"sight\"/\"delight\", \"break\"/\"take\" show some variation and no reuse >2 times; rhymes varied enough.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No overused single content word; no word repeated excessively; lexical repetition guard satisfied.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages appear to have distinct roots \"nightestime\", \"vigilITE\", \"lunarade\", \"lunarite\"; 4 distinct coinage roots; yes for variety.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem topic seems to be the night-blooming cereus and its vigil, fitting its title; topic adherence seems clear and consistent; no substitution of subject.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext is minimal;

At least 4 of 6 stanzas have this alternation, so ≥60%. So yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (lines 2 and 4) occurs mostly: For 6 stanzas, 5 show a rhyme (blue/chew, hand/stand, dell/quell, wait/abate, man/bands), none as AABB. So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes opening stanza content words or phrases: The first stanza references “pantograph” and “arcing blue,” the last stanza references “pantograph” and “blue” again, plus “frabjous cheers” may echo “frabjous” from Carroll’s poem but not from first stanza here. There is >2 repeated content words between first and last stanza (“pantograph,” “blue,” “arcing”). So yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Is there an early warning or admonition (e.g., “Beware…”)? No explicit admonition or caution to the protagonist exists in any stanza.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before encounter: In stanza 2, “With vorpal spanner in his hand. He sought the pantograph to pry” shows some preparation, carrying the tool and intent to act. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>A clear encounter happens: In stanza 4, “At last he reached the arc of blue, The pantograph in silent wait” describes the meeting. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>There is a decisive act resolving tension: “With one swift spanner-strike, he slew The blueness, leaving it abate.” - decisive action present.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: In stanza 6, “He took the blue and home he ran, With frabjous cheers and clapping hands.

Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented coinages: brangent, frotis, thrave, snerkly, plorpy, snoves, glumious, bandrils, Gyven, vorpal (canonical), pantograph (not canonical coinage but a real word), pry(not coinage), flubdub, quzbies, zancky, fleems, snerkled, zorks, blueness (not coinage), abate (no), frabjous (canonical), galumphing no, so excluding canonical tokens and normal words, counting 10+ distinct coinages. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains ≥1 coinage distinctly invented: stanza 1 (brangent, frotis, thrave, plorpy, snoves, bandrils), stanza 2 (Gyven), stanza 3 (flubdub, quzbies, zancky, fleems, snerkled, zorks), stanza 4 (arc of blue, but no clear coinage except “abate” which is standard word, so maybe no new coinage), stanza 5 (no coinages except “frabjous” which is canonical), stanza 6 (frabjous, clapping, no coinage). So stanza 4 and 5 lacking unique coinage? Stanza 4 no new coinage, stanza 5 no coinage; fails the criterion. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>A non-canonical creature/entity named and central to action: “Gyven” is the protagonist's name but no named creature or adversary other than the “pantograph,” which is a mechanical device, not a coined creature.

No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas beyond incidental usage: examples like “pantograph did arcing blue,” “plorpy snoves and glumious bandrils chew” show minor alliteration but not strong or clear pattern in ≥2 stanzas.

Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes differ stanza to stanza. rhymes are blue/chew, hand/stand, dell/quell, wait/abate, hands/man, yes varied and no end word repeated >2 times.

Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly addresses a stylized “Jabberwocky”-like monster or adversary in the form of a pantograph’s blue arc; fitting the theme of a confrontation and mythic battle.

Other stanzas also irregular. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety (2,4 end rhymes) must be varied across stanzas. Only stanza 1 shows rhyme on lines 2 & 4, repeating \"throw\" and \"flow.\" Others no rhyme or different endings.

The first stanza lines are 4, second stanza 4, third stanza 4, fourth stanza 4, fifth stanza 4, sixth stanza 2 only (\"Thus ended...\" and summary line).

Poem opens already with a scene, no warning stanza. Preparation is vague.

At least 8 canonical tokens used but not excessive; borderline; probably ≤8 distinct canonical tokens used so yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines loosely around 8-9 syllables, shorter around 5-7. Given bizarre line lengths and uneven syllable counts, does not consistently meet strict syllable pattern. No consistent 8/6 pattern across quatrains.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: rhyme scheme and rhymes are sparse and uneven with some partial slant rhymes repeated and no large variety across stanzas; some rhymes repeated exactly more than 2 times; fails variety requirement.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no single content word overused notably; coinages and normal words distribute; no overuse found; yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: many coinages with different roots (\"clogomorph,\" \"fractal-garbed,\" \"toumsylation,\" \"vtrasound\"), root variety ≥4; no dominating suffix seen; yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem addresses the topic by featuring \"plane iron’s camber\" in a surreal adventurous narrative, which corresponds with the given prompt without diverging into unrelated topics; yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: poem’s meaning is highly abstract and obscure, subtext lacking coherent or detectable underlying motif or undertone beyond surface surrealism; no clear subtext.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>no</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.375, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 0.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 0.0, "C16_arc_order": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 0.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 1.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.375, "criteria_yes": 9, "label": "low"}

Less than 60% stanzas clearly have this alternating longer/shorter pattern with ≥2 distinct content words difference. Likely no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme of lines 2 and 4 occurs often but includes slant rhymes (fright/rig, said/head, wet/met, band/grand, rang/might, trees/bliss).
