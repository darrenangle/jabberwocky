Only one strong onomatopoeia is clear; the other is borderline as “burbled” is somewhat onomatopoeic but less burst-like.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>At least two stanzas (e.g. stanza 2 \"Steaming Squirble,\" \"frumious Handle-Grips\"; stanza 5 \"One, two!

This is in correct order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines are exact matches of the canonical poem lines after normalization. Some phrases (\"vorpal,\" \"snicker-snack,\" \"beamish boy\") are canonical tokens but not verbatim lines. The ring echo stanza repeats first stanza from model poem, not from canonical poem.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens included: \"Beware,\" \"vorpal,\" \"frumious,\" \"uffish\" (once), \"snicker-snack,\" \"beamish,\" and some from canonical lexicon reused (\"frumious,\" \"vorpal,\" \"snicker-snack,\" \"beamish,\" and \"uffish\" once). Count is about 6-7 distinct canonical tokens, thus ≤8, so canonical budget is within limit.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts in quatrains approximate Jabberwocky’s pattern: longer lines around 8-9 syllables (e.g. \"’Twas steamy in the tokonome\" =7–8 syllables, slightly short but close; “The kyusu cracked, the sencha flew” =7 syllables), shorter lines around 5-7 syllables. Syllable pattern is reasonably tight in each stanza.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme in (2,4) is varied with at least 4 different rhyme sets, and no end word in (2,4) reused more than twice excluding the ring echo. Rhyme variety meets criterion.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No content word is repeated excessively. Most coinages and other content words appear less than 5 times or well below 8% threshold. Lexical repetition is controlled.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show variety with at least 4 distinct root types: “Sencha,” “Kyusu,” “Steaming Squirble,” “Handle-Grips,” “tokonome,” “ocha,” “ebon,” “Pourcha-day.” No suffix dominates >50% of coinages.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>The poem clearly addresses the same topic—an odd tea-related creature/adventure (Sencha-Kyusu Drip)—in a style imitative of Jabberwocky and does not substitute a different subject.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>The poem suggests an undertone about a tea ritual or brewing ceremony as a quest with risks and rewards, a coherent implied layer beyond surface action, consistent motif across the poem.</C24_think>\n</think>\n\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.9583333333333334, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.9583333333333334, "criteria_yes": 23, "label": "high"}
