{"i": 1, "prompt": "Write a poem in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Your prompt is \"hollow grind on an O1 blade\". Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "The Hollowgrindle Bristle-Shave\n\n’Twas clickle-tock in cobberwick, the O1 steel was gleaming,\nThe grindstone spun in wiggy-whirrs, the sparks were richly streaming.\nIts hollow hoonk and razor-spoke came sighing through the gloam—\nA snake-thin cree, a whistle-flense, the edge-bite hard as loam.\nBeware the Hollowgrindle Blade, that sings its thinning tune!\nThe spine-bright name it whispers’ loud beneath the crystal moon.\n\nIt tsippered at the bevel-clouds and carped the angle trim; \nIt dipped the hollow’s lunary arc—an ululant, skating rim—  \nThen snicker-snack! went keening back, honed thinner than a tale,\nTo cleave the fluff of ferny stuff and part the paper vale.\nHe took his inner-sited guide; though thumb it throbbed with dread—\nHe wrought O1 edge of wasp-wing thin (no mortice heart to wed).\n\nThe sparks in cavious caverns flew, they spiralled jinnish bright;\nThe oil-blood flowed in copper gloom to cool the humming bite.\n“Come, Hollowgrindle!  Sing me keen,” the sharp-crafter did cry,\n“And slice the strop like molten dusk upon the cobalt sky!”\nHe blinked thrice past the linen cross, and flashing through the bind,\nAcross the burr it skirled and purled, leaving dawn-signed mind.\n\nOne final stroke—one hushing note—and silent gloaming ceased:\nThe hollow grind stood glassy fine, its teeth of starlight creased.\nA tremor through the workshop ran, a whisper soft but sore:\n“O child of sparks and O1 dark, beware such edges—more!”\nFor blades bone-narrow have long eyes that open at the throat—\nThe Hollowgrindle’s slender song still rings the midnight moat.", "info": {"topic": "hollow grind on an O1 blade"}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>Title present as a separate line before first stanza: \"The Hollowgrindle Bristle-Shave\" - yes.</C1_think>\n<C2_think>Stanza count and shape: The poem has 5 stanzas. Check stanza line counts:  \n- Stanza 1: 6 lines  \n- Stanza 2: 6 lines  \n- Stanza 3: 6 lines  \n- Stanza 4: 6 lines  \n- Stanza 5: 6 lines  \nNo quatrains (4-line stanzas). All stanzas have 6 lines, total 5 stanzas which is within 5-8, but stanza line count is not 4 lines. So fails quatrain and stanza count shape criteria.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter echo: Need alternating longer and shorter lines in ≥60% of stanzas with ≥2 content-word difference. Lines are 6 per stanza, no clear alternation of long/short lines by line number. Pattern does not match Jabberwocky’s alternating line lengths. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme: Jabberwocky requires rhymes in lines (2,4), with varied rhyme scheme avoiding AABB dominance. Here stanzas are 6 lines, rhyme pattern is unclear or irregular. Also no note of rhyme detected in 2 and 4 lines strongly. No solid evidence for rhyme in (2,4). So no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The last stanza does not echo opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases or a clear refrain. The last stanza is different in content, no repeated phrases from first stanza. So no.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning admonition: 1st stanza ends with \"Beware the Hollowgrindle Blade, that sings its thinning tune!\". This is an admonition to beware the blade, satisfying early statement of caution. So yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation armament: The 3rd stanza shows \"He took his inner-sited guide; though thumb it throbbed with dread—He wrought O1 edge of wasp-wing thin (no mortice heart to wed).\" This reads as preparation and armament before final act. So yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter confrontation: The poem lacks a clear adversary or meeting scene; no explicit confrontation with creature/entity. It focuses on the blade and its crafting, but no adversarial meeting or external creature encounter. So no.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying decisive action: There is a \"one final stroke\" in stanza 4, but it is about honing the blade, not slaying a creature or decisive confrontation event. No clear slaying or resolution given. So no.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return celebration: No clear return or jubilant acknowledgement or celebration after action. Poem ends with cautionary tone. No return/celebration. So no.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Coinages notable here include \"Hollowgrindle,\" \"Bristle-Shave,\" \"clickle-tock,\" \"cobberwick,\" \"wiggy-whirrs,\" \"hoonk,\" \"whistle-flense,\" \"tsippered,\" \"lunary,\" \"ululant,\" \"skirled,\" \"purled,\" \"cavious,\" \"jinnish.\" Well above 8 distinct coinages. So yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza contains coined words:  \n- Stanza 1: \"clickle-tock,\" \"cobberwick,\" \"wiggy-whirrs,\" \"hoonk,\" \"whistle-flense\"  \n- Stanza 2: \"tsippered,\" \"lunary,\" \"ululant,\" \"snicker-snack\" (canonical)  \n- Stanza 3: \"cavious,\" \"jinnish,\" \"skirled,\" \"purled\"  \n- Stanza 4: \"hushing,\" (less coinage but still \"glossy fine,\" \"teeth of starlight\" - borderline)  \n- Stanza 5: \"midnight moat,\" \"hollowgrindle.\"  \nEach stanza has at least one clearly coined term, so yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: No named non-canonical creature/entity other than the blade \"Hollowgrindle\". The blade is central to action and is personified but it is an object. Since focus is on a blade, which is not a creature but a named entity central to the poem, this counts as yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"snicker-snack\" (canonical), \"sighing,\" \"whistle-flense,\" \"keening back\" may be onomatopoeic or mimic sound, but only \"snicker-snack\" is clear onomatopoeic burst. One canonical onomatopoeic word is present but second unclear. So only one strong onomatopoeia definitely. So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration consonance: Several lines have clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats, for example:  \n- \"clickle-tock,\" \"cobberwick,\" \"Hollowgrindle Blade\"  \n- \"spine-bright name it whispers loud\"  \n- \"sharp-crafter did cry,\" \"slice the strop\"  \nSo yes in multiple stanzas, at least 2 stanzas show clear alliteration.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The arc is warning (stanza 1 admonition), preparation (stanza 3 sword crafting and resolve), but lack of a clear encounter and slaying breaks the arc. The arc does not follow canonical order as the encounter and decisive act occur in different form or not clearly. So no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: No lines match canonical lines exactly upon normalization. Only \"snicker-snack\" is reused from canonical lexicon, which is allowed. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: The poem uses \"snicker-snack\" from canonical lexicon and \"O1\" (not canonical), possibly few others. The canonical tokens are limited and well under 8 distinct canonical tokens. Coinages dominate. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Lines in stanzas mostly run long (10+ syllables), not tight 8-9 /5-7 pattern. No evident alternating syllable pattern similar to Jabberwocky’s. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: No clear structured rhyme pattern in (2,4) lines across stanzas. No evidence of varied rhymes; also no evidence of any rhymes repeated over 2 times. So no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No content word is repeated excessively given poem length and lexical variety. No obvious overuse. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages stem from diverse roots: \"clickle,\" \"cobber,\" \"wiggy,\" \"hoonk,\" \"whistle,\" \"tsipper,\" \"lunary,\" \"ululant,\" \"cavious,\" \"jinnish,\" \"skirl,\" \"purl,\" \"hollowgrindle,\" \"bristle-shave.\" No one suffix accounts for over 50% of coinages. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a blade or sharpening weapon, akin to the weapon in Jabberwocky, not substituting a totally different subject. So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond surface action, the poem implies motif about crafting and cautions against dangerous perfection and mythical weapon power, a coherent implied layer about creation and danger. So yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.5416666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 1.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.5416666666666666, "criteria_yes": 13, "label": "low"}

Since the first stanza is 6 lines, not all stanzas have 4 lines. Fails quatrain shape.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter: At least 5 stanzas are quatrains, review 2 line length alternation and ≥2 content-word difference between longer/shorter lines. Alternation not clearly consistent or systematic in the first stanza (6 lines) and some variance elsewhere. Less than 60% stanzas clearly show alternating longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content-word difference. Likely no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme: In at least 60% stanzas do lines 2 and 4 rhyme? Checking stanzas 2-8 (all quatrains). 2nd stanza (son/spun/call/Petal-Fall) 2,4 do rhyme (call/Fall slant). 3rd stanza (spear/near/stalk/talk) lines 2 and 4 rhyme (near/talk slant rhyme is questionable). 4th stanza (stood/bud/maze/haze) 2 and 4 rhyme (bud/haze - weak rhyme). 5th stanza (through/snoo/dead/bed) 2 and 4 rhyme (snoo/bed - no rhyme). 6th stanza (Peonyant/plant/beamish/plant) lines 2 and 4 rhyme perfectly (plant/plant). This suggests some stanzas rhyme 2 and 4, but there's AABB dominance (stanza 6 is AABB with plant repeated). So less than 60% properly rhyme with avoidance of AABB dominance. Therefore no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Final stanza repeats opening stanza lines (some overlap with stanza 1). The final stanza repeats 4 lines of the first stanza, so echoing with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases. Yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition: The second stanza includes “Beware the Peonyant, my son!” clearly an admonition. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: Third stanza shows preparation—\"He took his vorpal thimble-spear,\" and \"stood awhile in thyme-wrapped talk.\" Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: Fourth stanza shows encounter—\"The Peonyant, with eyes of bud, Came scuttling through the velvet maze.\" Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: Fifth stanza: \"One, two! One, two! And through and through / The thimble-spear went snicker-snoo! / He left it dead,\" indicates decisive slaying. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Sixth stanza returns and celebrates: \"Come to my arms, my beamish plant! / O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\" Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Distinct invented coinages (not standard or canonical): Peonyants, brilgant, scritch, sunbeam-snakes, Bloombug, Petal-Fall, vorpal thimble-spear, bloomish, honeyed stalk, thyme-wrapped talk, dawny, velvet maze, snicker-snoo, beamish plant, petal-spray. At least 14 distinct coinages. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza should have at least one coinage. 1st stanza: brilgant, peonyants, scritch, sunbeam-snakes; 2nd stanza: Peonyant, Bloombug, Petal-Fall; 3rd stanza: vorpal thimble-spear, bloomish, honeyed stalk, thyme-wrapped; 4th stanza: Peonyant, dawny, velvet maze; 5th stanza: thimble-spear, snicker-snoo; 6th stanza: beamish plant, petal-spray; 7th stanza: repeats opening stanza’s coinages, 8th stanza repeats same—So yes, all stanzas contain coinages. Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature named: Peonyant is named and central; also Bloombug and Petal-Fall mentioned, but Peonyant is the main adversary. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"scritch and scritch,\" \"burbled,\" \"snicker-snoo\" mimic onomatopoeic bursts. More than two present. Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Several stanzas have clear alliteration/consonance, e.g., \"petal’s brink\", \"pink to pink\", \"peonyants … petals\", \"dawny thought\", \"thimble-spear went snicker-snoo\". At least two stanzas clearly show this.

Proper canonical order. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: Checking for exact line matches with reference poem lines, normalized. None of the lines exactly match canonical poem lines; some words preserved but line wording differs. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Canonical words used: vorpal, frumious, burbled, snicker-snoo (variation on snicker-snack), beamish, galumphing - about 5 canonical tokens, within 8 maximum. Acceptable. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines need 8-9 syllables, shorter lines 5-7. First stanza with 6 lines makes pattern irregular; checking a few stanzas: stanza 2 (\"Beware the Peonyant, my son!\" = 7 syllables; \"Beware the Bloombug’s whispered call\" = 8) alternates somewhat; stanza 5 (\"One, two! One, two! And through and through\" = 8 syll; \"The thimble-spear went snicker-snoo!\"=8) less clear alternation; overall, not consistent with Jabberwocky’s pattern in 60%+ stanzas. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Stanza 6 repeats \"plant\" twice in rhyme, so exact word reused >2 times. Elsewhere, rhymes vary. Failure to avoid exact repetition >2 times excluding ring echo. No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: Content words do not appear to be overused. No single content word is overused >5 times or >8%. No evidence of overuse.

Multiple distinct roots; no suffix dominates >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-style topic with a creature and an allegorical fight; adheres to the genre/topic. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond surface action, there is a faint motif of nature, growth, and dawn. The adversary is a floral creature, and the setting is a garden at dawn. Possible subtle undertone linking struggle and bloom. Implied layers are detectable but somewhat faint. Acceptable yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.7916666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.7916666666666666, "criteria_yes": 19, "label": "medium"}

On close read, stanzas 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6: stanza 2 appears to have 8 lines (too long), so not all stanzas are 4 lines. Total stanza count is 6, which is in range 5 to 8, but stanza line counts are not all 4 lines.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Check ballad meter alternation of longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content-word difference. By reading the rhythm: The lines in most stanzas do alternate roughly longer and shorter lines with some rhythm changes, but not strongly consistent. For stanza 1: lines alternate approx 8-7-8-7 syllables; stanza 2: doubled length, harder to verify; stanza 3-5 appear to have some alternation. At least 3/6 stanzas show mostly ballad meter pattern, which is below 60% threshold.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme checking: In ≥60% stanzas, lines 2 and 4 rhyme with slant rhyme allowed, and AABB should be avoided. Rhyme includes: stanza 1 ends with \"chum\"/\"numb\"/\"snips\"/\"lips\" (ABAB?), 2nd and 4th lines rhyme (numb/snips/lips) partially. The pattern seems ABAB rather than AABB, which meets the requirement. At least 4/6 stanzas have (2,4) rhyme. So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Final stanza echoes opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases or clear refrain. The final stanza uses \"beamish boy\", \"frabjous day\", \"chortled in his joy,\" which appear in canonical poem but not opening stanza here, and the final stanza includes the phrase 'He chortled in his joy.' No direct repetition of opening stanza content words. So no ring echo.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early warning/admonition: First stanza begins with “Beware the fishtail gouge, my chum!”, which is a clear admonition to the protagonist. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: The second stanza depicts the protagonist taking an ‘awlbird grip’, resting by the workbench, and standing in thought, which indicates preparation before encounter. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: Later lines depict “One, two! One, two! The handle spun,” “The sweep went snicker-snack!”, the blade action implying a meeting or confrontation. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: The “sweep went snicker-snack!” and handle spinning imply a decisive cutting action. The phrasing 'And hast thou slain the fishtail foe?' in final stanza implies result of decisive action. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: The last stanza contains celebration-like language: “O frabjous day,” “come carve in carroty joy,” “He chortled in his joy.” This fits return and celebration. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: Count distinct invented coinages excluding canonical ones. Non-canonical coinages include: fishtail gouge, awlbird, manxsome (variant of manxome), raspish, tick-a-tock (partially onomatopoeic), sap-snap, curl’s inquisitive face (curl likely not a coinage), chisel-chap, carroty joy. Approximately 7 coinages clearly novel (awlbird, fishtail gouge, raspish, sap-snap, chisel-chap, carroty, tick-a-tock) which is just under 8. So no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: most stanzas have at least one coinage: stanzas 1 (fishtail gouge), 2 (awlbird, manxsome, raspish, tick-a-tock, sap-snap), 3 (handle spun?), 4 (snicker-snack canonical), 5 (?), 6 (chisel-chap, carroty). Overall likely ≥1 coinage per stanza. Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: The named adversary is “fishtail gouge” (technically an entity/obstacle), but it is an object/tool-like foe, not a creature per se. Also \"awlbird grip\" and “manxsome stock” mentioned but “manxsome” is canonical (manxome), “awlbird” is coinage but not named as creature. The foe is the ‘fishtail gouge’, so yes, a named non-canonical entity central to action. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: The poem uses “snicker-snack” (canonical), “tick-a-tock”, “sap-snap” - these count as onomatopoeic bursts. At least two distinct onomatopoeic bursts present. Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Phrases like “blade that flirts, the edge that snips”, “snicker-snack of steel”, “whirl and twirl your thumbs”, “ raspish rasp”, “tick-a-tock”, “sap-snap’s leafy gasp” show clear alliteration and consonance across multiple stanzas. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The poem follows canonical arc: warning (stanza 1), preparation (stanza 2), encounter (stanza 4), decisive action (stanza 4), return/celebration (final stanza). Overall matches canonical order. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: The only line exactly matching canonical poem is “One, two! One, two! … snicker-snack!” which also appears in canonical poem, so fails here. Hence no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Canonical tokens present are “manxsome” (variant of manxome), “snicker-snack”, “beamish boy”, “frabjous day”, “chortled in his joy”. These count under 8 distinct canonical tokens. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines mostly around 8-9 syllables (“Beware the fishtail gouge, my chum!” (8), “The blade that flirts, the edge that snips!” (8), shorter lines around 5-7 syllables. Consistent with Jabberwocky pattern in most quatrains. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The (2,4) rhyme pairs vary well across stanzas, no end word repeated more than twice (excluding ring echo which is absent). Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is repeated excessively. Words like “joy” occur 2-3 times, acceptable. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages include awlbird, raspish, tick-a-tock, sap-snap, chisel-chap, carroty, fishtail gouge (root fishtail, awlbird, rasp, tick, sap, chisel, carroty). At least 4 distinct roots without dominance by one suffix. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a confrontation with the \"fishtail gouge\"—an analog to Jabberwock but with different imagery. Topic adherence is strong (the named foe, encounter, and resolution). Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond surface action of carving/tool fight, there is implied motif about craftsmanship, struggle, and mastery, coherent throughout poem.
