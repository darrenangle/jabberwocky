{"i": 1, "prompt": "Write a poem in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Your prompt is \"hollow grind on an O1 blade\". Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "Hollow Grind on an O1 Blade\n\n'Twas twilight, and the O1 blade\nDid grind and hone with care,\nAll smooth and sharp, a hollow ground\nWith edges strong and fair.\n\n\"Beware the dullness, sharpness seeker!\nThe tear and tug, and pull-out snicker!\nBeware the Knots, and shun\nThe chip and nick, that mauls!\"\n\nHe took his blade in hand:\nLong time the whetstone he sought--\nSo rested he by the stone,\nAnd honed it as he thought.\n\nAnd, as in honing thought he stood,\nThe O1 blade, in hand he shook!\nOne, two!

Callooh! Callay!\"\nHe chortled in his joy.\n\n'Twas twilight, and the O1 blade\nDid grind and hone with care,\nAll smooth and sharp, a hollow ground\nWith edges strong and fair.", "info": {}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>Title \"Hollow Grind on an O1 Blade\" is present before the first stanza and non-empty.</C1_think>\n<C2_think>Counting stanzas: There are 8 stanzas, but many are not quatrains. Last line before ring echo stanza is 3 lines, other stanzas have irregular line counts. At least one stanza with fewer than 4 lines (e.g., stanza 5 has 3 lines). So not all stanzas are quatrains; total stanzas count ok but shape fails.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter with alternating line lengths: Lines do not consistently alternate longer/shorter by ≥2 content words in ≥60% stanzas. The metrical rhythm is quite irregular and seems mostly prose-like in many stanzas.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme: Several stanzas end with rhyme (2,4) pairs (\"mauls\"/\"snicker\" slant, \"shun\"/\"mauls\" not really rhyming well). The dominant rhyme appears as AABB partially ((lines 1 and 2 sometimes rhyme), and limited clear rhymes. The poem partially rhymes but dominance of AABB or weak rhyme suggests no clear ballad rhyme scheme adhering to original style.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza repeats the first stanza verbatim in content words, phrases, and structure (the opening stanza repeated at the end). This strongly confirms ring composition with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition is present early: stanza 2 contains \"Beware the dullness, sharpness seeker!\" and warnings to avoid defects (\"chip and nick\") matching admonition style.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation and armament: The protagonist takes the blade in hand, searches for whetstone, rests and hones it before encounter, consistent with preparation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: The poem describes the blade shaking in hand and the \"stone went snicker-snack!\", implying an encounter with dullness or sharpening process, so there is a clear confrontation metaphor.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: The phrase \"One, two! One, two! And through and through / The stone went snicker-snack!\" echoes the slaying act; \"He left it dead, and with its head / He went galumphing back.\" implying decisive victory over dullness or imperfection.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: The poem includes a jubilant acknowledgment \"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\", and \"He chortled in his joy.\", so return/celebration beat is present.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: Coinages like \"snicker-snack\" and \"galumphing\" are canonical. New coinages involve \"snicker-snack\" and \"galumphing\" (canonical), and \"pull-out snicker\" is not coinage, \"mauls\" is standard English, \"whisker\" absent, so fewer than 8 distinct invented coinages overall.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Spread of coinages: Canonical coinages appear in some stanzas (e.g., stanza 5 and ring echo), but many stanzas lack any invented coinage beyond standard English words. Not every stanza contains a coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: The poem centralizes the \"O1 blade,\" an object, not a creature or entity, named, aside from canonical \"Jabberwocky\" coinages omitted. No noncanonical creature/entity analogous to Jubjub or Bandersnatch is named.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"snicker-snack\" appears which is canonical onomatopoeia, repeated once. Possibly only one distinct onomatopoeic burst, no additional distinct onomatopoeic bursts like \"Pop!\" or \"Hiss!\".</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: The poem has some incidental alliteration (\"grind and hone,\" \"sharpness seeker,\" \"pull-out snicker\") but no strong within-line alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas clearly beyond incidental level.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order is mostly canonical: warning, preparation, encounter, slaying, return in that order, roughly intact.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: Lines such as \"'Twas twilight, and the O1 blade / Did grind and hone with care,\" are not verbatim from original; few canonical phrases reused but no line exactly matches canonical poem normalized. \"One, two! One, two! And through and through / The stone went snicker-snack!\" echoes canonical lines but changes words; no exact line matches.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token budget: canonical tokens like \"snicker-snack\", \"galumphing\", \"beamish\", and \"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\" repeated, but total distinct canonical tokens fewer than 8.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts: Longer lines are often 7–9 syllables, shorter lines often 5–7, roughly matching Jabberwocky meter though several lines may be shorter or less rhythmic; meter is not tightly matched in all stanzas.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhyme pairs (2,4) vary. There is some repetition of rhyme words (\"care\" in stanza 1 and stanza 8), but no word reused >2 times apart from ring echo. Rhyme variety acceptable.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No content word is overused; standard English words dominate besides some repeated key content words like \"blade\", no word exceeds usage limits.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Few coinages; main coinage is \"snicker-snack\" and canonical ones; no diverse new roots or suffixes; thus, variety of coinages is low.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Topic clearly addressed is blade sharpening and fighting dullness, matching a similar theme to the original creature battle but adapted to a blade. Topic is consistent.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Implied metaphor of combating dullness and imperfection, craft and mastery, present across the poem, providing a coherent undertone.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.5833333333333334, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 0.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 0.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.5833333333333334, "criteria_yes": 14, "label": "medium"}

So not all stanzas have 4 lines; total stanza count about 7, but not all quatrains. Thus no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter: Check alternating long/short lines with ≥2 content-word difference in ≥60% of stanzas. The lines do not clearly alternate long/short with expected strong pattern typical of ballad meter. More prose-like lines and irregular lengths. Thus no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme: Check stanzas for (2,4) rhyme with slant rhyme allowed, avoiding AABB dominance. Rhyme in 2nd stanza lines 2 and 4 absent or weak; subsequent stanzas have occasional rhyme but inconsistent. Probably less than 60% stanza compliance. Thus no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Final stanza echoes first stanza with at least 2 repeated content words or clear refrain. Final stanza repeats \"'Twas brillig\" phrase twice and \"printshop\" which mirrors opening. Ring echo is present.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition: There is a warning \"Beware the Slug, my son! ... shun!\" early on, like canonical form. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: Protagonist takes a \"Bodkin\" in hand, long time the foe he sought, rested by Tympan tree, stood in thought. This implies preparation and waiting before encounter. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: The \"Slug\" with eyes of flame comes whiffling through type trays; clear meeting of protagonist and adversary. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying decisive action: \"The Bodkin went snicker-snack! He left it dead...\" clear decisive killing action resolving tension. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: He \"strode, galumphing, to his printshop on the hill\" then \"he declared with joy and pride\" and others \"chortle\", \"they sang\". Celebration present. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: Distinct invented coinages excluding canonical and known English. Examples: glandered, Eyer, jaws thatichten, Tympan, type-high, lock-up chase, calleped pneum, brillibg (typo?), turtle (standard English). Approaching but fewer than 8 distinct clear non-canonical coinages. Mix of standard English and some new terms, but counting cautiously, maybe 6-7. Borderline, so no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Does each stanza contain at least one coinage? Some stanzas contain canonical or known words, e.g. stanza 1 mostly standard with \"quoin keys\" (maybe uncommon specialist word), stanza 2 has \"glander\" and \"Eyer\" coinages. Stanza 7 has \"calleped pneum\" (unclear coinage), \"printshop\" is standard. Some stanzas lack clear coinages. Not each stanza contains a coinage. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: A non-canonical creature/entity named central to action, other than Jabberwock. The \"Slug\" is named and fights protagonist, central adversary. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: The poem uses \"snicker-snack!\" canonical line; also \"clatter and chitter\", \"burbled\" (canonical), but not at least 2 clear onomatopoeic bursts beyond canonical. \"Snicker-snack\" is canonical. Need at least 2 non-canonical or total ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts. Only \"snicker-snack\" is directly onomatopoeic; \"clatter and chitter\" possibly. Counting canonical \"burbled\" as canonical. Better to interpret only 1-2 bursts, with 1 canonical. Borderline, so no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Multiple stanzas show alliteration: \"clatter and chitter\", \"Bodkin... beast...\", \"burbled as it came\", \"printshop's turtle\". At least 2 stanzas have clear strong alliteration beyond incidental.

The poem uses canonical \"brillig\", \"mimsy\", \"mome\", \"uffish\", \"whiffling\", \"burbled\", \"snicker-snack\", \"galumphing\", \"beamish\" ? Some appear in poem, e.g. \"burbled\", \"snicker-snack\", \"galumphing\", \"brillig\", \"uffish\", \"mome\". At least 9 distinct canonical tokens likely above limit of 8. So no.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines ≈8-9 syllables, shorter lines 5-7 syllables in every stanza. Lines are mostly longer with irregular syllable counts. Some stanzas have lines with more than 9 syllables and some lines near or below 5 syllables. Not tightly controlled. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme endings repeated less or equal than twice (excluding ring echo). Rhyme poorly varied; some rhymes repeated, e.g. shun/un and arrays/tricks is non-rhyming. No strong variety.

So 5 quatrains total, within 5-8 range, all quatrains of 4 lines. Yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter check: Looking for alternating longer/shorter lines within stanzas with ≥2 content-word difference. The lines mostly seem to have 8-9 syllables; some lines are shorter but the alternation pattern is not clearly consistent or evident in ≥60% stanzas. Likely 'no' because strict alternation is unclear.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme assessment: Mostly weak or partial rhyme. For example, stanza 2 lines 2 and 4 end with \"tags\" / \"sigh\" - no rhyme; stanza 4 lines 2 and 4 end \"divine\" / \"flame\" - no rhyme. Overall rhyme is limited or absent on lines 2,4 in many stanzas. So rhyme that matches Jabberwocky ballad rhyme pattern is not met.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Last stanza does not echo the first by repeating content words or refrains clearly. No visible refrain or repeated lines from opening stanza. No ring echo.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>No early admonition or warning is present in the first or second stanzas, no cautionary statement like \"Beware\" or equivalent.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>No clear preparation or armament before any encounter; the poem is about farewells, no protagonist readying for battle or challenge.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>No clear encounter or confrontation. The poem describes farewell on a platform and departure, no adversarial meeting or obstacle confronted.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>No decisive violent or central conflict-resolving action; no slaying or similar climactic event.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>No return or celebration or homecoming; theme is departure and sadness.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Uncommon words: \"Whifflepox,\" \"woítulo,\" \"lubbertrain,\" \"djub,\" \"Mallenia,\" \"Snurlit,\" \"tileless,\" \"dup,\" and possibly \"gloaming\" (but that is standard poetic). At least 8 distinct invented coinages are present.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinages in every stanza? Yes, each stanza has ≥1 invented word: First stanza \"Whifflepox,\" \"wuggle\"; second stanza \"thejubjub\" (poor spacing?), \"tags\"; third stanza \"Burbling\" (unclear if coinage), \"dup,\" \"dash(?),\" \"Mallenia\" (maybe proper name invented), \"farewells\" is English; fourth stanza \"quadrilled,\" \"Snurlit,\" \"Sor 땀,\"; fifth stanza \"woítulo,\" \"djub,\" \"lubbertrain,\" \"tileless.\" Most stanzas have ≥1 coinage, yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>No named creature/entity other than \"thejubjub bird's sad tags\" (possibly \"jubjub\" is canonical but here compounded as \"thejubjub\"). No clear new creature named and central to action. The creature isn't central; it's a remark in line 6 not focal in narrative.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts? Limited or none obviously; possibly \"toot\" in line 17 is an onomatopoeic burst, but only one clear instance. No other bursting sound words like \"snicker-snack\" or \"burbled\" clearly present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration or consonance: Some potential — e.g., \"Farewell's bitter chill did whim,\" \"Burbling aisles did dup and dash,\" \"wilful whispers\" — at least 2 stanzas show noticeable alliteration/consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: canonical arc is warning → preparation → encounter → decisive action → return/celebration. This poem shows none of warning, preparation, encounter, or decisive action — it has only a farewell and departure. So arc beats are not present in canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines from the canonical poem verbatim. Though some canonical words appear (\"’Twas brillig,\" \"mome,\" \"wabe\"), no entire lines directly match canonical lines exactly when normalized. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token budget ≤8: Uses \"brillig,\" \"mome,\" \"wabe,\" \"slithy\" (?), \"jubjub\" (used only inside a compound?), \"beamish\" is absent. At most around 5-6 canonical tokens are visible. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines mostly ~8-9 syllables, shorter lines somewhat shorter but often lines appear of similar length, no clear alternating ~8/6 syllables pattern. Not consistently met in all quatrains. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhymes on lines (2,4) weak and sparse, and where rhyme occurs it mainly uses similar endings repeatedly. Variety is low. No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No obvious overuse of any content word. Distribution is mixed.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages appear to have multiple different roots; at least 4 distinct root forms noted. No suffix dominates >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem is a farewell scene on a train platform, which is quite different from Jabberwocky themes of monster-slaying. Topic is different or substituted. No.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Some coherent implied undertone of loss and departure is detectable throughout. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>no</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>no</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.4166666666666667, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 0.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 0.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 1.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.4166666666666667, "criteria_yes": 10, "label": "low"}

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "Opal's Play-of-Color Flash\n\nIn dungeons deep where opals hide,\nA realm of hues, a burst of light,\nBeneath the earth, a wonderous sight,\nWhere opal's play-of-color flash.\n\n'Twas brillig, and the slithy tomes\nDid search for hidden treasures' homes,\nAll mimsy were the cavern flumes,\nAs gem-hounds sought the opal's flash.\n\n\"Take care,\" they cried, \"the light may blind\nYour eyes, when opal's flash you find!\"\nWith vorpal picks, a path they mined,\nEager for the opal's flash.\n\nAnd as they delved, a glint, a gleam,\nA spindly beam of spectral stream,\nA spectral shimmer, fiery and supreme,\nBewitched by the opal's flash.\n\nThrough groves of gemstones, quartz, and shale,\nTheir lanterns dim, their spirits pale,\nSearch for the opal, fiery and frumious, never fail,\nFor the allure of the opal's flash.\n\nQuickly now, with snicker-snack,\nReveal the gems, fill up the sack,\nThe treasure hoard upon their back,\nA trove aglow with opal's flash.\n\n\"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\"\nThey chortled in their joyous fray,\n\"Hail the marvels we display,\nThe spoils of opal's flash!\"\n\n'Twas brillig, deep in caverns vast,\nThe play of hues, a light cast,\nFor opal's enchanting spell was cast,\nIn the dungeons where opals flash.", "info": {}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>Title present as a non-empty line before stanzas: \"Opal's Play-of-Color Flash\" present clearly before first stanza.</C1_think>\n<C2_think>Count stanzas: 9 stanzas. All are quatrains (4 lines). 9 exceeds max allowed 8. So fails stanza count range criterion.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter: Jabberwocky pattern is alternating longer (~8–9) and shorter (~5–7) lines with ≥2 content-word difference in ≥60% stanzas. Here, many stanzas do not show clear alternating long-short pattern; lines are often similar length or all roughly equal. Less than 60% stanzas meet that ballad meter echo criterion.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme: Lines 2 and 4 rhyme or slant rhyme in many stanzas (flash/home, bl...gleam/stream, sack/flash, fray/display). However, \"flash\" as end word is repeated very often (multiple stanzas end with \"opal's flash\"), making rhyme repetitive and approaching AABB feel in some stanzas. Rhyme pattern generally 2/4, but reliance on \"flash\" repeated end rhyme too often suggests borderline on variety and AABB dominance avoidance.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>No ring composition: The last stanza repeats \"opal's flash\" but no clear echo of opening stanza lines or repeated phrases beyond repeated \"opal's flash\" phrase. The ring echo requires at least 2 repeated content words or a clear refrain evoking opening stanza. Only repeated phrase is \"opal's flash\", insufficient for strong ring echo.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>No explicit early admonition or caution phrase with direct warning like “Beware …” or equivalent. There's a \"Take care,\" but no direct admonition or warning with dread or fear tone at start.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: The protagonist(s) \"with vorpal picks, a path they mined,\" shows clear preparation/arming before encounter (searching/digging for opal with tools and effort). So yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: Rather indirect; no antagonist creature named or fought, but jewels/spectral gleams are sought. There's \"As they delved, a glint, a gleam,\" but no clash or meeting with living adversary. This is borderline but no clear adversarial encounter.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive act: No mention of slaying or defeating creature/foe. The decisive action is \"Quickly now, with snicker-snack, reveal the gems, fill up the sack,\" i.e., collecting treasure—this is an action resolving quest tension, so arguably yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Clear jubilant acknowledgment in stanza with “O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! They chortled in their joyous fray,” celebration is explicit.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Invented words distinct from canonical and standard English. Coinages: \"play-of-color,\" \"brillig\" (canonical), \"slithy\" (canonical), \"tomes\" (standard English), \"mimsy\" (canonical), \"flumes\" (English), \"gem-hounds\" (invented compound), \"frumious\" (canonical coinage), \"snicker-snack\" (canonical), \"frabjous\" (canonical), \"chortled\" (canonical), \"spectral stream\" (spectral not coined), \"trove aglow\" (standard English). Coinages outside canonical are sparse - \"gem-hounds\" and \"play-of-color\" compound stands out, but fewer than 8 distinct invented coinages overall, especially when canonical, English or rare compounds included.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Not all stanzas have coinages distinct from canonical/English. Several stanzas rely on canonical or English words mostly. So no: coinage per stanza not met.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>No non-canonical creature/entity named central to action - \"gem-hounds\" mentioned but these feel more figurative or compound than named creature akin to Jabberwock. No clear central adversarial creature named.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"snicker-snack\" is present (canonical), but second onomatopoeic burst missing or ambiguous; no \"Pop!\", \"Hiss!\", or similarly vivid sound bursts detected. Only one onomatopoeic term.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Only weak or incidental alliteration detected, e.g. \"play-of-color\" and \"chortled in joyous fray\" has minimal alliteration. No clear strong alliteration beyond incidental repetition in ≥2 stanzas. Likely no.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The arc beats of warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration do not appear strictly in order. Warning is absent, encounter is vague, preparation mid-poem, then collection (decisive) and celebration. Order incomplete or partially broken.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines present, except \"’Twas brillig,\" and \"snicker-snack\" which are canonical coinages but lines themselves not exact match; no lines exactly matching canonical lines verbatim found. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Canonical tokens used include brillig, slithy, mimsy, frumious, vorpal, snicker-snack, frabjous, chortled. That's 8 canonical tokens. No more than 8 canonical tokens used. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines roughly 8–9 syllables, shorter lines 5–7. Many lines have 8–9 syllables, but shorter lines often longer than 7 or close to 8 syllables, losing tight rhythmic alternation. Thus no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: End rhyme word \"flash\" is repeated excessively (>2 times) across many stanzas, limiting rhyme variety and violating requirement against repeated rhyme word >2 times excluding ring echo. So no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: \"opal's flash\" repeated as phrase many times, \"opal's\" as a content word clearly overused beyond allowed limit outside ring echo context. Lexical overuse fails this.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages present are largely derivations from \"opal,\" \"flash,\" or compounds with obvious roots; fewer than 4 distinct roots among coinages. Dominated by \"opal\" root. So no.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly addresses \"opal\" theme as central motif consistently: opals, gem hunting, spectral flash. Topic adherence yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond surface action of gem seeking, no deeper coherent implied motif or undertone detected; mostly literal. Subtext unclear.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>no</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>no</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.2916666666666667, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 0.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 0.0, "C16_arc_order": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 0.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 0.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 0.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 1.0}, "reward": 0.2916666666666667, "criteria_yes": 7, "label": "very_low"}

There are stanzas of varying line counts, e.g. stanza 3 has 4 lines but stanza 6 and 7 have 4 lines; stanza 4 and 5 have 4 lines. Actually, all stanzas appear to be 4 lines. Counting lines per stanza: 7 stanzas, each 4 lines, thus 7 quatrains, which fits 5-8 inclusive.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter echo: Check line pairs in stanzas for alternating long/short lines with ≥2 content-word difference. On cursory check, the meter is a bit inconsistent, but most stanzas mostly alternate longer and shorter lines (e.g., 4/7/5/7 or similar) so likely ≥60% stanzas meet this alternation, judging roughly.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme: In most stanzas, lines 2 and 4 rhyme or slant rhyme (e.g. \"play\"/\"snare\", \"emfark\"/\"rose\"). The rhyme scheme is largely ABAB or ABCB, not AABB dominant. At least 5 of 7 stanzas have (2,4) rhyme.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Final stanza repeats \"Beware\" warning and references throttlewumps again; however, final stanza does not echo the exact wording or content words of the first stanza besides the 'Beware'. The first stanza is about brillig on lawn and peony ants; final stanza returns focus to the threat (throttlewumps) and peony ants but little exact repeat. Less than two repeated content words or clear refrain between first and last stanza, so likely no ring echo.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition: Second stanza is a warning \"Beware the throttlewumps that play... Lest in their sweetness thou be lost\", fulfilling admonition criterion early in poem.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: Third stanza describes protagonist taking suctionspoon in hand and fighting for a goal, indicating preparation and action before encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: Third stanza contains \"He fought the snizzlejaws and whimsy wings,\" indicating a clear confrontation with adversaries other than canonical creatures.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: The protagonist \"conquered the fortress of the auroral kings,\" a decisive overcoming of the central obstacle.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Fourth stanza describes dancing/flazles spinning and peony ants watching vigil. There's no clear jubilant homecoming or celebration focused on protagonist or quest victory.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Distinct coinages: Notable invented words include throttlewumps, suctionspoon, snizzlejaws, whimsy wings, flazles, frumplenooks, glymphs, fluumbels, florilege, gloam. At least 9 distinct coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza appears to contain at least one coined word (e.g. stanza 2 \"throttlewumps\"; stanza 3 \"suctionspoon\", \"snizzlejaws\"; stanza 4 \"flazles\", \"frumplenooks\"; stanza 5 \"glymphs\", \"fluumbels\", \"florilege\"; stanza 7 \"throttlewumps\", \"gloam\"). So yes, ≥1 coinage per stanza.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: Named non-canonical creatures: throttlewumps, snizzlejaws, flazles, frumplenooks - these are central to action or setting, so yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: No clear onomatopoeic bursts (like snicker-snack, Pop!, Hiss!) present; no onomatopoeic words distinctive in text.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Some alliteration present but no very strong or clear within-line alliteration prominently in ≥2 stanzas (e.g. \"Whispers wove a mystic spell\" shows some but not strong repeated alliteration within line; \"flazles danced and frumplenooks spun\" slight, but not strong evidence. Borderline no.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning (stanza 2), preparation (stanza 3), encounter (stanza 3), decisive action (stanza 3 - conquering), return/celebration (stanzas 4-7 describe aftermath and vigilance).

Overall: yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: No exact match of canonical lines or phrases is present after normalization.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: The poem uses “brillig” and “Beware,” and “beamish” not used; canonical tokens present minimal, ≤8.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines mostly near 8-9 syllables, shorter lines near 5-7 syllables, consistent with Jabberwocky style.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhyme endings seem varied; no end word (2,4 position) repeats more than twice except slight repeat of 'play' and 'embark'/‘rose’ don't fit rhyme strictly. Variety acceptable.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No content word is overused >5 times or >8% of content words noticeably; repetitions are thematic but diversified.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages include throttlewumps, suctionspoon, snizzlejaws, whimsy wings, flazles, frumplenooks, glymphs, fluumbels, florilege, gloam, reproductive throes (latter a phrase). At least 4 distinct roots; no single suffix dominates.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem addresses a Jabberwocky-style nonsense creature battle and quest clearly, no clear topic drift.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem retains a mysterious, possibly allegorical undertone about vigilance and struggle against hidden dangers, implying motifs of persistence through natural cycles.

stanza count within 5–8; all quatrains.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter analysis: The poem does not clearly exhibit the distinctive longer/shorter line alternation with ≥2 content words difference typical in Jabberwocky in most stanzas; many lines are more uniform in length and content word count.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme: In several stanzas the (2,4) lines rhyme or slant rhyme (e.g., \"chatter/shim\", \"scowls/struggles\" - less clear rhyme), but consistency is low and AABB pattern is dominant in multiple stanzas; not clearly meeting 60% with correct rhyme and avoiding AABB dominance.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Final stanza echoes opening stanza wording (’Twas brillig’, ‘all mimsy’, ‘linoleum’ replacing ‘slithy toves’), and repeats several content words like “brillig”, “linoleum”, “studio”, “mimsy”, “brayers”—more than two repeated content words/phrases; clear refrain-like echo.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present: Second stanza explicitly warns “Be sure your tools are sharp, my friend!” and cautions about “linocut brayer’s chatter” cutting and dicing, similar to \"Beware ...\" admonition.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: Stanzas 3 and 5 show protagonist resting, studying, practicing cuts, warming up hands, steadying nerves before decisive cutting; clear preparation phase before confrontation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: The confrontation is somewhat abstract, centered on the cutting process and tool use; stanza 6 describes blade going “snicker-snack” and chips flying — a clear engagement between artist (protagonist) and linoleum block (adversary/obstacle).</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: The decisive act seems to be the completion of the cut, the blade going snicker-snack, chips flying, block nearly done — parallels the slaying of Jabberwock; this is a decisive resolution of tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Poem ends with return to quiet studio state and pleased hands; last stanzas show calm and drying ink blocks, and a light celebratory tone with \"linocut brayer's chatter's won!\", and farewell tone similar to return.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Invented coinages or nonce words include “linoleum” (not invented), “brayers” (real word), “Ternesko” (invented?), “shim” (real English word), “jabbering” (from Jabberwock but altered), “heartsong’s” (compound, borderline), “gumption” (English), “scowls” etc. Need at least 8 distinct, non-standard or invented coined words: “Ternesko” is new; “brayer's chatter” as a phrase is original coinage; but not eight clear invented coinages in total — many standard English or canonical lexicon from Jabberwocky missing.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage or unusual phrase: “linoleum,” “Ternesko,” “jabbering,” “heartsong’s,” “snicker-snack” (canonical), so at least 1 coined word per stanza is present.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>No non-canonical creature/entity named: “linocut brayer” is tool/personification, not a named creature or adversary; no new named creature analogous to “Jabberwock.” Fails on this point.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: “snicker-snack” (canonical) used once; no second onomatopoeia bursts like \"Pop!\" or \"Hiss!\" or similar distinct sounds appear.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Some alliteration present (“tools are sharp”, “slice and dice”, “mind travails and tolls”) but not strongly beyond incidental; 2 stanzas show clear alliteration but not very prominent.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning (stanza 2), preparation (stanzas 3 and 5), encounter (6), decisive action (6), return/celebration (7–8); the sequence flows logically in canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim lines: The poem repeats \"’Twas brillig\" opening line verbatim and \"All mimsy were the...\" from canonical poem; identical lines present verbatim from canonical poem prevent a 'yes' here.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token budget: Uses several canonical tokens (’Twas brillig’, mimsy, snicker-snack, gyre, gimble in first stanza + last), so canonical tokens count likely >8 — fails canonical budget criterion.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Lines are somewhat irregular; longer lines exceed 9 syllables often; shorter lines sometimes exceed 7; pattern does not closely replicate Jabberwocky’s ~8/6 pattern in all stanzas.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) end rhymes tend to repeat similar sounds (chatter/shim, scowls/struggles, begun/won, etc.) with little variety and some repeated exact endings; no strong variety.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No overuse of any single content word above 5 times or 8% of content words; repetition moderate and acceptable.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages mainly come from a small set (e.g., “linocut,” “brayer,” “jabbering,” “snicker-snack”, “heartsong”), roots fewer than 4 distinct; suffix few and not spread; overall insufficient coinage variety.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem addresses a carved linoleum block and the linocut brayer, fitting a spoof of Jabberwocky style applied to printmaking tools; topic adherence to original Jabberwocky theme adapted well.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Implied subtext about artistic struggle, creativity, perseverance underlying armament and battle metaphor is coherent and sustained throughout.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.5833333333333334, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 0.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 0.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.5833333333333334, "criteria_yes": 14, "label": "medium"}

So yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>There is an encounter/confrontation: \"A gear began to falter... The blued screw... Knew its time had come... Mending the movement\"—a clear meeting of problem and protagonist. So yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>There is a decisive action resolving tension: the blued screw \"mending the movement's past\" and the clock resumes rhythm, so yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return or celebration? The poem ends with \"And though it seemed insignificant, It was the movement's saving grace\" and an encouraging \"Remember... your time will come.\" Not a clear jubilant homecoming or celebration, but a positive resolution and implicit acknowledgment. Borderline but not overt celebration. No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: \"blued screw\", \"ticking tome\", \"movement\" are all standard English or familiar constructs; no invented coined words like Carroll's style. No clear or distinct invented coinages ≥8. So no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>No coinages in every stanza found, since no coinages spotted much at all. So no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>The named creature/entity is \"blued screw,\" which is not canonical, nor a creature in the Jabberwock sense—it is an object and central to action. The criterion asks for a non-canonical creature/entity named and central to action, not \"Jabberwock.\" The \"blued screw\" fits that. So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>No onomatopoeic bursts like \"snicker-snack,\" \"hiss,\" \"pop\" found. So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>No evidence of notable alliteration or consonance in ≥2 stanzas beyond incidental repeats. So no.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>The arc ordered as warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration. Here warning is missing, preparation then encounter then action, but no return/celebration phase. So the canonical arc is broken. No.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines identical to the canonical poem found. Lines are original. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexicon tokens ≤8? The poem uses none of Carroll's canonical lexicon (brillig, slithy, toves, etc.). So equals zero canonical tokens, meeting criterion favoring new coinages. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count in quatrain stanzas: lines have variable syllable counts, irregular meter, no clear ~8/6 alternation, and many stanzas are not strict quatrains. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety moot because not much rhyme present. Without enough rhymes, can't confirm no overuse. So no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: no significant overuse (>5 times or >8%) of single content word, no dominant repeated token outside ring echo. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages are absent or minimal, so no variety of coinage roots. So no.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem is not about Jabberwock or similar topic. It's about a \"blued screw\" in a clock movement. The topic is not the Jabberwock theme and subverts to an object story. So no.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext implied: the poem is a metaphor about purpose and waiting, significance of small roles, implying wider motif about meaning and patience. Coherent undertone is detectable.

Line counts per stanza: most have 4 lines except first stanza which has 5 lines (lines: 4 in second stanza, 4 in third, 4 in fourth, etc.). First stanza is 5 lines, so not all stanzas are quatrains; total stanza count is within 5-8. So \"no\" because not all stanzas have exactly 4 lines.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter inspection: Jabberwocky typically alternates longer (~8-9 syll) lines with shorter (~5-7) lines in each stanza. Here, it is mixed. Some stanzas roughly follow alternating line length, but in first stanza lines are not balanced and last stanza line count shorter. Checking about 60% stanzas fitting alternating longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content words difference is borderline; first stanza has 5 lines which breaks pattern. Overall, borderline but leans 'no'.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme mostly (2,4) rhyme present: example stanza 2 has: \"hand\" / \"thought\" no rhyme; stanza 3 (uffish...), stanza 4 (\"snicker-snack\"/\"back\") rhyme present; stanza 5 (\"joy\" / \"boy\") rhyme; stanzas 1 and 2 do not have clear rhyme (1st stanza lines 2 and 4: \"lay\" and \"son!\" no rhyme; 2nd stanza no rhyme). So fewer than 60% stanzas with (2,4) rhyme; also no sign of monotony like AABB dominance. So \"no\".</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words or refrain? Final stanza repeats \"’Twas brillig on the workshop floor,\" and \"Where tools and sawdust lay.\" from first stanza, matching almost verbatim. This is a strong ring composition echo with repeated content words/phrases, so yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition: Yes, stanza 1 lines 3-5 include \"Beware the Fishtail Gouge, my son! / The jaws that bite, the blades that catch! / Beware the Sweep, and shun / The tail that trails from its back!\" which is an admonition to the protagonist, so yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: Stanza 2 details protagonist \"He took his Dovetail Saw in hand\" and \"Long time the chip-fount rills he sought— / So rested he by the Lathe-wood tree / And stood a while in thought.\" Shows preparation and resolve, so yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: Stanza 4 mentions \"The Fishtail Gouge, with eyes of flame, / Came whiffling through the sawdusty wood / And wove its tail in loops of grain!\" clearly a meeting with the adversary; so yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: Stanza 5 \"One, two! One, two! And through and through / The Dovetail blade went snicker-snack! / He left it dead, and with its head / He went galumphing back.\" clear decisive action resolving central tension; yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Stanza 6 \"“And hast thou slain the Fishtail Gouge? / Come to my arms, my beamish boy! / O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!” / He chortled in his joy.\" shows jubilant return; yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Distinct invented coinages: \"Fishtail Gouge,\" \"Sweep,\" \"Dovetail Saw,\" \"chip-fount rills,\" \"Lathe-wood,\" \"sawdusty wood,\" possibly \"wove its tail in loops of grain\" implying creative language; coinages definitely beyond canonical lexicon, but at least 8 distinct coined terms? \"Fishtail,\" \"Gouge,\" \"Sweep,\" \"chip-fount,\" \"rills,\" \"Lathe-wood,\" \"sawdusty,\" \"Dovetail,\" \"whiffling,\" \"snicker-snack,\" \"galumphing,\" \"beamish\" counts some canonical. Total probably fewer than 8 new coinages alone, because some terms are standard English compound words or canonical. Coinages identified: \"Fishtail Gouge,\" \"Sweep,\" \"chip-fount,\" \"Lathe-wood,\" some are compound words with standard parts but coined for effect. Counting strong coinages as distinct: \"Fishtail Gouge,\" \"Sweep,\" \"chip-fount,\" \"Lathe-wood,\" \"sawdusty\" (common), \"dovetail\" is standard woodworking term; \"snicker-snack,\" \"galumphing,\" \"beamish\" canonical. So approximately 4-5 coinages, below the threshold 8; thus no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage presence per stanza: Stanza 1: \"Fishtail Gouge,\" \"Sweep\"; stanza 2: \"Dovetail Saw,\" \"chip-fount rills,\" \"Lathe-wood\"; stanza 4: \"whiffling,\" \"sawdusty\"; stanza 5: \"snicker-snack,\" \"Dovetail blade\"; stanza 6: \"beamish,\" \"frabjous,\" \"Callooh! Callay!.\" Coinages are present in most stanzas but not all (3rd stanza no coinage visible); so no, because coinage not in every stanza.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central to action (not 'Jabberwock'): The \"Fishtail Gouge\" is named and central adversary, plus the \"Sweep.\" Both are non-canonical creatures/entities standing for adversaries. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts: \"snicker-snack!\" is used; \"whiffling\" is more sound evocative but may not count as burst; \"wove its tail in loops of grain\" no onomatopoeia; no additional bursts like \"Pop!\" or \"Hiss!\" seen. Only one clear onomatopoeic burst: \"snicker-snack!\". So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Examples of alliteration include \"Fishtail Gouge\" (F), \"Dovetail blade\" (D), \"chip-fount rills\" (hard ch), \"stood a while in thought\" (th alliteration), \"beamish boy\" (b alliteration). At least two stanzas with clear alliteration or consonance: stanza 2 (\"chip-fount rills,\" \"Lathe-wood,\" \"stood a while in thought\") and stanza 6 (\"beamish boy,\" \"frabjous day\"), so yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning (\"Beware...\") in stanza 1; Preparation (taking saw, resting in thought) stanza 2; Encounter stanza 4; Decisive action stanza 5; Return and celebration stanza 6. Arc order is canonical and in correct sequence. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: Some lines nearly match canonical poem lines such as \"One, two! One, two! And through and through / The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!\" but model uses \"Dovetail blade,\" \"Fishtail Gouge,\" \"sawdusty wood,\" \"chip-fount rills,\" which are changed. However, the line \"And, as in uffish thought he stood,\" is exact verbatim from canonical poem (line 4 stanza 3). This exact line appears identically in stanza 3 of model poem. Thus no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token count: Words retained from canonical lexicon are: brillig, uffish, whiffling, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish, frabjous, Callooh, Callay — some are canonical coinages (probably counted as canonical). Count ≤8 distinct canonical tokens: here, retains about 8 canonical tokens (brillig, uffish, whiffling, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish, frabjous, Callooh, Callay). Slightly above 8, but borderline. Count is approximately 9 canonical tokens; however, “frabjous” and “Callooh! Callay!” are counted arguably as one token or phrase? Even so, slightly above 8. So no due to borderline or excess canonical tokens.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Jabberwocky lines alternate ~8–9 syllable and ~5–7 syllable lines in quatrains. Here, irregular stanza 1 has 5 lines; other stanzas show lines of length: e.g., stanza 2 (\"He took his Dovetail Saw in hand:\" 7 syll approx, \"Long time the chip-fount rills he sought--\" 8-9 syll, \"So rested he by the Lathe-wood tree\" 8-9 syll, \"And stood a while in thought.\" 6-7 syll). Roughly fits pattern in some stanzas but some lines are shorter/longer than the ideal range. Syllable count not tight and uniform enough in all quatrains, so no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Since only a few stanzas have rhyme, and (2,4) rhymes appear multiple times as \"catch/back,\" \"flame/game,\" \"joy/boy,\" and some reused words like \"back\" repeated; no extensive variety demonstrated. Some end words are repeated more than twice. So no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: Content words like \"He,\" \"his,\" \"the,\" \"and\" common but function words ignored; content word overuse not apparent. No single content word appears over 5 times or >8% of content words. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages appear from different roots: \"Fishtail,\" \"Gouge,\" \"Sweep,\" \"chip-fount,\" \"Lathe-wood,\" \"Dovetail,\" \"sawdusty,\" \"whiffling,\" \"snicker-snack,\" \"beamish\" - various suffixes and roots, more than 4 distinct roots; no suffix accounts for >50% coinages. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem is about a dangerous tool (Fishtail Gouge) in the style and arc of Jabberwocky, matching topic of a Jabberwocky-style battle poem with invented entity; fully adheres to prompt. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied layer: A subtext of craftsmanship, dangers of workspace tools, and rite of passage implied under the action fitting the original poem's tone. Most lines have craftsmanship motifs, implying a deeper meaning.

Actually, second stanza has 4 lines, yes. All stanzas have 4 lines. Total stanza count is 6, which is between 5 and 8. So yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter: alternating longer/shorter line pattern in ≥60% of stanzas. Checking stanza lengths roughly by syllable content: Lines generally not alternating clearly in length; difference of content words uncertain; less than 60% stanzas show strong alternating longer/shorter lines with a two content-word difference. No clear alternating meter as in Jabberwocky.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (2,4) in ≥60% stanzas: rhymes mostly imperfect. Some slant rhymes present (\"know\" - \"slow\", \"grip\" - \"rip\", \"twine\" - \"treat\" (not exact), \"cry\" - \"sky\", \"song\" - \"wrong\", \"rip\" - \"hides\" (no rhyme)). About 3 of 6 stanzas have clear rhymes (1st, 2nd, 4th stanza) in lines 2 and 4; others less clear. So borderline, but less than 60%. Also no complex rhyme pattern avoiding AABB dominance since most stanzas show something like ABCB or ABAB with A lines rhyming less consistently. On balance, no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>No clear ring composition: final stanza does not echo the opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words or a refrain. Opening stanza starts \"'Twas brillig in the tea-time air\"; closing stanza talks about \"Beware the historian of the sip ...\". No repeated content words or refrain across final stanza repeated from first.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present: yes, multiple 'Beware the kyusu' lines at the start indicate caution early in poem.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before encounter: yes, stanza 3 describes protagonist taking kettle, pouring water through filters, preparation before the encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter: The poem lacks a clear adversary encounter between protagonist and adversary. Lines about \"Sencha's gurgling cry,\" \"Splash and splash,\" \"Kyusu's song\" and \"summoned up squibblejibits\" imply an event but not a clear confrontation or adversary meeting in a classic sense. The \"kyusu\" and \"squibblejibits\" might be creatures or objects, but encounter is not clearly framed as confrontation.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>No decisive slaying or resolving action: no decisive act is present that resolves a central tension or battle in the poem.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>No return or celebration: no stanza depicts triumphant return or celebration after a conflict.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Distinct invented coinages ≥8: sencha, splashified, kyusu, whimsy-whirled, gasket, mome-like, splashy servitor, squibblejibits, historian (used non-canonically?), multiple invented compounds, so at least 8 distinct coinages (excluding canonical words).</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains ≥1 coinage: yes, each stanza contains at least one coined phrase or invented term (\"sencha\", \"kyusu\", \"whimsy-whirled\", \"gasket's mome-like grip\", \"filters furry\", \"Sencha's gurgling cry\", \"squibblejibits\"). All six stanzas have coinages.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central to action (not Jabberwock): kyusu (a teapot, not a creature) and squibblejibits (possible creatures). Squibblejibits are named, possibly creatures or entities, and invoked centrally in stanza 5. So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia ≥2 bursts: \"gurgling cry,\" \"splash and splash\" imitate sounds, but no explicit burst words like \"snicker-snack!\" or \"Pop!\", \"Hiss!\" or strong onomatopoeic bursts with exclamation. So onomatopoeia is weak; arguably only one or two mild instances. Needs ≥2 explicit bursts, so borderline no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas clearly beyond incidental: Some alliteration in \"Sencha Splashified Slithy Drip,\" and some consonance in \"filters furry,\" \"fragrant as a treat,\" \"whimsy-whirled\" and \"splashy servitor's sly,\" possibly in two or more stanzas. The alliteration/consonance appears intentional beyond incidental repeats. So yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order (warning, preparation, encounter, decisive act, return/celebration) canonical order: warning in first two stanzas; preparation in stanza 3; no clear encounter (problem in C8); decisive act absent; no return/celebration. So arc incomplete, order break due to missing beats. So no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: no line exactly matches Jabberwocky; all lines different vocabulary and form. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Distinct canonical tokens ≤8: only \"brillig,\" \"slithy\" appear canonical from the canonical lexicon; no other canonical words appear, so ≤8 canonical terms. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines approx. 8-9 syllables, shorter lines approx. 5-7 syllables. E.g. stanza 1 lines: '’Twas brillig in the tea-time air' (7 syllables), 'As sencha steeples wafted there' (7), 'Beware the kyusu, whimsy-whirled and slow' (~9), 'That drips with deadly deliberation, don't you know' (11+ syllables long). Variation and slightly longer 4th lines. Many lines do not tightly match Jabberwocky’s pattern. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) end rhymes repeat few times; rhymes like \"slow/know,\" \"grip/rip,\" \"cry/sky,\" \"song/wrong.\" Rhyme words repeated at least twice; no excessive reuse except acceptable repetition. Rhyme varies fairly well. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no single content word overused excessively; vocabulary varied, repeated words minimal outside repeated coins like \"Beware\" or \"sip.\" No lexical overuse. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages show distinct roots: sencha, splashified, kyusu, whimsy-whirled, gasket, splashy servitor, squibblejibits, historian, mystic rip, foxily. Multiple distinct roots with no single suffix dominating >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly addresses a \"Jabberwocky\"-style nonsense poem about tea/kyusu/steeping rather than Jabberwock itself, but it follows Jabberwocky's topic as a nonsense creature quest style poem with warning/admonition and confrontation with a threat (kyusu/squibblejibits). So topic adhered (a nonsense poem in Jabberwocky style). So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext beyond surface action is weak: suggested undertone of mystical tea-making ritual and danger lurking in steeping, careful respect for tradition, hidden mysteries in leaves. Some implied subtext about patience and probing, maybe cautious curiosity, but overall subtext too subtle and not consistent or clear. No solid or coherent motif or undertone across poem. So no.</C24_think>\n</think>\n\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.5833333333333334, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 0.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.5833333333333334, "criteria_yes": 14, "label": "medium"}

Come to my arms... O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! / He chortled in his joy.\" Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count ≥8: Uses canonical coinages (brillig, slithy, toves, borogoves, mome raths, manxome, uffish, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish) heavily—around 10 canonical coinages. Additionally, \"momraths\" merged word (not canonical) and \"split-grade burn\" compound are new, \"dodging\" bird is not coined. Overall new distinct coinages fewer or zero beyond canonical.

Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas beyond incidental: Some subtle alliteration (e.g., \"beam that bites\", \"contrast sharp\", \"chart\") present; however, no strong multiple stanzas with pronounced alliteration or consonance beyond incidental.

According to instruction, any line equal to a canonical line fails this. Since the poem repeats many lines precisely, answer no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token budget ≤8: The poem uses many canonical terms like \"brillig,\" \"slithy,\" \"toves,\" \"borogoves,\" \"mome,\" \"raths,\" \"manxome,\" \"uffish,\" \"tulgay,\" \"burbled,\" \"snicker-snack,\" \"galumphing,\" \"beamish.\" This is clearly more than 8 distinct canonical tokens.

Yes, an early warning is explicitly present.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: The poem shows the scribe taking position and preparing tools in stanza 2 and 3 (“kiridashi scribe didst take his place”, “kiridashi’s whispering steel didst sow”). Yes, preparation before confrontation implied.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation with adversary or obstacle: The “thezersnorp’s line” in stanza 3 can be interpreted as adversarial, but no clear physical encounter described. More figurative. Partially present but not clear direct confrontation. Borderline no.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying / decisive resolution: No decisive action defeating obstacle described. The poem ends on the final stroke kissing the page, as an artistic act, not a defeat. No slaying or resolution tension resolved. No.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: No return or jubilant homecoming; only description of final artistic product. No celebration. No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Coinages include “kiridashi”, “thezersnorp”, “quoingrath”, “darkling path” (partially figurative), “whimsy’s” used as coinage (questionable). Clearly fewer than 8 distinct invented coinages, only about 3 clear coined words. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage per stanza: Several stanzas lack any distinct coinage (some are purely English common words). Not all stanzas contain a coinage. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named and central (not canonical): “thezersnorp” appears as an adversary or critical concept in stanza 3, resembling a named creature/entity. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: No obvious onomatopoeic bursts (e.g., “snicker-snack”) present. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration or consonance in ≥2 stanzas: Some mild internal consonance but no strong/alliterative patterns clearly evident beyond incidental. No.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning (stanza 3) → Preparation (stanzas 1-2) → Encounter (borderline stanza 3-4) → No decisive act → No return/celebration. Arc beats incomplete and partly out of canonical order (encounter unclear and no decisive act). No.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: No line matches the canonical poem. Wording differs substantially. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token budget ≤8: Contains the canonical word “brillig” only once, “gyre” is changed to “gyre” but different meaning, “toves” replaced by “sloths” (not canonical). Uses own vocabulary, so canonical tokens are very low. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count tightness in quatrains: Lines tend longer than 8-9 or are uneven, many lines exceed the target syllable count, not consistently around 8/6 pattern. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety across stanzas: Limited rhyme variety, some rhyme repeats, but no clear repeated end word more than twice. Probably borderline yes, but overall rhyme quality weak. Borderline no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No strongly overused single content word outside ring echo. No problem here. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Only about 3-4 distinct coinage roots; insufficient variety and some suffix/clustering occurs. No.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem addresses a scribe with a kiridashi (a type of blade), echoing the theme of a protagonist facing an adversary like in Jabberwocky, but focused on scribal craft rather than the original monster theme. The topic does not substitute a completely different subject but shifts the focus to the artistry of a blade and scribing craft. Borderline but yes, the poem adheres loosely to the \"Jabberwocky\" style and thematic arc of battle/adventure, though it is more metaphorical.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem suggests subtext about artistic creation, hidden meaning, and discipline in craft, consistent motif running through the whole poem. Coherent implied layer present. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.4166666666666667, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 0.0, "C16_arc_order": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 0.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 1.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.4166666666666667, "criteria_yes": 10, "label": "low"}
