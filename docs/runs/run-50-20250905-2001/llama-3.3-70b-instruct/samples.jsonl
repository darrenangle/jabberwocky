No, stanzas are mostly 4 lines except stanza 6 with 4 lines as well, but verify count: the poem verses appear to be 6 four-line stanzas. However, the last stanza has 4 lines, so total 6 stanzas with 4 lines each (meets 5–8 quatrains).</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter alternation: In Jabberwocky, lines alternate long(8-9 syllables)/short(5-7 syllables) in ≥60% of stanzas. Here, lines are irregular with many lines exceeding normal meter; the alternation is not strongly evident or consistent in ≥60% stanzas.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme in 2,4 lines: Some rhymes present (play/sway, fine/design, spin/grin, dry/eye, delight/light/play/sway). But check stanza by stanza: stanza 1: play/sway rhyme (yes), stanza 2: fine/design rhyme (yes), stanza 3: spin/grin rhyme (yes), stanza 4: dry/eye (yes), stanza 5: delight/light and stanza 6: play/sway rhyme - mostly rhyme in lines 2 and 4. AABB dominance?: No strong AABB pattern, mostly ABCB or similar rhymes. So ≥60% stanzas have (2,4) rhyme where line2 rhymes with line4, mostly yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoing opening stanza content or refrains using ≥2 repeated content words or clear refrain: The poem ends differently with no direct repeated content words or refrains matching first stanza. No ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition: There is a warning/admonition \"Beware the Blerch, my son…\" early in stanza 1. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation or armament before encounter: Protagonist \"took the vorpal inkbrayer in hand\" and \"set to chasewhile,\" and \"rolled it out with a flourishing fling\" - clear preparation before action.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear meeting between protagonist and adversary/obstacle: The poem is metaphorical about chasing words, not a clear traditional encounter with an adversary. The \"Blerch\" is named but not encountered directly. No direct confrontation stanza describing the meeting.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive act resolving tension: The poem records the act of using the inkbrayer to chasewhile and creates a \"True Nonsense\" work. This is the decisive act, resolving the tension of creating nonsense, though no violent slaying or traditional battle.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return or celebration: The last stanza reflects delight and glee at the result, a positive celebratory tone. So, return/celebration present.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Invented coinages: Inkbray, Chasewhile, Blerch, Flibber, inkbrayer, True Nonsense (phrase), fungible (standard English word but rare usage here), and possibly others like \"frumious\" (canonical). More than 8 distinct coinages? Probably less than 8 distinct coinages since some words are normal English or canonical.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage? Stanza 1: Inkbray, Chasewhile, Blerch, Flibber; stanza 2: vorpal inkbrayer, chasewhile; stanza 3: vowels and consonants (normal words); stanza 4: \"True Nonsense\" phrase; stanza 5 and 6 include references to \"ink\" and \"absurd\" words, but coinage usage sparse, at least 4 stanzas have coinages but not all 6.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical named creature/entity central to action (not Jabberwock): Blerch and Flibber, creatures named; Blerch warned about, Flibber mentioned with tentacles.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: No exclamations or onomatopoeic bursts like snicker-snack, hiss, burble, pop, etc. Absent.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance beyond incidental in ≥2 stanzas: Some mild alliteration (\"fungible forests\", \"most curious design\"); however, no strong repeated consonantal patterns in at least 2 stanzas clearly evident. Probably no.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order (warning → prep → encounter → decisive act → return): Warning (stanza 1), preparation (stanza 2), no strong encounter stanza, decisive act (stanza 4), return/celebration (stanzas 5-6). Encounter stage weak/missing, so arc order not strictly followed.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Any verbatim line from canonical poem: No exact matches detected; words and lines differ from original 'Jabberwocky' lines.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexicon tokens ≤8: Contains 'vorpal', 'frumious' (canonical); 'and', 'the', 'with', 'in', 'he', 'his' (not canonical); so canonical tokens appear under 8 distinctly, favoring new coinages.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: The alternation of longer (≈8-9 syll) and shorter (≈5-7 syll) lines in each quatrain is not consistent or tight. Many lines have irregular syllable counts and rhythm.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme varies stanza-to-stanza with different rhymes mostly, not repeating same exact end words more than twice, so acceptable rhyme variety.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overused excessively; repeated \"ink\" or \"inkbray\" at low frequency, so no overuse issue.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages like Inkbray, Chasewhile, Blerch, Flibber, inkbrayer are from different roots, no single suffix dominates. At least 4 distinct roots, so yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem addresses a nonsensical creature-themed poetic exploration related to 'Jabberwocky' style, focused on ink, words, and invented creatures; matches style topic, no obvious substitution of a different subject.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Implied motif of creative process, chaos in language, new art forms (nonsense creation) detected consistently.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>no</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.5833333333333334, "C1_title_present": 0.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 0.0, "C16_arc_order": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.5833333333333334, "criteria_yes": 14, "label": "medium"}

Need to verify all stanzas have exactly 4 lines. Counting carefully: stanza 1 (4 lines), stanza 2 (4 lines), stanza 3 (4 lines), stanza 4 (4 lines), stanza 5 (4 lines), stanza 6 (4 lines), stanza 7 (4 lines). So all 7 stanzas are quatrains.

From the text: The first stanza lines seem balanced in length, but difference in content words is subtle; line 1 (~8 syll); line 2 (7-8 syll); line 3 and 4 about the same length?

So all stanzas are quatrains and total stanzas is 6 which is between 5 and 8, so yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Check ballad meter: In Jabberwocky, lines alternate longer and shorter with ~8 and ~6 syllables (content words difference ≥2). Checking each stanza for alternating longer/shorter lines:  \n- stanza 1 lines: syllable counts approximate [’Twas brillig (3), & sloths did gym (4); In tulgey woods where wilsox played (8); All mimsy were the borogs made (7)]: Order unclear; no clear alternating pattern.  \n- stanza 2: lines roughly similar length, no clear alternating pattern.  \n- stanza 3: uniform line lengths, no alternating pattern.  \n- stanza 4: lines roughly equal length, no alternating.  \n- stanza 5: equal length lines.  \n- stanza 6: lines fairly even length.  \nLess than 60% (0%) meet alternating longer/shorter. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (2,4) pairs:  \n- stanza 1: gym/played (no rhyme)  \n- stanza 2: shell/reveal (no perfect rhyme but close \"shell\" vs \"reveal\" with -el/-veal sound suggests slant rhyme? Weak slant rhyme, borderline - cautious no.  \n- stanza 3: fork/pork (perfect rhyme)  \n- stanza 4: hum/thrum (perfect rhyme)  \n- stanza 5: cry/by (not exact but near rhyme)  \n- stanza 6: cease/release (perfect rhyme)  \n5/6 stanzas have rhyme in lines 2,4 if allowing slant rhyme and leniency. No dominance of AABB noted because stanzas are quatrains and have a single rhyme pair per stanza. So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza echoes the opening stanza. The poem ends by referencing “tulgey woods” (same as stanza 1: \"In tulgey woods where wilsox played\") and \"mome wraths\" appear in stanza 5 similar to stanza 1’s “borogs” and “mimsy” in stanza 1. However, no two exact repeated content words or clear refrain in the last stanza echoing the first stanza line-for-line or phrase-for-phrase. Since there is a general setting echo but no ≥2 repeated content words or clear refrain, no.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Admonition present? Stanza 2 starts \"Beware the frumious orin bell\", which is an early admonition to beware the antagonist—yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before encounter: Stanza 3 describes “He took the vorpal tuning fork and flumplenooked with skillful pork”. This indicates preparation by the protagonist, so yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: Stanzas 4 and 5 describe the \"frabinous sound did loudly hum\", \"wuggle birds began to thrum\" and “mome wraths outgrabe”… the orin bell's hum passing by causing disturbance. This is the encounter with the adversary/entity “orin bell” producing loud hum disturbing creatures. So yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: The poem implies the protagonist silences the orin bell (“Were silenced by the orin bell’s spree” could mean subdued or more neutral) but line is ambiguous. Last stanza says “And when the orin bell's loud hum did cease,” so the sound stops, presumably due to protagonist’s action, resolving tension. This is a decisive action resolving the conflict, so yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Last stanza refers to creatures stirring and joyous sounds resuming (\"their joyous sounds, in gleeful din\" and \"all was right\"). This implies return to normal/happy resolution—celebration acknowledged. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Invented coinages distinct and ≥8? Counting distinct invented coinages (excluding canonical words):  \n- Orinbellification  \n- Brillig (canonical)  \n- Sloths (English, not coinage)  \n- Gym (English)  \n- Tulgey (canonical)  \n- Wilsox (coinage)  \n- Borogs (variant of borogoves, canonical?) \"Borogoves\" canonical, \"borogs\" derivative but not canonical, accept as coinage.  \n- Frumious (canonical)  \n- Orin bell (compound coined phrase/entity) count as 1?  \n- Tolled (English)  \n- Hum (English)  \n- Shell (English)  \n- Clanged (English)  \n- Clonged (coinage)  \n- Frabinous (coinage, resemble \"frumious\" canonical but distinct)  \n- Flumplenooked (coinage)  \n- Pork (English)  \n- Gleebs (coinage)  \n- Gleams (English)  \n- Wuggle (coinage)  \n- Thrum (English/onomatopoeic)  \n- Cry (English)  \n- Whimsy (English)  \n- Disarray (English)  \nAt least these coinages: Orinbellification, Wilsox, Borogs (variant), Orin bell, Clonged, Frabinous, Flumplenooked, Gleebs, Wuggle = 9 distinct coinages at minimum, so yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza containing ≥1 coinage?  \n- Stanza 1: \"brillig\", \"wilsox\", \"borogs\" (2–3 coinages)  \n- Stanza 2: \"frumious\", \"orin bell\" (\"orin bell\" invented phrase, \"frumious\" canonical but counts for flavor) – Yes coinage.  \n- Stanza 3: \"vorpal\" (canonical), \"flumplenooked\", \"pork\" (English) – yes coinage  \n- Stanza 4: \"frabinous\", \"wuggle\" – yes coinages  \n- Stanza 5: \"mome\" (canonical), \"wraths\" (variant spelling), no clear new coinage but “wraths” is canonical? Actually \"wraths\" is \"raths\" in canonical; \"wraths\" here is variant, accept as spelling variant. No other coinages here except canonical \"mome\". No new coinage here, borderline.  \n- Stanza 6: no coinage except canonical “tulgey” and “orin bell” in previous stanza, but stanza 6 contains no new coined words.  \nSo stanza 5 and 6 without new coinages is 2 of 6 stanzas without coinage, thus only 4 of 6 stanzas have coinage, less than 100% but requirement is ≥1 per stanza. Question says ≥1 coinage per stanza, and borderline on last two stanzas. Since stanza 5 uses “wraths” (variant) and stanza 6 no coined words, partially met but not fully. Because we require a clear coinage per stanza, the borderline means answer is no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named and central to action, other than Jabberwock? Yes, the “orin bell” is the noncanonical creature/entity that is the focus and adversary. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Are there ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts?  \nWords like “burble” (canonical) appear once. \"Clanged and clonged\" are evocative but not standard onomatopoeia (likened to sound). \"Hum\", \"thrum\" are sound words but mild. No clear bursts like 'snicker-snack!' or 'Pop!'. So probably no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration: Check for clear within-line alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas:  \n- Stanza 2: \"frumious orin bell\", \"furious shell\", \"clanged and clonged with frantic zeal\" – repeated 'cl' and 'fr' sounds clearly shown  \n- Stanza 3: “flumplenooked with skillful pork” (some repeated 'p' sounds)  \nAt least 2 stanzas with clear alliteration, yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning in stanza 2; preparation in stanza 3; encounter in 4-5; decisive act implied in stanza 5-6; return/celebration in stanza 6. Matches canonical arc order. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim canonical lines?  \nLines like \"'Twas brillig\", \"All mimsy were the borogs made\" (variant borogoves), but no exact matching line from original. No exact line matches found. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token usage ≤8:  \nCanonical tokens appearing: brillig, tulgey, mimsy, mome, frumious, vorpal (once), sometimes “wraths” variant of “raths”. Count ≤8 is met. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines ~8-9 syllables, shorter lines ~5-7 syllables and rhythmic alternation in quatrains. Lines appear variable and not strictly fitting Jabberwocky’s meter; too irregular for all stanzas. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes occur mostly with different rhyme endings each stanza (fork/pork, hum/thrum, cry/by (slant), cease/release). No end word reused >2 times except canonical repeated words not present here. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overly repeated—\"orin bell\" repeated many times but being the adversary and named entity, not over 5 times or >8% of content words; words like \"the\" common but function words excluded. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety root count: At least 9 coinages with distinct roots; suffix repetition low (e.g., \"-looked\", \"-bell\", \"-clong\"). No single suffix accounts for >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem's topic is evidently about the “orin bell” menace and protagonist’s quest to silence it, matching the structure and topic of Jabberwocky (a confrontation with a creature). Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Poem has surface action of facing/defeating a disruptive sound. Implied theme of restoration of peace and nature's harmony, plus underlying motif of sound vs silence tension, so yes subtext is coherent.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.7916666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.7916666666666666, "criteria_yes": 19, "label": "medium"}
