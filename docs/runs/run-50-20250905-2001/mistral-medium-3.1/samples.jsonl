Here, many stanzas have a similar alternation, e.g., first stanza lines roughly fit longer-shorter pattern (check content words difference at least 2). Most stanzas follow alternating longer-shorter lines. Approximate stanza count with good alternation >=5/8 (≥60%) - yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme: check if lines 2 and 4 rhyme or slant rhyme in ≥60% stanzas; avoid AABB dominance. Most stanzas have rhymes on 2nd and 4th lines (e.g., “glade”/“trade”, “stings”/“clings”, “eyed”/“dried”). No heavy AABB pattern is present. Thus, matches the characteristic rhyme pattern - yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: final stanza echoes first with at least 2 repeated content words or a clear refrain. Final stanza repeats \"’Twas brume\", \"slimy toves\", \"gyre\", \"glimble\", \"glade\" (variant from wabe), \"mimsy\", \"borogoves\" and echoes first stanza theme.

Second stanza includes “Beware the Urushiglass, my son!” a clear admonition line - yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: protagonist takes his *kanshitsu* blade in hand and “waited as the layers dried” before encounter - clear preparation - yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: Urushiglass appears and confronts protagonist (\"came whiffling... blenched his skin with creeping blight!\") - clear confrontation - yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: \"One, two! One, two! The brush went *snick*! ...

Callay!” and the chortle in joy, indicating celebration and return - yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct coined words (non-canonical, non-standard English, excluding canonical Jabberwock lexicon). Coinages: \"Urushiglass\", \"kanshitsu\", \"blenched\" (though English, used uniquely here), \"lacquer-masters\" (compound but English), \"snick\" (allusion to snicker-snack but distinct), “blisters” (normal English). Coinages are fewer than 8 distinct new coinages (main strong coinages: \"Urushiglass\", \"kanshitsu\", \"lacquer-masters\", \"blenched\" maybe marginal, \"snick\"). Coinage count near or below 8, probably borderline under 8 distinct coinages - no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage? Mostly coinages appear in stanzas 2 (Urushiglass), 3 (kanshitsu), 5 (snick), etc., but stanzas 1 and final mostly canonical or English words only. Stanza 1: “brume”, “slimy” (English), “glimble” (coinage?), “lacquer-masters” (English compound). Glimble is a coinage, so stanza 1 has one. Final stanza repeats canonical and English. Thus, roughly each stanza has a coinage (e.g., “glimble”, “Urushiglass”, “kanshitsu”, “Togawa”, “blenched”, “snick”, “itchy joy”, “still paid”?) Some may be borderline but at least 1 per stanza - yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>A non-canonical creature/entity named and central to the action, different from 'Jabberwock'? Named is \"Urushiglass,\" antagonist and central to poem’s action - yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: At least two bursts, e.g., \"*snick*\"; \"whiffling\" (from canonical poem, preserved); “bledching” and “bubbled” not onomatopoeic bursts. “snick” is a smaller onomatopoeia but only one clear burst detected, \"whiffling\" counts as canonical onomatopoeia but the task is to find ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts in the poem outside canonical? “snick” and “whiffling” likely two. “snick” is coined. So yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance beyond incidental in ≥2 stanzas? Examples: “lacquer-masters plied their trade” (l, p,t alliteration); “brush that bites, the fume that stings” (b and f consonance); “ble... blenched... bright” (=bl- alliteration); “fingers aglow” lighter alliteration. At least two stanzas with clear alliteration - yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order check: warning (stanza 2), preparation (3 and 4), encounter (4), decisive act (5), return/celebration (6 and onward), final ring (8). Arc is in canonical order without inversion - yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim canonical lines? Check normalized lines against reference poem lines. Similar lines are changed: “brume” vs “brillig”, “slimy” vs “slithy”, “glimble” vs “gimble”, “glade” vs “wabe”, replacing Jabberwock by Urushiglass, “kanshitsu blade” vs “vorpal sword.” Some lines similar but no exact match to canonical lines. No verbatim lines present - yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used? The poem uses: \"slimy\" and \"mimsy\", \"borogoves\", \"mome\", \"raths\", \"outgrabe\", \"whiffling\", \"uffish\" appear in the poem? “Uffish” present in stanza 4 “And as in uffish thought he stood,” yes; canonical tokens count close to or fewer than 8. Canonical tokens used: toves, mimsy, borogoves, mome, raths, outgrabe (no last stanza outgrabe), whiffling, uffish — about 8 canonical tokens used. This meets ≤8 tokens - yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts for longer lines ~8-9, shorter lines ~5-7 in each quatrain. Examples: stanza 1 line 1 '’Twas brume, and the slimy toves' ≈7 syll, line 2 'Did gyre and glimble in the glade,' ≈8 syll; line 3 ~6 syll, line 4 ~6 syll. Varies but generally within tight control; syllable meter pattern mostly respected in all 8 stanzas - yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes vary enough with no end-word reused more than twice (excluding ring echo). Rhymes: “glade/trade”, “stings/clings”, “eyed/dried”, “bright/blight”, “snick/slow” (slant rhyme?), “dead/slick”, “boy/joy”, “glade/paid”. Most end-words unique; few used twice maximum. Variety present - yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Content word repetition: Outside ring echo, no single content word is repeated excessively (>5 times or >8%). “Shun” repeated 3 times in stanza 2 line 4 (within stanza), overall no excessive repetition detected; common words are connective and not overused. Passes - yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: At least 8 coinages, diverse roots, no single suffix dominates >50%. Coinages include ‘Urushiglass’, ‘kanshitsu’, ‘glimble’, ‘Togawa’, ‘blenched’ (borderline), ‘snick’, ‘lacquer-masters’ (compound), “brume” (less coinage, more English), “blisters”. Roots diverse and suffix dominance below 50% - yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly addresses a confrontation with a named non-canonical creature “Urushiglass” similar to Jabberwocky style, not deviating from the given topic of matching Jabberwocky style - yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: underlying motifs (environmental danger/industrial poison, lacquer-masters, resin, blisters as harm) present, an implied caution about a toxic menace, layering beyond surface action - coherent implied layer detectable - yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.9583333333333334, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.9583333333333334, "criteria_yes": 23, "label": "high"}

No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinages per stanza: Only a few stanzas contain at least one coinage or nonce word (\"Smear,\" \"Spore,\" \"vorpal,\" \"snick-snack,\" \"frabjous,\" \"slithy\"), but possibly less than all stanzas have at least one nonstandard coinage. Some stanzas have only standard English. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: The adversary is named \"the Smear\" and later \"the Spore\", which are non-canonical named creatures central to the poem's action. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: The poem uses \"*snick-snack!*\" (close to canonical \"snicker-snack\"), and also the phrase \"tarry tune\" is not onomatopoeic, no other strong onomatopoeic bursts like \"Pop!,\" \"Hiss!,\" etc. Only 1 clear onomatopoeia burst. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: There are internal alliterations such as \"crossties hummed a tarry tune,\" \"spiky foe,\" \"breath of pitch,\" \"waltz in pungent, creosote line,\" \"swing—snick-snack—so bold.\" At least two stanzas demonstrate clear alliteration or consonance beyond incidental repeats. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The poem proceeds roughly in canonical arc order: warning (stanza 1), encounter (stanza 4), decisive action (stanza 5), but preparation (stanza 3 is more a lament than preparation) is missing or unclear. So arc order is partially off or incomplete. No.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: No line matches exactly any line in the original Jabberwocky poem after normalization. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexicon used: Canonical terms used include \"slithy,\" \"vorpal,\" \"frabjous,\" \"snick-snack\" (modified), \"whiff.\" Canonical tokens ≤8 present. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Lines mostly around 7-10 syllables longer, shorter lines 5-7 syllables, fairly close to Jabberwocky pattern (~8/6). Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The rhyme (2,4) endings vary enough across stanzas with no end word reused more than twice. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No single content word is overused beyond reasonable bounds (no over-5 times or >8% content word use). Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages present are limited and tend to share roots or endings (Smear, Spore). Likely less than 4 distinct roots for coinages. No.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem addresses a Jabberwocky-style creature encounter clearly, even though the subject is a gas or ghostly foe (\"Smear\" and \"Spore\"), so topic about an invented creature match. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is some implied undertone of pollution, decay, or inescapable menace beneath the surface action of a battle against a foe, potentially an allegory for an environmental or existential struggle, giving the poem subtext. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.5833333333333334, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 0.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.5833333333333334, "criteria_yes": 14, "label": "medium"}

Some stanzas do alternate line length and content word differences (e.g., stanza 3 lines: \"He took his wrench in hand so grim\"—longer, then \"And oiled his vice with a sprock and a spin\"—also seems longer, so no clear alternation here; others show moderate alternation.

The first stanza is modified in content words; \"mimsy\" appears as canonical but acceptable; no line fully matches original canonical poem lines verbatim. The ring echo is to its own first stanza, not the canonical poem. So no exact matches with canonical poem lines. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexicon usage: canonical words used are minimal: \"mimsy,\" \"gyre,\" \"uffish,\" \"burble(d)\" possibly \"beamish\" missing here, but \"mimsy,\" \"gyre,\" \"uffish,\" \"burble(d)\" are present. Count of distinct canonical tokens ≤8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable pattern: Longer lines around 8–9 syllables; shorter lines 5–7. Checking stanza 1: line 1 \"’Twas brisk, and the bolts did gyre and glint,\" is 9 syllables; line 2 \"As the plane-iron cambered in slant;\" is 8 syllables; line 3 \"All mimsy were the wing-nuts bent,\" is 7 syllables; line 4 \"And the rivets snicked with a rant.\" is 7 syllables.

Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages derive from multiple distinct roots (\"Jargog,\" \"flivvering flume,\" \"sprock,\" \"spin,\" \"clank,\" \"whirr,\" \"thud,\" \"squeal,\" \"snick,\" \"twang,\" \"camber\"), likely more than 4 roots; suffix repetition does not dominate. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a mechanical/industrial creature like \"Jargog\" and follows a Jabberwocky-style hunting and slaying theme; topic aligns with the source poem style and theme. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is an implied subtext of technological or industrial conflict, struggle against a mechanical adversary, and mastery of tools, echoing themes of challenge and triumph in a modernized setting, consistent across poem.

Stanza count is within 5–8; all are quatrains.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Examining line syllables for alternating longer/shorter lines: The pattern is irregular; only about 3 or fewer stanzas (less than 60%) clearly have the canonical alternating meter style with ≥2 content-word difference in length.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>In most stanzas (≥60%), the 2nd and 4th lines rhyme or slant rhyme (e.g., lips/loops, slick/Slick, din/chin, rude/mud, clang/bang, catch/dear, lips/loops). No consistent AABB dominance. So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza echoes the first stanza with at least 2 repeated content words/phrases: \"’Twas plinkle-plonk,\" \"slithery drips,\" \"All mimsy,\" \"loops\" match closely with opening. Clear ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>An admonition/warning exists early on: second stanza contains “Beware the Puddle-Snatch…” and instructions to beware other creatures.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>The protagonist prepares before encounter: third stanza shows preparation (\"He took his pail…\", \"mended leaks with rusty pin\", \"bobbled beneath the din\"). This counts as planning and armament.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>There is a clear encounter described in stanza 4: the Puddle-Snatch appears, described as coming through watery wood and burbling loud.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>A decisive act resolving tension occurs in stanza 5: \"One, two! One, two! The pail went clang!\"—the ‘battle’ with the Puddle-Snatch is implied with the pail and roof noises, and the protagonist leaves it behind, fleeing.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>The return and celebration stanza is ambiguous. Stanza 6 and 7 have a “come to my arms” and “O frabjous day!” phrase, but the protagonist’s chorused joy is weak and fears leaks. The final stanza returns to the first imagery but lacks a jubilant acknowledgement or triumphant homecoming. So no.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Counting distinct invented coinages: plinkle-plonk, slithery (variant?), gurgle (common word?), eave’s dark lips, misty-wisps, gutter groans, Puddle-Snatch, Sog, Squeak, Slip-Slick, bobbled, uffish, pail, clang, clattery, sprang, twang, drip-soaked, chorused, squelched. Some common English words are used, but the poem uses at least 8 clear invented or compound coinages (e.g., plinkle-plonk, misty-wisps, Puddle-Snatch, Slip-Slick). So likely yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage or fanciful compound: \"plinkle-plonk\", \"slithery,\" \"Puddle-Snatch,\" \"Slip-Slick,\" \"bobbled,\" \"uffish,\" \"clang,\" \"twang,\" \"frabjous,\" \"chorused,\" \"squelched\". So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>The creature named is the “Puddle-Snatch,” which is a non-canonical named entity central to the conflict and action.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts: “clang!”, “clattery bang!”, “sprang!”, “twang!”, “squelched”—multiple instances; clearly ≥2 bursts present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Within-line alliteration/consonance is present, for example “plinkle-plonk,” “slithery drips,” “drip that dribbles, slimy-slick,” “bobbled beneath the din,” “came sloshing… drooled in mud.” At least in two stanzas.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza 2) → preparation (3) → encounter (4) → decisive action (5) → return/celebration (6 & 7). However the celebration is weak and somewhat broken by fear. Still the beats appear in order overall.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No exact line matches from the canonical poem; wording is altered and unique.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used: “slithery” (variant slithy), “mimsy,” “uffish,” “frabjous,” “Callooh! Callay!” “burbled,” “snicker-snack!” (not explicit here), “beamish” (not used), “galumphing” (no), “gyre” (no). Counting strict canonical tokens ≤8; yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count roughly fits ballad meter: longer lines about 8–9 syllables, shorter around 5–7 for most stanzas, close to Jabberwocky’s pattern; some minor deviation but consistently ballad-like.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: many stanzas rhyme words like \"sick/Slick,\" \"lips/loops,\" \"din/chin,\" \"rude/mud,\" \"clang/bang,\" \"catch/dear,\" and the repeated ending “loops” in ring. The rhyme words are not overly repeated; no single rhyme word used more than twice excluding ring. So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No content word is overused (>5 times or >8%). The poem’s content is varied. Common function words aside, coinages and key nouns are not repeated excessively.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show multiple distinct roots: plinkle-plonk, Puddle-Snatch, Slip-Slick, misty-wisps, bobbled, drip-soaked, clattery, etc., more than 4 distinct roots, and no suffix dominates >50%.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>The poem addresses a Jabberwocky-style nonsense theme clearly with battle against a named fictitious creature, mystery/fantasy water-image theme, matching the topic style (even without explicit Jabberwock reference). So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is an implied motif of battling a capricious, slippery menace (water leaks, puddles), with undertones of fear, preparation, and hesitance. A subtle motif about human confrontation with nuisances rather than monsters. Coherent undertone is detectable.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.9166666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.9166666666666666, "criteria_yes": 22, "label": "high"}
