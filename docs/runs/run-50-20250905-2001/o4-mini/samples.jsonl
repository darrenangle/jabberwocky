Thus syllables less tight and alternating patterns less clear - no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes are sparse with little pattern and repeat of similar suffixes limited by rhyme absence.

No clear ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>There is an early admonition: “Beware the Shimmerjowl, my son!” This clearly warns protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation evident: protagonist \"grabbed his glint-axe, sharp and true\" and \"plunged where rafters loom\" before fighting; also toiled \"five hours\" before resolution. Shows preparation and resolve.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter/confrontation line: \"He sawed the shimmer in twain, slew / Its hiss and phantom plume.\" This shows the meeting and clash between protagonist and adversary (Shimmerjowl/shimmer).</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action is present: the adversary is \"sawed ... in twain\" and \"slain\" – the central tension resolved decisively.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration present: The last stanza shows return home \"He flung the glitter to the wind\" and \"Then home he trod ... his burden light as dew,\" and shimmering \"rose again,\" implying positive resolution and celebration.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages count: inventive words like \"quarter-sawn,\" \"shimmerjowl,\" \"blythewood,\" \"woodwisp,\" \"glint-axe,\" \"phantom plume,\" \"timber hearts,\" \"piney glen\"—approx 8 or more. Some are compound or neologisms but count as distinct coined items, ≥8.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage word, e.g., stanza 1 \"quarter-sawn\" \"blythewood,\" stanza 2 \"Shimmerjowl,\" stanza 3 \"glint-axe,\" stanza 4 \"splintered beams,\" stanza 5 \"woodwisp,\" stanza 6 \"piney glen.\" So coinage spread is full.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named non-canonical creature: \"Shimmerjowl\" is named and central to action; it is a non-canonical invention and acts as the adversary creature.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: There is \"hiss\" in stanza 3 (\"slew / Its hiss and phantom plume\"). Only one onomatopoeic burst is present. No second clear onomatopoeic burst such as \"snicker-snack,\" \"pop,\" \"hiss,\" repeatedly or multiple bursts noted. So insufficient for ≥2.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Multiple stanzas show alliteration, e.g. stanza 1 \"quarter-sawn shimmer,\" \"saw-logs gleamed,\" \"chip-tops hopped,\" stanza 5 \"woodwisp fair did dance,\" \"timber hearts.\" At least 2 stanzas show clear internal alliteration/consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order follows canonical flow: warning/admonition (stanza 2), preparation (stanza 3), encounter (stanza 3-4), decisive action (stanza 3-4), return/celebration (stanzas 5-6). Order is respected.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines are verbatim from canonical poem. The model poem is original in phrasing and wording.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens usage minimal: uses \"beware,\" \"my son,\" \"and,\" \"he,\" \"his,\" \"the,\" which are common English, but no canonical nonce words from the reference poem appear. The canonical lexicon budget is low—meets ≤8 distinct canonical tokens.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines mostly 8–9 syllables, shorter lines 6-ish syllables, closely matches Jabberwocky pattern in every quatrain stanza.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme end-words differ across stanzas sufficiently; no word is repeated more than twice except possibly \"shimmer\" in thematic usage but not in end-rhyme. Rhyme is varied.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No content word is overused excessively; \"shimmer\" repeated as coinage but not exceeding 5 times or 8% of content words. No repeated content word overused.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages include multiple distinct roots such as \"quarter-sawn,\" \"shimmerjowl,\" \"blythewood,\" \"glint-axe,\" \"woodwisp,\" \"phantom plume,\" \"timber hearts,\" \"piney glen.\" This meets ≥4 distinct roots and no dominant suffix.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>The poem clearly addresses the topic in a manner analogous to Jabberwocky: a quest to confront a mythical shimmering adversary. Subject is a crafted/shimmer creature, matching the intended style and subject of an invented creature confrontation. No topic mismatch.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem hints at craft, labor, skill, and overcoming difficulty via woodworking metaphor. Implied themes of human mastery and renewal beneath the whimsical surface.

But stanza line counts vary: first stanza has 5 lines (not 4), second stanza 8 lines, third stanza 4 lines, fourth stanza 4 lines, fifth stanza 4 lines, sixth stanza 4 lines. Therefore not all stanzas have exactly 4 lines. Also stanza count is inside 5-8 range but stanza line counts per stanza are uneven, failing quatrain shape requirement.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter analysis difficult due to varied stanza line lengths and inconsistent pattern; no clear ballad meter (alternating longer/shorter line pairs) in majority of stanzas because of uneven stanza line counts and uneven line lengths. Therefore no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme: In multi-line stanzas that are >4 lines, rhyme pattern is unclear and (2,4) rhyme check is not consistently met ≥60% since many stanzas have more than 4 lines and no evident rhyme at positions 2 and 4.

So majority of stanzas contain ≥1 coinage; stanza 6 borderline but overall meets.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>No named creature/entity that is central to action except “Garthly Draunger” mentioned only in admonition, without direct action or encounter involvement.
