The Composing Drum!”", "info": {"topic": "lead type in a composing stick"}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>Yes, there is a clear non-empty title line before the first stanza: \"**The Typesmith's Quest**\".</C1_think>\n<C2_think>Poem stanzas: counting separations by blank lines. There are 5 stanzas, and each stanza is quatrain for the first and last (4 lines), but the second stanza has 8 lines grouped together (no blank line) so not conforming to quatrain shape. Third stanza has 6 lines, fourth stanza has 4 lines, fifth stanza has 8 lines again. So not all stanzas have exactly 4 lines, also stanza count is 5 (within 5-8). But not all stanzas are quatrains. Hence no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Inspecting line length pattern per stanza: The first stanza lines vary in syllable length. However, the second stanza is longer and harder to assess line-by-line. The stanzaal structure is inconsistent. Alternation of longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content words difference in ≥60% stanzas is not clearly met as stanza structure does not hold; lines often quite even length or no clear alternating pattern. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme: The poem does have rhymes at lines 2 and 4 in some stanzas, for example stanza 1 (\"stead\"/\"smiles\" not rhyme); stanza 2 lines 2 and 4 rhyme? \"pass\"/\"Brotherhood\" no; stanza 3 is shorter lines with mixed rhyme; stanza 4 and 5 rhymes are inconsistent. Also, AABB dominance is unclear but stanza 2 and 5 use pairs of rhymes, suggesting some AABB dominance. Because rhyme (2,4) is inconsistent and sometimes absent, no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza echoes some words from the first stanza (\"frumpled ... stikkard-stead\"), the opening phrase repeats exactly, but not a full echo or clear refrain with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases beyond that. Partial repetition but insufficient for a strong ring. No.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition: The second stanza is still a quatrain, but the admonition lines appear in stanza 1 with \"Beware the Monotype, my son! ... Beware the Justify, And shun the Outcast One!\" This is a clear admonition early to the protagonist. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation-armament: The protagonist \"took his fount of seasoned brass,\" and \"He sought the stick with silent pass;\" plus \"he cased the caps of Brotherhood.\" This is a clear preparation and arming before confrontation. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter-Confrontation: The poem lacks an explicit confrontation stanza with a named adversary attacked or interaction described as in reference poem. Instead it goes from preparation to \"One, Two! One, Two! And through the chase\" (fighting implied), but no adversary is clearly shown meeting. Uncertain but mostly no since no direct meeting with named creature; the \"chase\" is abstract.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying-decissive action: \"He left it dead, and with its head He galumphed back to Case.\" This implies decisive action resolved tension. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return-celebration: Multiple references to return, e.g. \"He galumphed back to Case\" and \"He chortled in his metal bed,\" and \"The printer cried... 'Behold! The Composing Drum!'\" suggesting triumphant conclusion. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Distinct invented coinages include \"frumpled,\" \"stikkard-stead,\" \"sloveny,\" \"snatcher-crows,\" \"Monotype,\" \"Justify,\" \"Outcast One,\" \"fount,\" \"brotherhood,\" \"em,\" \"en,\" \"galumphed,\" \"frabjous,\" \"throw,\" \"dumb,\" \"Composing Drum\" (uncertain if all coinages; some standard English). More than 8 distinct coined/made-up or rare words. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Coinages are concentrated mostly in the first and last stanzas. Middle stanzas have fewer or no coinages. At least 3 stanzas contain coinage clearly; some stanzas may not have coinage. So not all stanzas contain coinage. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: The poem has no non-canonical creature/entity named beyond \"Monotype,\" \"Justify,\" \"Outcast One\" which are more concepts than creatures. No canonical or new creature named central to action. No.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Phrases like \"One, Two! One, Two!\" are rhythmic rather than onomatopoeia. No clear bursts like \"snicker-snack,\" \"pop!\" etc. No obvious onomatopoeia. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration or consonance: \"The commas clattered, dashes danced,\" is alliteration; \"lead words all brim and bled,\" also alliteration; so at least 2 stanzas show clear alliteration. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The arc roughly appears—warning early, preparation, then action (\"One, Two! One, Two!\"), some victory, and return—and is roughly canonical order. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines matching canonical poem: The poem uses different words, no lines exactly replicate canonical lines after normalization. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Uses canonical words: \"frabjous,\" \"Callooh! Callay!,\" \"chortled,\" and \"galumphed\" (variant spellings?), but total canonical tokens used are fewer than or equal to 8 (few canonical lexicon words). Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Lines have variable length, many longer lines around 8–9 syllables (e.g., stanza 1 line 1), shorter lines mostly around 6–7. Some lines fall short or longer. Pattern not consistent in all stanzas, but majority roughly match. Percent of stanzas with correct meter is below 60%, so no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhyme (2,4) lines mostly no rhyme or sporadic. No strong rhyme variety; some rhyme pairs repeated. No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No word overused >5 times or above 8% content words except repeated canonical refrains only weakly present. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages include multiple roots: \"frumpled,\" \"stikkard,\" \"snatcher-crows,\" \"Monotype,\" \"Justify,\" \"Outcast,\" \"fount,\" \"brotherhood,\" \"galumphed\" etc. >4 distinct roots, no single suffix dominates. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem addresses a quest involving typesetting—the \"Monotype,\" \"fount,\" \"composing drum\"—which is unique but parallels Jabberwock fight. The topic aligns with the original poem idea (quest, battle) and not drifting. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Underlying motif of printing/type composition and battle with printing challenges is evident across poem. Coherent implied layer is detectable. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.5833333333333334, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.5833333333333334, "criteria_yes": 14, "label": "medium"}

Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive act: stanza 5 shows “One, two! One, two! And through and through / The toasting-fork the vapour flew,” leading to melting “plum gone brown” and resolution of conflict; clearly decisive action resolving central tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: stanza 6 shows “And hastened back, all beamish grin— / “Oh, frabjous bath!” he said within.” This is a jubilant acknowledgement and return; yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: looking for ≥8 distinct invented coinages not from canonical or standard English. Coinages include “blueing,” “plum brown” (compound?), “snicker-snack” (canonical), “toasting-fork” (compound), “flimsic,” “taffy moon,” “beamish” (canonical), “uffish” (canonical), “gurgles back” (no), “blueing burbled” (blueing?), “spire” is regular English, “vapours wild”, “plum” is normal word, “swoon” normal. Coinages over canonical: “blueing,” “toasting-fork” (invented compound), “flimsic,” “taffy moon” (compound coinage), “plum brown” (compound color phrase as coined?), “gurgles back” perhaps no coinage, “sigh and swoon” no coinage. Coinages less than 8 distinct strong coinages—probably well under 8. Thus no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: looking if each stanza contains ≥1 coinage. Stanza 1 has “plum,” “blueing,” “wabe-wrought ire” (wabe is canonical), “spire” normal. Stanza 2 has “snicker-snack” canonical, “gurgles back” no. Stanza 3 has “toasting-fork” coined. Stanza 4 “blueing” again, “burble” canonical, “flimsic” coined. Stanza 5 “toasting-fork,” “taffy moon” coined. Stanza 6 “beamish” canonical. Stanza 7 “brillig,” “plum,” “brown,” “seared” normal words, “blueing.” So except stanza 2 (\"gurgles back\" no coinage, \"snicker-snack\" canonical), and stanza 6 (“beamish” canonical only), most stanzas have at least one coined term. So no, because stanza 2 and 6 do not have distinct invented coinages not canonical/standard.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: does a non-canonical creature/entity appear that is central and not “Jabberwock”? The poem’s adversary is the “bath” or “blueing” (the bath/steam/foam). The poem warns “Beware the bath.” The adversary seems to be the bath/steam as an entity; but no specific unique creature name given beyond “bath.” “Blueing” is an adjective or coinage here describing bath or foam, not a creature name. So no named distinct creature besides ‘bath’ which is generic and not a coinage creature name. No specific coined creature name unlike “Jabberwock.”</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: at least 2 onomatopoeic bursts. “snicker-snack” (canonical onomatopoeia) appears in stanza 2 and 5. “hiss” in stanza 1. “gurgles” in stanza 2, arguably onomatopoeic. So yes, at least two onomatopoeic bursts.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: at least two stanzas have clear alliteration. Examples: stanza 1 “plum did gleam / In brownish light” (moderate), “blueing foam”/“wabe-wrought ire” strong consonance. Stanza 2 “bath, my beamish child” alliteration of b and ch sounds; stanza 4 “burble[d], soft it brooded”; stanza 5 “through and through,” “toasting-fork the vapour flew.” So ≥2 stanzas with clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats; yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza 2), preparation (3), encounter (4), decisive act (5), return/celebration (6), ring echo (8). The arc beats appear in canonical order; yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line matches verbatim any line in canonical poem; all lines are original or distinct in wording; yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token budget ≤8: canonical words from reference such as “brillig,” “beamish,” “snicker-snack,” “uffish,” “wabe,” “borogoves,” “mome,” “tulgey” appear in the poem as well; tokens like “brillig,” “beamish,” “snicker-snack,” “uffish,” “wabe” appear here. The poem reuses ≤8 of these terms; 5 appear (“brillig,” “beamish,” “snicker-snack,” “wabe,” “uffish” no, actually “uffish” does not appear in model poem), “uffish” no, “tulgey” no, “mome” no, “borogoves” no. About 4–5 canonical tokens used; so canonical budget is ≤8; yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines near 8–9 syllables, shorter lines near 5–7. Sampling first stanza longer lines around 8 syllables (“’Twas brillig, and the plum did gleam” 8 syll), (“In brownish light of midmost dream” 8 syll), shorter lines similarly 6/7 syll. Majority of quatrains fit syllable pattern; yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: several different (2,4) rhymes are used, e.g., “gleam/dream,” “child/wild,” “snicker-snack/gurgles back,” “hand/scanned,” “brooded/air” (slant), “through/swoon,” “ached/quake,” “grin/within,” “bless/cleared.” No end word reused more than twice outside ring echo; yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: no single content word overused; no word >5 times or >8% of content words; yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages present but limited to less than 4 distinct roots. “Blueing,” “toasting-fork,” “flimsic,” “taffy moon” distinct coinages; “plum brown” is color phrase, may not count as coined root but close to 4 coinages with distinct roots: “blueing,” “toasting-fork,” “flimsic,” “taffy.” No single coinage suffix dominates >50%; yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem imitates Jabberwocky with a different central subject: a mysterious bath/foam/steam encounter. The topic is consistent; addresses an invented Jabberwocky-style adventure about a bath; no substitution of topic. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is a coherent implied layer about a cleansing or transformative ritual (bath), with undertones of fear, challenge, overcoming by protagonist; hints at purification metaphor; yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.875, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.875, "criteria_yes": 21, "label": "high"}

Yes.</C1_think>\n<C2_think>Total stanza count is 8; all stanzas are quatrains (4 lines each). Meets requirement.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Checking alternation of longer/short lines within quatrains with ≥2 content word difference in ≥60% of stanzas: The original Jabberwocky uses a roughly iambic 8-6-8-6 pattern per stanza. Here, the poem seems more free, with lines roughly similar length or no clear longer-shorter alternation in at least 5 of 8 stanzas. Likely no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (2,4) is present in most stanzas with some slant rhyme: e.g., \"bite\" / \"white\" (stanza 2), \"play\" / \"grieve\" (s5), \"complete\" / \"heat\" (s7), etc. No clear AABB dominance, and at least 5-6 stanzas conform to rhyme (2,4). So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza partially recalls opening lines but with different wording (\"’Twas brillig, and the fools now peer\" vs original \"’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\"). Only '’Twas brillig' repeated in the last stanza, and no ≥2 repeated content words or formal refrain. Probably no.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition is present, stanza 2: \"Beware the Pietra Ponder, child! The chisel’s nimble bite! Beware the dappled inlay wild, And shun the grout’s dead white!\" Clear warning to protagonist. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before encounter is shown. Stanza 3: \"He took his graver sharp and keen, Long years in study spent; He sought the hues unseen, unseen, In quarry caverns bent.\" Indicates preparation, study, resolve. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter/confrontation in stanza 5: \"One, two! One, two! The pincers play! Through shell and stone they weave; And spangles spill in disarray—But ne’er a fragment grieve!\" Presents a kind of conflict or action moment. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: stanza 7 includes \"He left it set, the frame complete, No gap for doubt or flaw—A silent bloom of coloured heat,\" indicating completion and resolution. Effectively ends central tension by accomplishment. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: last stanza is more reflective, not clearly jubilant homecoming or celebration. It is ambiguous and more philosophical. No clear 'return and joyful acknowledgement' beat. No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented coinages (non-canonical, non-standard English): \"Pietra Ponder,\" \"masons,\" \"tesserae,\" \"chime,\" \"stitch,\" \"dappled,\" \"grout,\" \"graver,\" \"quarry caverns,\" \"semi-precious,\" \"jasper whim,\" \"chalcedote,\" \"agate,\" \"pincers,\" \"spangles,\" \"lapis snow,\" \"coloured heat,\" \"shrieking truth.\" Some are English words, some possibly specialized or poetic, but coinages require novelty as Lewis Carroll's invented words or equally strange. Words like tesserae, chalcedote, jasper are real mineral or mosaic terms, so not true coinages. Even ignoring canonical lexicon, real coinages are minimal - \"Pietra Ponder\" (title), maybe \"chalcedote\" as variant of chalcedony (standard mineral), \"graver\" is real English noun. Therefore, probably fewer than 8 coined words. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Does each stanza contain at least one coinage? Unlikely, given coinages are rare overall. Most stanzas seem to use normal English vocabulary rather than invented coinages. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: \"Pietra Ponder\" is named, but entity type is ambiguous—seems to personify stone or mosaic art rather than an animate creature or antagonist. It's central to the poem as challenger/puzzle. This fits the criterion (not Jabberwock). Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Searching for bursts like \"snicker-snack\", \"pop\", \"hiss\" etc. The only similar is \"One, two! One, two!\" (counting), which does not count as onomatopoeia, and \"chai\" or \"pincers play\" (no onomatopoeic words). No evident onomatopoeic bursts. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas: Examples: \"pincers play\", \"spangles spill\", \"silent bloom\", \"shrieking truth\", \"chasel’s chime\", etc. There is noticeable alliteration in some stanzas, probably in at least two stanzas. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza 2), preparation (3), encounter (5), decisive action (7), return/celebration (8) (though last is weak). This matches canonical arc order. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line matches exactly a canonical poem line. Some wording similar (\"’Twas brillig,\" opening and final stanza), but no line is identical to any original line (normalizing punctuation, whitespace). Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used include \"’Twas brillig\" (2), \"uffish\" (1), so 3 tokens. Must be ≤8. No other canonical tokens found. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Checking syllable counts per quatrain lines. Longer lines mostly about 8-9 syllables; shorter lines about 5-7 syllables? Sampling: line lengths vary; line 3 in stanza 3 is \"He sought the hues unseen, unseen,\" (7 syllables), line 1 around 7-8 syll. Generally met consistently across stanzas. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes vary across stanzas: bite/white, keen/bent (slant), play/grieve, grow/snow, complete/heat, peer/see. No rhyme word repeated more than twice. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No single content word seems overused. The words \"stone\" and \"unseen\" repeat twice but nowhere near >5 times or 8% frequency. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: with very few coinages present overall, no extensive root repetition appears. But since total coinages <8, coinage variety is not applicable. No.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem addresses the topic indirectly through homage to Jabberwocky style poem, focusing on a crafted mosaic stone challenge (\"Pietra Ponder\") as central antagonist/subject. Topic adherence is good (matches Jabberwocky style poem with a similar theme). Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: poem conveys motif of art vs life, contemplation, craftsmanship, the living nature of stone/art.

Long lines ~8-9 syllables, short lines ~5-7 syllables; need alternating pattern in majority stanzas. Most stanzas have alternating line lengths (e.g., stanza 1: lines 1&3 longer, 2&4 shorter). The difference in length/content words is uncertain in some but roughly present in majority (5 or more). So tentatively yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (2,4) in ≥60% stanzas, allowing slant rhyme, and avoiding AABB dominance. Rhyme pairs: st1 (gleamed/beamed) rhyme; st2 (dear/craft) -- not rhyme; st3 (steel/sought/sought/bolt) rhyme on 2&4? 'sought' and 'bolt' are a slant rhyme, ok; st4: wood/shove (no rhyme); st5: spun/won (perfect rhyme); st6: beamed/beamed (repetition), 3rd and 4th lines rhyme? No. St7: Come/drum rhyme; st8: bear/compare rhyme. So roughly ≥60% stanzas have (2,4) rhyme: st1,3,5,7,8. Also, some use partial / slant rhymes and no strong pattern of AABB overly dominant. So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes the opening stanza with phrase \"’Twas brillig, and the wainscot gleamed\" (similar to opening \"’Twas brillig, and the wainscot gleamed\"). Repeated phrase appears twice in the poem (opening and near end). Also, refrains \"Oh, frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\" echo canonical refrain, but that is subcanonical. Two or more content word repeats appear in final stanza from first stanza. So yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early stanza 2 contains an admonition \"Beware the oaken splinter, dear! / The gralloch plank with splinters sheer! / Beware the parlour’s creeping draft\" - an explicit warning to the protagonist. So yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Stanza 3 shows the protagonist preparing: \"He took his adze of elder steel, / And sought the sawdust-spouting wheel; / Long time the twisting stave he sought— / Then rested at the quarry’s bolt.\" This implies preparation and gathering of tool and resolve. So yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Stanza 4 describes an apparition or encounter: \"And as in uffish thought he stood, / There came a wobble through the wood: / A lumber-lurch, a creaking shove— / The logbird screeched, the vaultwood dove!\" Clear meeting between protagonist and creature \"logbird.\" So yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Stanza 5 shows decisive action and resolution: \"One, two! One, two! The sander spun! / He left it dead, and with it, won.\" So a decisive confrontation and slaying appears. So yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Stanza 6-8 show return and celebration: stanza 6 begins with repetition (ring composition), stanza 7 \"I’ll shoofle thee with splendour-drum!\" and stanza 8 references bearing boards with quarter-sawn shimmer \"beyond compare!\" – celebration. So yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented coinages excluding canonical ones: wainscot, gralloch, skirting-snickerer, adze, sawdust-spouting, twisting stave, quarry’s bolt, uffish (canonical), wobble, lumber-lurch, creaking shove, logbird (creature), vaultwood, ribling, grumbo-rings, shoofle, splendour-drum, flimsy fray, rath-outfitted, quarter-sawn shimmer. There are at least 8 distinct new coinages. So yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage: e.g., stanza 1 \"wainscot\"; stanza 2 \"gralloch,\" \"skirting-snickerer\"; stanza 3 \"adze,\" \"sawdust-spouting\"; stanza 4 \"wobble,\" \"lumber-lurch,\" \"logbird,\" \"vaultwood\"; stanza 5 \"sander,\" \"grumbo-rings\"; stanza 6 \"wainscot,\" \"quarter-sawn shimmer\"; stanza 7 \"shoofle,\" \"splendour-drum,\" \"rath-outfitted\"; stanza 8 \"quarter-sawn shimmer.\" So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature named \"logbird\" is central to action (slain in stanza 5). Not \"Jabberwock.\" So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeic bursts: \"skirting-snickerer’s\" (snicker is onomatopoeic), \"lumber-lurch,\" \"creaking shove,\" \"ribling,\" \"grumbo-rings\" (perhaps coinages with sound associations). Direct strong onomatopoeic bursts >2 present. So yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: stanza 1 \"quarter-sawn shimmer softly,\" stanza 4 \"lumber-lurch,\" \"logbird,\" \"vaultwood,\" stanza 7 \"shoofle thee with splendour-drum,\" stanza 5 \"sander spun,\" \"he left it dead\" has some consonance. At least 2 stanzas show clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental. So yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Admonition (st2) → Preparation (st3) → Encounter (st4) → Decisive action (st5) → Return/celebration (st6-8). Matches canonical arc order. So yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines exactly match canonical poem lines. Some phrases repeated, but no verbatim line equality after normalization. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used: brillig, uffish, frabjous, callooh, callay, snicker (partial), beamish absent, others absent. Canonical lexicon under 8 distinct tokens. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Longer lines around 8-9 syllables; shorter lines approximately 5-7 syllables as in Jabberwocky. Stanzas mostly respect meter tightness. So yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Varied rhyme (2,4) endings across stanzas: gleamed/beamed; sheer/craft (no); sought/bolt (slant); wood/shove (no), spun/won; beamed/fray; come/drum; bear/compare. No exact end word repeated >2 times excluding ring echo phrase. So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word overused: coinages and content words are varied, no significant lexical over repetition. No content word used over 5 times or over 8% of total content words except for ring phrases. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show variety: wainscot, gralloch, skirting-snickerer, adze, sawdust-spouting, twisting stave, quarry’s bolt, wobble, lumber-lurch, logbird, vaultwood, ribling, grumbo-rings, shoofle, splendour-drum, flimsy fray, rath-outfitted, quarter-sawn shimmer. These involve multiple roots, suffixes do not dominate >50%. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem clearly matches topic style of Jabberwocky: mimics nonsense style, arc, and naming conventions, with a similar adventure/creature theme, matching the required topic adherence.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Beyond surface, the poem gestures to timber/crafting metaphor (quarter-sawn shimmer, lumber-lurch, skirting-snickerer), possibly about woodworking struggle or craft as metaphor. So an implied subtext/coherent undertone is present.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 1.0, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 1.0, "criteria_yes": 24, "label": "high"}

Actually last stanza is 4 lines except the last line has a trailing quote, so 9 stanzas total which is >8; this violates stanza count requirement.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Checking quatrains for alternating longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content-word difference: roughly, stanzas 1-8 mostly show some alternation (e.g., longer line, shorter line, longer, shorter), but stanza 5 lines seem more even; overall likely fewer than 60% meet strictly.

No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhyme pairs are few in number and repeated, 2–4 lines rhyme in some stanzas but with repeated rhymes (\"wood\"/\"shuns\" no rhyme, \"day\"/\"unshed\" slant rhyme).

O split-grade flare!”", "info": {"topic": "split‑grade enlarger burn"}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>Title present before first stanza line: \"The Snicketree Grind\" is given as a separate title line, so yes.</C1_think>\n<C2_think>Stanzas count: poem has 6 stanzas. Line counts per stanza: 1st stanza 6 lines (longer than quatrain), 2nd stanza 4 lines (quatrain), 3rd stanza 6 lines, 4th stanza 7 lines, 5th stanza 5 lines, 6th stanza 6 lines. Not all stanzas are quatrains. Total stanzas are 6, which fits into 5-8, but all stanzas are not quatrains and consistent 4 lines per stanza is violated, so no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter: Jabberwocky uses alternating longer and shorter lines per stanza (typically 8-9 and 5-7 syllables alternating). Here, stanza lines lengths vary and many stanzas are longer than 4 lines. Also, the alternating longer/shorter line pattern is unclear for majority of stanzas, with multiple 6+ line stanzas making strict alternation difficult. Ballad meter check fails the 60% threshold confidently, so no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme: Jabberwocky rhymes lines 2 and 4 in quatrains. Here, many stanzas are longer, rhyme pattern less clear; in the quatrain stanza (2nd stanza), rhyme 2/4 is \"sought\"/\"thought\" which rhyme well. Other stanzas have inconsistent rhyme schemes, often ending lines with different words or weak rhymes. Also, AABB dominance is questionable but since stanza sizes vary, conformity is poor. Overall ≥60% stanzas do not maintain the rhyme pattern clearly—no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Final stanza echoes the opening stanza with repeated wording or refrains? The last stanza mentions \"O frabjous burns! O split-grade flare!\", echoing \"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\" from reference, but not the initial stanza's content words. The first stanza and last stanza do not have 2 or more repeated content words or clear refrain. The first stanza contains unique words like 'blimmering', 'darkling frame', 'sprolls', 'grame', 'clank', 'shadow-turn'. The last stanza references \"O frabjous...\" but this is more a borrowed phrase than a strict echo of opening. So no clear ring echo with 2+ repeated content words or direct refrain—no.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition: The 1st stanza ends with \"Beware the Snicketree, my grame,/The clank that twists the shadow-turn! / Beware the Lensewax, shun the beam,\" indicating explicit admonitions to beware adversaries clearly early on — yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: The protagonist takes \"fumble-tongs in hand;\" and \"Long time the dusky foe he sought— / Then rested he by the tripod stand, / And stood awhile in quiet thought.\" This is clear preparation before encounter. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: The poem narrates \"And, as in nishy thought he stood, The Snicketree, with mutter-gleam, came whiffing through the gloom!\" and then battle lines follow, signifying clear meeting/confrontation. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: The protagonist \"His burning blade he drove with might, / And slowly oozed the tonal spice,\" and the action corresponds to the decisive act. The \"tonal spice\" oozing sounds like resolution of tension, so yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Multiple lines show celebration: \"He chirped in glee,\" \"He chortled in his triumph,\" \"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\" and the last stanza depicts calmness and joy, so yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Distinct invented words not English nor canonical Jabberwocky include: blimmering, sprolls, grame, clank (common word), shadow-turn (compound coined?), Lensewax, dodges, fumble-tongs, dusky foe (dusky common word, foe common), nishy, mutter-gleam, whiffing (common), easel, flare, chirped (common), flong, phiff, proof, runcible (canonical), snicketree, tripod stand, tonal spice, tray, split-grade, burn, rockin/ rocking chair. Counting distinct clearly coined words >8: blimmering, sprolls, grame, shadow-turn, Lensewax, dodges, fumble-tongs, nishy, mutter-gleam, flong, phiff, snicketree, runcible*, runcible is canonical. Thus at least 8 coinages are present >8. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Does each stanza have ≥1 coinage?  \nStanza 1: blimmering, sprolls, grame, shadow-turn, Lensewax, dodges (multiple) - yes  \nStanza 2: fumble-tongs, dusky foe (foe common), tripod stand (common), rest pass, thought common - fumble-tongs yes - yes  \nStanza 3: nishy, mutter-gleam, whiffing (common, but mutter-gleam counts as coinage), gloom (common) - yes  \nStanza 4: hiss, sputter (common), clank, clatter (common), easel, tonal spice (tonal spice compound coined?), yes - yes  \nStanza 5: frabjous day, callooh, callay (canonical), chortled (common) - no new coinage distinct? Possibly no  \nStanza 6: blimmering (repeat), runcible (canonical), runcible dream, burns, split-grade flare - split-grade (compound coined?), possibly yes  \nAt least stanza 5 lacks a new coinage distinct from canonical. Because stanza 5 uses canonical coinage or common words, no new coinage—so less than 6/6 coinage coverage — no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: The named creature is \"Snicketree,\" which is clearly non-canonical and central (antagonist). Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Words like \"hiss\", \"sputter\", \"clank\", \"clatter\", \"whiffing\", \"chirped\" are onomatopoeic to some degree. \"Clank!\" and \"clatter!\" are bursts. At least two onomatopoeic bursts exist — yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance:  \n1st stanza: \"blimmering in the darkling frame,\" (alliteration of b and d) and \"sprolls did rattle and the glaze did burn\" (r sound repeated), \"Beware the Snicketree, my grame,\" (S/g hard sounds), some consonance present.  \nAnother stanza: \"Then rested he by the tripod stand,\" mild alliteration of t's.  \n\"While flong and phiff came dancing back\" (flong, phiff - similar consonant bursts,) some within line consonance.  \nAt least two stanzas show clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats — yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order:  \nWarning/admonition (1st stanza),  \nPreparation (2nd stanza),  \nEncounter (3rd stanza - Snicketree appears),  \nDecisive action (4th stanza - battle),  \nReturn/celebration (5th and 6th stanzas) order overall is roughly maintained though stanzas are uneven in length; no evident reordering or inversion - yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines:  \nCheck canonical lines in poem: none exactly match the canonical poem lines. Some phrases like \"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\" appear verbatim, which are canonical lines (last stanza line). This violates the rule. So no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget ≤8 tokens:  \nThe poem uses 'O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!' and 'runcible' (canonical), some others? Words like \"He chortled\" are common, chortled is in canonical. \"Whiffing\" is not canonical, \"snicker-snack\" is not present.  \nCanonical tokens appearing: frabjous, callooh, callay, runcible, chortled; 5 tokens. Canonical tokens ≤8, so yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness:  \nJabberwocky approximately 8-9 syllables long lines, shorter lines about 5-7 syllables. This poem has stanza lines longer than 4, varying lengths; syllables per line often not matching pattern. Thus the strict syllable count alternating pattern is not met in every quatrain stanza (many stanzas not quatrains). No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety:  \nRhyme (2,4) pattern inconsistent across stanzas, some stanzas have same ending words repeated more than twice (\"thought\" in stanza 2 and \"thought\" also appears in 3rd stanza?) [not exactly repeated], but stanzas lacking clear rhyme schemes, difficult to verify rhyme variety but due to little rhyme variety and repeated use of \"thought\" rhyme, no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard:  \nNo content word appears clearly overused beyond limit (like >5 times or 8%); repetition of \"called\", \"he\", \"and\" are function words; content words mostly varied. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety:  \nCoinages have multiple distinct roots: blimmering, sprolls, grame, shadow-turn, Lensewax, dodges, fumble-tongs, nishy, mutter-gleam, flong, phiff, snicketree, split-grade. Over 4 distinct roots with no single suffix dominating. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence:  \nPoem addresses a similar topic as Jabberwocky: a protagonist battling a strange creature named Snicketree with an invented weapon in a strange world, having a victory and return. So adherence is yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext:  \nThere is an underlying theme of creative/artistic process (mentions of \"darkroom,\" \"print,\" \"tonal spice,\" \"grading,\" \"easel,\" \"proof,\" \"split-grade flare,\" \"rocking chair\"), suggesting artistic creation or photography metaphor. Thus a coherent implied subtext is detectable across poem. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.6666666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 0.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.6666666666666666, "criteria_yes": 16, "label": "medium"}

The pattern partially echoes jabberwocky with longer-shorter alternation but not strongly consistent across majority; roughly 4 of 7 stanzas show clear alternation, borderline but must be strict, so answer no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme: (2,4) rhyme in most stanzas. Stanza 1: \"scribe\" / \"brimble\" no; 2: \"Bandersnatch\" / \"eave\" no; 3: \"flint\" / \"shadow-hair\" no; 4: \"page\" / \"cry\" no; 5: \"through\" / \"sly\" no; 6: \"scored\" / \"quave\" no; 7: \"waverwood\" / \"core\" no. There is very little evidence of consistent rhyme on 2 and 4; therefore no rhyme pattern as required.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza echoes the opening stanza with repeated phrase \"'Twas frumpling in the waverwood\" (partial), and \"gyred no more\" echoes the action of \"did gyre and gimble.\" However, only one or two repeated content words/phrases; partial refrain is present but weak. The canonical poem’s ring echo is strong and nearly verbatim. Here it is weak, so no.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present: Stanza 1 and 2 have \"Beware the Kiridashi, my scribe\" and \"Beware the Parchment Bandersnatch\" - early admonitions clearly stated.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: There is no explicit stanza about the protagonist preparing his tool or planning or waiting. The scribe \"took his graven burin bold\" and \"went galumphing\" without a described preparation action; no waiting/planning stanza. So no.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: A clear meeting is in stanza 3 and 4 describing the Kiridashi with \"eyes of flint\" and it thrashes the page; clear confrontation/encounter present.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying decisive action: The decisive action is in stanza 5, the scribe slashes \"One, two! One, two! And through and through / The scribe went slashing, swift and sly.\" The tension is resolved here by the scribe's action.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: The final stanzas describe the scribe \"hastened back\" and \"wore a grin\", \"chortled in his scribing core,\" and \"handed round the quills\"; a return and celebration is implied but somewhat muted and not very jubilant. Still an acknowledgement of victory and joy, so yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage: Coinages or invented words include frumpling, waverwood, veeves, brimble, Kiridashi, graven burin (though \"burin\" is somewhat known but unusual), scritch, whiffled, klick, quave, scribing core (fabricated phrases). At least 8 distinct coinages are present.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza contains at least one coinage word; spread is sufficient.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: Kiridashi is the named non-canonical creature/entity central to the poem’s conflict (not \"Jabberwock\"). Kiridashi is central.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: The poem has \"scritch\", \"whiffled\", \"sizzling stroke\", \"slashing\", but mainly \"scritch\" and \"whiffled\" as sound words. Only two or more onomatopoeic bursts are present, sufficient.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Several stanzas show within-line alliteration such as \"scribe\", \"sharpened\", \"shadow-hair\"; \"sizzling stroke\" and \"swift and sly\"; yes for ≥2 stanzas.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The arc follows warning (stanza 1-2), skipping explicit preparation, then encounter (3-4), then decisive action (5), then return and celebration (6-7). Except missing preparation beat, arc mostly in canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines appear; all lines are distinct or reworded.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens count: The poem uses very few canonical tokens (wabe, gyre, gimble, uffish, galumphing, chortled, beamish not seen here). Only \"galumphing\" and \"uffish\" present once or twice; total canonical tokens ≤8, so ok.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines approximately 8–9 syllables, shorter lines 5–7. For example stanza 1 lines:  \n1: ’Twas frumpling in the waverwood (7)  \n2: And all the veeves did gyre and gimble; (9)  \n3: Beware the Kiridashi, my scribe, (7)  \n4: Beware the sharpened nib’s gray brimble!
