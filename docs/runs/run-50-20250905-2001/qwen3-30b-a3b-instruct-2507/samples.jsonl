For example, stanza 1: line 1 and 3 longer; stanza 2: lines 1 and 3 longer; stanza 3 is irregular with a sudden burst but overall alternating pattern mostly holds in 5/8 stanzas, so ≥60% satisfied.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme pattern: stanza 1 (wabe/outgrabe) rhymes, stanza 2 (Blight/Vigil) mostly slant rhyme; stanza 3 rhymes \"eye/Flicker/suddenly/snicker\" partially but less clear; stanza 4 rhymes \"curls/shawm/twirl/ground\" partial; not a strict AABB but more ABCB or slant rhyme. Stanzas 5-8 have some rhymes on lines 2 and 4, often slant rhymes. More than 60% stanzas maintain rhyme in lines 2 and 4, no dominance of AABB. So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes some phrases from opening \"The bloom is night...\" and first stanza references \"brillig, slithy\" canonical words; but no clear refrain repeating ≥2 exact content words/phrases from first stanza’s core beyond canonical lexicon. The last stanza's lines do not repeat major content words from first stanza as a ring refrain.

So no.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>No return or celebration: poem ends with warning and lament but no jubilant homecoming or celebration by protagonist; no return home indicated.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: words like \"Jibbering Blight\", \"Cereus Vigil\", \"muffled snicker\", \"velvet shawm\", \"frabjous\" (canonical), \"tulgey\" (canonical), \"snicker\" (close to canonical 'snicker-snack'). Counting distinct invented coinages: 'Jibbering', 'Blight' (not coinage), 'Cereus Vigil' (phrase but \"vigil\" standard English), 'shawm' (uncommon but dictionary word, musical instrument), 'glow' and 'snicker' are English, so counting words coined uniquely is borderline, 'flicker' is English. So fewer than 8 distinct invented coinages, mostly standard words or canonical reuse. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinages spread: as few coinages, not all stanzas contain invented coinages; most stanzas have standard English or canonical words only. So no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: \"Jibbering Blight\" and \"Cereus Vigil\" seem to be the named adversaries/entities; \"Cereus\" is a real cactus genus, \"Vigil\" is English, but \"Jibbering Blight\" is a coined adversary word, serving as creature/entity name central to poem. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: some onomatopoeic bursts occur such as \"*snicker*\", \"*click*\", also muffled *snicker*, but only these; at least 2 different onomatopoeic bursts present: snicker, click.

Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (\"Beware…\" stanza 2), preparation (taking quill, pricking eye stanza 3), confrontation (stanza 4-5 with bloom waking, spines, petals), no decisive slaying act, no return/celebration. So arc beats mostly in canonical order except missing decisive act and return. Partial arc but missing steps -> no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: lines such as \"'Twas brillig, and the slithy thorn / Did gyre and gimble in the wabe\" closely echo canonical lines but differ via \"thorn\" and slightly altered; no exact line matches after normalization.

So all stanzas are quatrains, but total stanza count is 10 which is more than upper bound 8—thus fails count limit.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Check ballad meter: Jabberwocky uses alternating long-short line pattern roughly 8-9 syllables then 5-7 syllables. Here, scanned sample quatrains show mostly similar lengths per line within stanzas, but does not clearly alternate longer/shorter line pattern with ≥2 content-word difference in ≥60% of stanzas. Lines are more uniform in length. So no clear echo of ballad meter.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme pattern: The end rhymes of lines (2,4) in most stanzas often rhyme or slant rhyme, e.g., glimmering doom / jumbly gloom, beep / snide (less exact), law / ploop (weak rhyme), tangling / lullaby (no rhyme), twirl / spire / sigh / dies (half internal rhyme), glide / tide / flare (not rhyme with prior), wobbly / bobbly / more / pour (approximates rhyme scheme), twink / blink, snarled / warbled, etc. Many stanzas have (2,4) rhymes but some are slant or weak. The pattern avoids AABB dominance because stanzas mostly follow ABCB or similar. So ≥60% stanzas have (2,4) rhymes, acceptable.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza does not clearly echo opening stanza lines or content words explicitly. While \"’Twas brillig\" is canonical and used only in stanza 1, here we have \"’Twas slithy\" (slithy is canonical), but the ending repeats no clear refrain or ≥2 repeated content words or phrase from opening stanza. So no clear ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>At stanza 2, there is the admonition \"Beware the *Squelch*! The *Vibra-Weep*,\" which is an early warning similar in style to Jabberwocky, so yes an early caution is present.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Stanza 3 and stanza 6 suggest preparation: \"He took his *modular* flanger’s claw\" and \"He *twitched* the *funk* with *nervous* *glide*\" indicating preparation, tool in hand, resolve to act, so preparation is present.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear confrontation is less explicit but implied: the warning targets “Squelch” and “Vibra-Weep,” while stanza 6 describes active fighting or manipulation \"hissed and zapped\", and stanza 7-8 shows the “patch” going wibbly-wobbly and “osc” going bloop, implying encounter and conflict with adversary patch-spider entity, so encounter/confrontation is present.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action appears in stanza 6-7 where protagonist “hissed and zapped with frenzy flare” and “patch-spiders ate the signal there,” and stanza 7 shows the patch going wobbly, indicating resolution of tension by action. So decisive action is present.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: No clear jubilation or homecoming. Final stanza ends with “So slippeth he, with merry grin, Back to the patch, the gloom, the spine,” which suggests returning but no clear joy or celebration, just retreat / continuation. So no clear jubilant celebration.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct coinages: Coinages include synth, snick, glibbering, blurb, jumbly, glurp, glimmering, squelch, vibra-weep, dithering, blork, flim-flam, hiss, modular, squelched, sine, lurching, tremy-trompe, thwick, ploop, jink, shriek, dizzy-loop, wiffle, mangle, wavetables, barnacle, filter, lullaby (common word but here somewhat unusual poetic usage), spaghetti (common), jack-fleas, hear (common), spire, attak-drip, release, glimpses, grins, dies, twitched, funk, nervous, glide, noise, blooped, circuit, hissed, zapped, frenzy, flare, patch-spiders, signal, snick, wibbly-wobbly, osc, bloop, snicked, bobbly, fader, flick, gloop, glub, wires, slithy (canonical), cables, twink, thrum, twirls, shiny, blink, synth (again), shoobled, froozled, snarled, tangle-spars, warbled, jumbled, shuffled, spun, merry, grin, patch, gloom, spine.\n\nFiltering for clearly invented or novel coined words: glibbering, blurb, jumbly, glurp, squelch, vibra-weep, blork, flim-flam, modular (common but here technical), tremy-trompe, thwick, ploop, jink, shriek (common English), dizzy-loop, wiffle, mangle, wavetables, barnacle (common), lullaby (common), jack-fleas, attak-drip, squelched (derivational), glimpses (common), patch-spiders, wibbly-wobbly, snicked (derivational), bobbly, fader (common), gloop, glub, shoobled, froozled, snarled (common), tangle-spars, warbled (common), jumbled (common).\n\nCounting distinct strong coinages with distinct roots: glibbering, blurb, jumbly, glurp, squelch, vibra-weep, blork, flim-flam, tremy-trompe, thwick, ploop, jink, wiffle, barnacle (common noun used poetically but not canonical), jack-fleas, attak-drip, patch-spiders, wibbly-wobbly, bobbly, gloop, glub, shoobled, froozled, tangle-spars. That's well over 8 distinct invented coinages, so yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one invented coinage or at least non-canonical technical word or nonce word, e.g. stanza 1: synth, snick, glibbering; stanza 2: squelch, vibra-weep, blork; stanza 3: modular, tremy-trompe; stanza 4: wiffle, wavetables, barnacle; stanza 5: patch, jack-fleas, attak-drip; stanza 6: funk, nois, zapped; stanza 7: snick, wobbly, osc; stanza 8: slithy (canonical), cables, twink; stanza 9: shoobled, froozled; stanza 10: jumbled, spun, patch, gloom. So yes all stanzas contain coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature name: patch-spider (hybrid imaginary creature) named explicitly and central to action; also other creature-like coined names like \"jack-fleas\" and \"squelch,\" but patch-spider is main entity. So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: presence of words like “snick”, “hiss”, “zapped”, “bloop”, “snicker-snack” is relevant. Text contains two or more onomatopoeic bursts or sound-imitating words: e.g., “snick,” “hiss,” “bloop,” “snicked,” “zapped.” So yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration and consonance: multiple stanzas show clear within-line alliteration and consonance beyond incidental, e.g., stanza 1 “synth did snick,” “glibbering blurb,” stanza 2 “dithering crook and thrum in beep,\" stanza 3 “tremy-trompe with thwick and ploop,” stanza 9 “shoobled, froozled, snarled,” stanza 10 “jumbled, shuffled, spun,” etc. So yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Early admonition (stanza 2), then preparation (stanza 3 and 6), then encounter (throughout stanza 6-7), decisive act (stanza 6-7), but return/celebration missing or weak (last stanza is return with “merry grin” but no real celebration). Since return/celebration is essential final step and missing, arc order is broken. So no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line verbatim matches canonical poem; though some canonical words appear (’Twas brillig, slithy), no line matches exactly any Jabberwocky line once normalized, so yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens count: Used canonical tokens: brillig, slithy - two occurrences; no canonical creatures (Jabberwock, Bandersnatch, Jubjub, etc.) named except \"slithy.\" Canonical token count well below 8, good favoring new coinages, so yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines roughly 8-9 syllables and shorter lines 5-7 in Jabberwocky. Here scanned quatrains show some longer lines above 9 or below 8, shorter lines may be longer than 7; there is irregular syllable count and not tight control; alternation weak. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme endings vary a lot across stanzas with no repeated exact end word >2 times; last stanza end rhymes differ from earlier ones; no excessive repetition. So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word appears overly frequently (>5 times or >8%); coined words have controlled spread; overall balanced lexicon. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages drawn from many roots and morphemes, e.g. glibber, blurb, jumbly, glurp, squelch, vibra-weep, blork, flim-flam, tremy-trompe, thwick, ploop, jink, wiffle, barnacle used creatively, jack-fleas, attak-drip, patch-spiders, wibbly-wobbly, bobbly, gloop, glub, shoobled, froozled, tangle-spars. No single suffix accounts for >50% so coinage variety is high. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Clear topic is a creature / entity called patch-spider and protagonist’s encounter with it, strongly in Jabberwock style with verbal coinages and narrative.

So no.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return or celebration present: stanza 4 has joyous chortle, but no clear return or homecoming described.

No explicit bursts e.g., \"Pop!\", \"Hiss!\" observed.

Arc is not strictly canonical order -> no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim canonical lines present? Some lines match the reference poem exactly, e.g., stanza 1 \"’Twas brillig, and the slithy snarks / Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;\" close but \"snarks\" instead of \"toves\" and \"borogroves\" instead of \"borogoves\". Original line \"’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves / Did gyre and gimble in the wabe\" is changed slightly. No exact matches of canonical lines found (slight alterations).

Lines vary - e.g., stanza one lines mostly 7-8 syllables, stanza five 'grymmish bright, pramphlax' lines short. Meter is inconsistent and less controlled than Jabberwocky. Only partially met, so no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: many stanzas reuse rhymes like 'wabe'/'outgrabe', 'flash' rhymes multiple times. Rhyme variety low, with several repeated rhymes and end words reused more than twice. So no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no obvious overuse of any single content word exceeding 5 or 8%. Some canonical words repeated (borogroves, pramphlax) but total token count balanced. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages such as pramphlax, borogroves, grymmish, spumfled, bryzne, gollygush, flumped, flomped indicate ≥4 distinct roots and suffix patterns (not dominated by one suffix). Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem addresses a similar fantastical creature narrative with a named creature, close to Jabberwocky style. Topic of confronting a mysterious fierce creature is sustained. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: implied undertone of bravery, mystery, cautious admiration, loss (\"the borogroves did weep\") is present but patchy.

So no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter pattern checking: Jabberwocky alternates longer (≈8–9 syllables) and shorter (≈5–7 syllables) lines roughly in each quatrain. Here, many stanzas have mixed syllable counts without clear alternating longer/shorter lines, and it is not consistent in ≥60% of stanzas. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme: The poem rhymes (2,4), mostly slant rhymes or close rhymes (e.g., swayed/shade; son/sigh; flight/night). No AABB dominance. Rhyme present in most stanzas well over 60%. So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza does not clearly echo the opening stanza with ≥2 content words or a clear refrain phrase. The final stanza is more abstract and different, no recognizable ring composition or direct repetition from the first stanza. No.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present: The 2nd stanza starts with \"Beware the Pantograph, my son!\" clearly an admonition/warning similar to canonical poem. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: The 3rd stanza describes the protagonist taking \"his lath and bound with string,\" preparing and readying his tool before the encounter. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: Present around stanza 7 - \"He met the Blade with a quiver-snap,\" so a clear encounter with the adversary. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: The line \"Then still the wires in the night\" after \"a tangle of thrum and thump\" implies the decisive defeat or shutdown of the adversary. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: The final stanzas do not show a clear jubilant return or celebration, more a quiet rest or sleep, lacking clear celebratory tone or homecoming rejoicing. No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Several non-standard words coined or invented: \"tangle-trove,\" \"zibber,\" \"slurred,\" \"mome,\" \"wabbling,\" \"quiver-quack,\" \"fribbled,\" \"snortled,\" \"cobbled,\" \"frumious,\" \"whirrs,\" \"flump,\" \"jingle-jangle,\" \"flutter-twitch,\" \"quiver-snap,\" \"thrum,\" \"tangle\" (used more creatively). At least 8 distinct coinages (excluding canonical). Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Most stanzas contain at least 1 coinage or nonce word, e.g., “tangle-trove,” “zibber,” “jingle-jangle,” “fribbled,” “snortled,” “flutter-twitch,” “quiver-snap,” “thrum,” “whirrs.” More than half, actually nearly all. Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: The adversary is named \"Pantograph\" and \"Bungling-Blade\" which are non-canonical. The Pantograph is central to the poem's action, clearly an antagonist figure. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Uses onomatopoeic bursts: \"jingle-jangle,\" \"flump,\" \"snortled,\" \"quiver-quack,\" \"snicker-snack\" is canonical but not used here; \"chortled\" (from canonical), \"whirring,\" \"thrum,\" \"thump.\" At least 2 clear onomatopoeic bursts: \"jingle-jangle,\" \"flump,\" \"snortled,\" \"quiver-quack,\" etc. Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Multiple stanzas show alliteration beyond incidental repeats, e.g., \"slithy wires bent and swayed,\" \"flutter-twitch,\" \"caught it mid its arcing flight,\" \"blue-lit gloom,\" \"whirring whine,\" clear alliteration present in multiple stanzas. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The poem follows the canonical arc in order: admonition (stanza 2), preparation (3), encounter (7), decisive action (8), but no clear return/celebration at the end (10). So order mostly followed but missing last beat. Since last beat is missing, strictness calls for no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim lines: No lines exactly match canonical Jabberwocky lines after normalization. None of the canonical lines appear verbatim here. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Only 5 canonical tokens appear: brillig, slithy, mome, raths, chirped (not canonical), some canonical words are omitted or minimal. \"mome,\" \"raths,\" \"brillig,\" \"slithy\" present in opening stanza only. Under 8 distinct canonical tokens. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: The longer lines are often around 8–9 syllables, shorter about 5–7 syllables, but some lines exceed or are below, inconsistent across quatrains. Not consistent ≥60% of stanzas, so no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhyme endings vary (e.g., swayed/shade, son/sigh, runs/eye, air/twitch, come/hum, sang/gloom, snap/flight, thump/night, nod/died, blue/deep). No rhyme words used more than twice except repeated \"Pantograph\" which is a proper noun, so variety maintained. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overused excessively; \"Pantograph\" and \"Blade\" used repeatedly but under 5 times or under 8% content word share. No overuse detected. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages come from multiple distinct roots: \"tangle-trove,\" \"zibber,\" \"quiver-quack,\" \"jingle-jangle,\" \"flump,\" \"fribbled,\" \"snortled,\" \"flutter-twitch,\" \"cobbled,\" \"thrum,\" \"thump,\" \"whirrs,\" \"whirring,\" \"zing and sigh.\" No single suffix dominates >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a similarly styled invented creature (\"Pantograph\") and a battle theme, matching the style of Jabberwocky and clearly focused on the same topic structure. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is a subtle undertone of technology and wires blending with nature, a motif of industrial/laborious tension and resolution implied under the surface. This suggests a coherent subtext beyond surface action. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.75, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.75, "criteria_yes": 18, "label": "medium"}

Less than 60% of stanzas show alternating line lengths with large difference.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme check on lines (2,4) per stanza: many stanzas rhyme lines 2 and 4 easily (e.g., \"shone\"/\"moaned\", \"fangs\"/\"Fangs\", \"stick\"/\"twirls\" partial at best, \"wring\"/ \"ring\"), but some stanzas have slant rhyme or no rhyme. No AABB dominance; mostly ABAB or ABCB. Over 60% stanzas with (2,4) rhyme but some are slant or imperfect.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>No final stanza repeats two or more content words/phrases from opening stanza or clear refrain.

Counting distinct outright invented forms: approx 4-5, less than 8.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Not every stanza includes a coinage; many stanzas use standard English words or only repeated coinages. Coinages appear scattered, not in every stanza.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Protagonist/adversary creature named and central to action?: \"Cumberling\" named and presents warning, but no central action revolves clearly around it. Other named entities like \"Fumble-flap\", but these seem secondary descriptors.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts? No clear examples like \"snicker-snack\" or \"Pop!\" present. No sound words imitating noises explicitly.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance? Some mild alliteration such as \"fluttering swirls\", \"feathered, fluttering\", \"twisted the wind and wring\" but no strong or clearly intentional lines in at least 2 stanzas. Possibly borderline no.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc beats order: warning → prep → encounter → decisive action → return/celebration: warning present early; no prep; no clear encounter; no decisive action; no return, so arc order incomplete.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No exact matching canonical lines from reference poem visible, though some phrases borrowed (\"’Twas brillig\", \"Beware the... my son!\").

few stanzas show clear ballad meter alternation, borderline but not definitive.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (2,4) in stanzas: Only about 3 or 4 stanzas show clear rhyme pairs at lines 2 and 4; dominant rhyme scheme is inconsistent, and AABB pattern not clearly dominant, but the rhyme pattern is weak and below 60%.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza does contain repeated words or phrases from the beginning (\"wabe\", \"chattering joy\") but no strong phrase repetition or clear refrain; slight echo but not meeting criterion of at least two repeated content words/phrases strongly from opening stanza.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition is present: stanza 2 says \"Beware the Linty Brayer, my son!\" which is a direct warning/admonition.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>The protagonist prepares with specific named tools or action: stanza 3 shows taking the brayer and standing in the tinter's glade, and applying skill (\"With fiddle-faddle thump, he thumped the edge\") indicating preparation before confrontation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation is unclear: no named adversary creature distinctly opposing the protagonist in a clear meeting; \"linty brayer\" is more a warning than an adversary that appears and is met; no direct confrontation stanza evident.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action occurs in stanza 3 and following: protagonist thumps the brayer, impacting the linocut; this is an action resolving some tension but no killing/slaying of a named creature or foe occurs—ambiguous if decisive action in the sense of resolving a central tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration are weak but present: stanzas 6 and 7 show triumph (\"he knew he’d won\", \"bore it off in triumph’s grace\", \"all his kin did cheer\") and joyful return implied.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Number of distinct coined words: brayers, linos, grumbly, glurk, fiddle-faddle, squiggle-geometries, miffled, squithy, glome—at least 9 distinct coinages present.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Every stanza contains at least one coinage or invented term: yes, each stanza has at least one unusual or coined word.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>No specific non-canonical creature named and central: \"Linty Brayer\" might be considered entity but it's mostly an object; no mythical creature beyond canonical \"mome raths\" which are canonical; no novel creature as central actor (Linty Brayer functions more as a warning subject, not an opponent).</C13_think>\n<C14_think>No onomatopoeic bursts like \"snicker-snack,\" \"pop,\" \"hiss\" present meaningfully; \"fiddle-faddle thump\" is borderline onomatopoeia but not clear bursts; no clear onomatopoeic bursts matching Jabberwocky style.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Several stanzas have alliteration: \"brayer, brayers,\" \"fiddle-faddle thump,\" \"chatter, chortling,\" \"chattering joy\";

total canonical tokens likely ≤8, consistent with favoring new coinages.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts do not clearly replicate jabberwocky’s strict ~8/6 pattern, lines show significant variance in length, generally longer lines often under 7 syllables or too variable; does not meet syllable tightness in every stanza.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes vary, but rhyme endings are sometimes repeated over stanzas; no exact end word reused more than twice, so OK on variety.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: The word \"brayer\" appears multiple times, but no content word exceeds 5 usages or 8% of content words; lexical repetition is guarded.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages include at least four distinct roots (\"brayer,\" \"glurk,\" \"fiddle-faddle,\" \"squiggle,\" \"miffled\"), no suffix dominates more than 50% of coinages; coinage variety confirmed.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>The poem addresses a topic related to the \"brayer\" and linocut printing, a creative reinterpretation maintaining Jabberwocky theme but focused on artistic printmaking, not substituting a very different subject; topic adherence is present.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext implies an undertone of artistic creation, craftsmanship, triumph through skill, echoing Jabberwocky’s heroic motif but with artistic tools;

Beware the cathode...'\" - yes, explicit admonition early on.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation or armament before encounter?  \nIn stanza 5: \"He took his multimeter in hand\" indicating preparation with tool before action. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter or confrontation?  \nThere are references to flickering tubes and warnings, but no clear description of meeting with an adversary or obstacle. The poem personifies device elements but no direct encounter. No definite confrontation scene.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive slaying or resolution of tension?  \nStanza 6 says \"The tube was dead, the lamp was red\" indicating device failure, but no strong decisive action described by protagonist. Indirect, not clearly decisive combat action; wording is vague. No.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return or celebration after victory?  \nLast stanza describes sleep, quiet grace, and warning to not look closely but no return or joyous celebration. No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Number of distinct invented coinages (non-canonical / non-English standard words invented for poem)?  \nCoinages include: Nixie, cathode, anodes, grid, numb(as adjective), blink! (onomatopoeia), phosphor, voltage, fiver (unclear if invented?), decade (standard English), hex (borrowed from math), bloom (standard), vacuum (standard), spark, crystal, resistor, cap, shunt, multimeter, measured, current, morse, dial, vibration, tube, lamp, glow, flicker.  \nMost are standard technical/electrical terms, not invented nonce coinages.  \nNo invented neologisms clearly. Less than 8 clear coinages.  \nNo.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Does each stanza contain ≥1 coinage?  \nSince coinages are absent or standard words, no.  \nNo consistent invented words in each stanza.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central to action?  \n\"Nixie tube\" is an actual old tech device name, not a creature per se, but personified. No new creature invented. No named monster or fantastical entity central to action besides the tube which is a known object. No.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts?  \nLine \"blink! blink! blink!\" is onomatopoeic. No other clear burst word like \"snicker-snack\" or \"Pop!\" present. Only one clear onomatopoeic burst. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Clear alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas?  \nSome alliteration (e.g. “warm, soft *glow*” maybe), but overall sparse and not clear in multiple stanzas distinctively. Probably no strong evidence for two stanzas with clear non-incidental alliteration/consonance. No.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order (warning → preparation → encounter → decisive action → return/celebration) in canonical order?  \nWarning (stanza 1) → Preparation (5) → no clear encounter (fails) → limited decisive action (no) → no return/celebration.  \nSequence broken; no encounter or return.

No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety—different pairs across stanzas; no reuse >2 times?  \nSince rhyme pairs mostly weak / absent, no strong rhyme variety but also few repeated rhymes. No strong violation but since rhyme overall very weak, considered no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard—no single content word overused?  \n\"Beware\", \"cathode\", \"glow\" repeated about 2-3 times but not >5 or >8% frequency over ~100+ content words. Lexical repetition acceptable. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety—≥4 distinct roots, no dominant suffix >50%?  \nSince coinages nearly absent, fails.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence—poem addresses a \"Nixie tube\" and its glow (electronic device) clearly, not diverging to unrelated subject. Topic coherent.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext—There is a subtle undertone about fading technology and fragility of old electronics, perhaps evoking nostalgia and warning about over-examining fragile tech.

Required 5 to 8 stanzas. All stanzas except 1 seem 4 lines; stanza 1 has 4 lines; stanzas 2-9 also mostly 4 lines, but stanza 5 has 5 lines (\"The *camber* flashed!\" stanza). So one stanza with 5 lines breaks requirement.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Checking meter (long/short line alternation with ≥2 content words difference) in ≥60% of stanzas. Lines mostly irregular in length; many coinages complicate scan. Some alternating longer/shorter evident but not consistent in most stanzas. Estimated fewer than 60% meet ballad alternating meter strongly.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (2,4) checked in stanzas: multiple stanzas have matching or slant rhymes on lines 2 and 4 (e.g. \"snort\" / \"short\", \"night\" / \"light\", however some are weak or not clearly rhymed. No apparent AABB dominance as stanzas mostly ABXB or ABCB style. Approximately ≥60% stanzas have rhyme (2,4).</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes opening with repeated content words or refrain. Final stanza repeated \"flim\", \"sprockle\", \"whiffle\", \"fand\" echo earlier coinages. Opening stanza uses \"whiffle\", \"flim-foam\", \"mimsy\", \"cromble\", \"fandly\"—repetitions of coined terms occur multiple times, but no exact refrain line repeats. However, enough repeated coinages and the structure points to ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Admonition present early: stanza 1 explicit \"Beware the flim-foam, my son!\".</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: no clear tool or weapon preparation line, no explicit waiting, planning, or arming before confrontation. The poem is more abstract/no direct \"weapon taken\" line. No obvious preparation seen.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter present: stanzas describe movement toward adversary (\"snarl\", \"cambered\", \"whiffle storm\", \"sniffled at the dun sea\"), but no very clear meeting line. Stanza 4 (\"He fribbled to the schnort\") and following suggest confrontation, but identification of a specific adversary unclear. Probably yes as central struggle implied.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: \"The camber flashed! The iron snore,\" + \"And zibbled back the fandly throne\" suggests action defeating opponent or change in tide. Descriptions suggest decisive act (flash, snore, zibbled back).</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: last stanza shows \"zimmled in the sand, And sniffled at the dun sea!\"—possibly a return or aftermath but no overt jubilant acknowledgement or \"O frabjous day\" style celebration. Seems more neutral than celebratory, so no.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Counting distinct invented coinages: many unique coined words like \"whiffle\", \"flim-foam\", \"cromble\", \"fandly\", \"quill\", \"zim\", \"pox\", \"glibber\", \"snort\", \"crickled\", \"sprockle\", \"wibbles\", \"flims\", \"crumbly\", \"flink\", \"snoodle\", \"twiddle\", \"whirrel-woozle\", \"pingle\", \"sprocket-woots\", \"fribbled\", \"schnort\", \"jimble\", \"cramble\", \"sproggled\", \"fumble\", \"zibber-zob\", \"snarly\", \"thrum\", \"zazz\", \"zibbled\", \"sniffled\" etc. Well over eight distinct coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Every stanza contains at least one coinage; no stanza purely canonical English words.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named: no clear canonical creature or distinct named adversary beyond coinages. \"flim-foam\" may be an adversary but unclear if \"creature\". Not canonical Jabberwock creatures, but does poem name a central enemy? \"flim-foam\" is named and seems adversarial. So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Some bursts like \"whiffle\", \"snort\", \"snorling\", \"sniffled\", \"zibbled\" may count as onomatopoeic bursts. But at least two clearly onomatopoeic bursts exist (\"snort!\", \"whiffle\").</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Multiple stanzas show internal alliteration, e.g., \"sprocket-woots burning bright\", \"sniffer at the dun sea\", \"fribbled to the schnort\", \"crumbly cromble, snorling free\". Evident in ≥2 stanzas.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning (stanza 1), encounter (middle stanzas), decisive action (stanza 5-6), return (last stanzas). Preparation stage missing or weak. So partial order but fails full canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No exact line matches canonical poem lines. All lines appear new and with many novel coinages and syntax.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical words used: \"brillig\" only once, no other canonical lexicon present. Canonical tokens ≤8: yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts: Longer lines mostly ~8-9 syllables, shorter lines ~5-7 syllables visible after estimation, pattern roughly matches Jabberwocky meter pattern in most stanzas with 4 lines. Some irregularity but mostly acceptable.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety across stanzas: (2,4) rhyme endings mostly different, no repeated exact end word >2 times. Seems varied.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: no single content word is overused. Coinages are numerous and diverse, no word above 5 repetitions or >8% content word frequency.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: many coinages with different roots/prefixes/suffixes, no suffix accounting for >50%. At least four distinct roots identified among coinages.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem is structured around a Jabberwocky-like nonsense creature conflict and has the \"Beware\" warning mood consistent with the original poem. The poem does not substitute subject but presents a new creature \"flim-foam\" in similar style. So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Some abstract undertones of conflict and struggle, mood of warning and confrontation, albeit obscure.

So not all stanzas are quatrains, total stanza count 7 (within 5-8). Because the last stanza is 5 lines, this criterion fails.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter: Checking alternating longer/shorter lines with ~2 content-word difference. Mostly long lines 8-9 syllables, shorter ones about 5-7 syllables. But the poem’s meter is irregular; the alternation in length is not obvious or consistent in ≥60% of stanzas. Partially met but uncertain so default no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme (2,4 rhyme per stanza and slant rhyme allowed), avoiding AABB: Analysis shows a mix of rhyme and slant rhyme, but many stanzas do not have clear (2,4) rhyme. Several stanzas appear unrhymed or with weak rhyme. Less than 60% have clear (2,4) rhyme. No strong consistent rhyme pattern detected.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Last stanza partially echoes the first stanza as \"The Sencha Kyusu still drips—*and glows*\" and \"’twas brillig, and the kyusu did gyre\" first stanza—however no ≥2 repeated content words or clear refrain between first and last stanza; no exact repeated phrases; mostly only the topic \"Sencha Kyusu\" recurring. Not distinct or clear enough for ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition early: Second stanza has \"Beware the Kyusu, with eyes of dew\" and \"And shun the Sencha\"—so yes, an early admonition is present.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: Third stanza shows protagonist taking cup and sipping with care and catching the drip; also stanza four describes some brewing action (\"the kyusu wove,\" \"fumbles danced\") indicating preparation or engagement. So yes, preparation present before action.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: There is no explicit adversary or creature confrontation in the style of Jabberwocky. The poem is more contemplative about a tea drip and its qualities; no clear meeting or confrontation with an adversary or obstacle. So no.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: No decisive act resolving tension. The poem lacks a climactic battle or resolution. No slaying or similar action. No.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: There is chortling in stanza four \"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\" but overall no return from a quest or triumphant homecoming. The mood is celebratory of the tea, but no narrative return. Borderline, but no clear return/celebration event. So no.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Novel coinages include kyusu, pookas, snurged, thyrled, grumble-grim, tangle-steam, fumbles danced, plurals of coined words, \"plentidged,\" lather-love, glorps, spat, sim, kettledreams—more than 8 distinct invented coinages, yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza appears to contain at least one coined word (\"kyusu,\" \"snurged,\" \"thyrled,\" \"grumble-grim,\" \"plentidged,\" \"glorps,\" \"kettledreams,\" etc.). So yes, coinage present in every stanza.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature named: \"Kyusu\" is named, which is actually a type of Japanese teapot, but here treated as a creature/adversary (with eyes of dew, dripping snicker-snack). It's a named non-canonical entity central to poem action, yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Uses \"snicker-snack,\" and onomatopoeic bursts like \"*glorps*,\" \"*spat*,\" \"*sim*,\" so at least two onomatopoeic bursts. Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Multiple stanzas show alliteration: e.g., \"snicker-snack,\" \"steam,\" \"sentinel,\" \"Sencha,\" \"spat,\" \"sip,\" \"sipped with flair,\" consonance in \"tassels,\" \"tea-gleams,\" \"fumbles danced,\" etc. At least two stanzas have notable alliteration. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza 2), preparation (stanza 3), encounter? Not really, but there's sipping and interaction in stanza 3–4, then no decisive encounter or slaying. The order is incomplete or broken. No.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines from canonical poem: Some words match (’twas brillig), \"snicker-snack,\" \"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\" but no entire lines exactly match canonical lines when normalized. So yes, no verbatim lines.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: The poem uses 'brillig', 'mome raths', 'snicker-snack', 'O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'; also 'kyusu' a new coinage. Count canonical tokens under or equal to 8: 'brillig', 'mome', 'raths', 'snicker-snack', 'O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!' counted as canonical. Counted items approx 5-6, below 8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Lines vary, longer lines mostly 8-9 syllables, shorter lines 5-7 syllables in quatrains. The last stanza is 5 lines and slightly less tight. Mostly yes with minor variability, but the last stanza violates quatrain shape, so syllable tightness impacted negatively. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The (2,4) rhymes are not very consistent and the same rhyme endings appear more than twice; some overlap and limited rhyme variety. So no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No content word appears excessively; repeated \"kyusu\" and \"Sencha\" are expected topic words but below threshold overuse. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages 'kyusu', 'pookas', 'snurged', 'thyrled', 'grumble-grim', 'tangle-steam', 'plentidged', 'lather-love', 'glorps', 'spat', 'sim', 'kettledreams' indicate multiple different roots and suffixes, no single suffix >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem is about the Sencha Kyusu drip (a tea pot/drip), matching the poem’s title and content; no unrelated subject. So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied motif: The poem implies a reverent, almost ritualistic meditation on tea brewing and its quiet magic, using mood, invented language, and imagery.
