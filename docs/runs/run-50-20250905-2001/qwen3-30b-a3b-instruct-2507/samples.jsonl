The *Rumble-Drum*!  \nIts rattle sings a jingling hum;  \nIt slithers low on sizzling spines,  \nAnd bounces on the roof’s hard veins,  \nWith *plonk* and *plock*, and *tink* and *thrum*,  \nAnd *zizz* the drops from sky's full drum!\n\nBeware the *Pitter-Pat* of fear,  \nThat skitters down, so light, so clear;  \nIt flits and frolics, wild and keen,  \nWith *plip* and *plup* and *drip* unseen,  \nAnd snaps the silence, thin and high,  \nLike tiny bells on a lullaby.\n\n'Twas mimsy, and the gutters wept,  \nThe *Rumble-Drum* had stolen sleep;  \nThe puddles grinned with silver eyes,  \nAnd the roof did sing in hidden sighs.  \nWith flabberjig and frabjous clatter,  \nIt danced on metal, swift and fatter.\n\nSo flee! For the *Rumble-Drum* is near,  \nAnd the roof sings loud — a lullaby drear!  \nBut hark! The rain has turned to slow,  \nAnd silence drapes the world below…  \nWhere once the *Rumble-Drum* did roam,  \nNow only echoes hum and foam —  \nAnd somewhere, in the dripping dark,  \nA final *plip*… and then — a spark.", "info": {}}
