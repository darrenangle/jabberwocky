The pattern of line syllables shows little clear alternation of longer/shorter lines by ≥2 content-word difference, also the lines are fairly uniform in length and rhythm, so no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme pattern: lines 2 and 4 do rhyme clearly in most stanzas: \"strayed\"/\"zeal\" (slant rhyme? weak), \"day\"/\"fray\" (yes), \"stood\"/\"good\" (yes), \"keen\"/\"unseen\" (yes), \"pressed\"/\"prim\" (no), \"fine\"/\"design\" (yes). 4 or 5 stanzas with (2,4) rhyme out of 6 is ≥60%. AABB pattern? Not dominating; mostly ABAB or ABCB varieties. Slight weakness in stanza 1 & 5 rhyme pair. Overall borderline but leans yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza repeats opening stanza first two lines nearly verbatim except minor changes but small enough to consider ring echo present with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases; “’Twas brindle-sharp, the O1 blade,” and “With hollow grind that sang and strayed.” Also line 6 repeats the image \"He ground it true, he ground it fine\" echoing preparation from earlier. So yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present: stanza 1 includes \"Beware the burr that nicks the steel!\", a clear caution to the protagonist. So yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: stanza 2 shows protagonist taking \"jig in hand,\" working by light shaping the blade, and stanza 3 shows continuing effort, patient grinding for hours—clear preparation before encounter. So yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: stanza 3 and 4 have a dialogic moment with the blade speaking, warning to grind true or face fate, which is a symbolic confrontation with the adversary (the burr or imperfect edge), so yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: stanza 4-5 depict the protagonist grinding and stropping until the edge passes the test, sheathing it proudly; this is a decisive act resolving the central tension of perfecting the blade’s edge, so yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: the final stanza depicts the protagonist sheathing the blade, now ground true, and the blade whispering \"Now, sharpen him.\" This ending is somewhat ambiguous - no clear jubilant celebration or homecoming, more a quiet conclusion or ongoing process. So no.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented coinages: \"brindle-sharp,\" \"O1 blade,\" \"hollow grind,\" \"jig\" (tool), \"whetstone’s hymn,\" \"burr,\" \"angles keen,\" \"stropped,\" \"sharpen\" (some common words). However, many words are fairly standard English or technical terms (stropped, burr). The coinages specific to Carroll-like nonsense words or neologisms seem fewer than 8 distinct made-up terms. Possibly borderline but likely no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Check coinage spread: most stanzas contain at least one technical or slightly novel term, but mostly standard English words describing sharpening, so likely no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>No noncanonical named creature or entity is mentioned apart from \"O1 blade\" (a steel type), which is an object, not a creature. So no.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>No onomatopoeia bursts like \"snicker-snack\" or \"Pop!\" are present in the poem. So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: some mild consonance like \"bench-light’s gleam he shaped the fray\" but nothing strong or prominent in ≥2 stanzas. So no.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning/admonition first stanza → preparation in 2nd stanza → confrontation in 3rd-4th → decisive action in 4th-5th → conclusion in final stanza. Matches canonical order. So yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line verbatim from Carroll’s original poem, wording is distinct and original. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens: does the poem use ≤8 canonical words? Some appear: \"Beware,\" \"snicker-snack\" and similar canonical words do not appear; canonical coinages such as \"brillig,\" \"slithy,\" \"toves,\" \"gyre,\" \"gimble,\" \"wabe,\" \"mimsy,\" \"borogoves,\" \"mome,\" \"raths,\" \"outgrabe,\" \"Jubjub,\" \"Bandersnatch,\" \"vorpal,\" \"manxome,\" \"Tumtum,\" \"uffish,\" \"whiffling,\" \"tulgey,\" \"burbled,\" \"snicker-snack,\" \"galumphing,\" \"beamish\" are absent except \"Beware\" (not canonical) and \"blade\" (not canonical). So canonical lexicon likely ≤8. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: lines mostly 7-9 syllables in longer lines, 5-7 in shorter lines; the alternation is subtle and not as strict as canonical but generally lines fit roughly within Jabberwocky meter (~8/6 syllables alternating). So borderline but leaning yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: end rhymes on lines 2 and 4 vary each stanza; no end word is reused more than twice excluding ring echo. So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: no single content word overused excessively; \"grind,\" \"blade,\" \"edge\" repeated but within reasonable frequency <5 times or <8%. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: fewer than 8 distinct coinages; and those present mostly center around \"grind\"/\"blade\"/\"sharp\" roots and technical terms, so likely no diverse roots. So no.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem addresses clearly the sharpening of a blade (\"O1 blade\", \"hollow grind\"), distinct subject but presented in a way reminiscent of Jabberwocky’s style and theme of battle but on a different topic. Original poem asks about the model poem style matching Jabberwocky, no topic constraint given except style matching. Since no topic was given in prompt, strict no-topic adherence check not needed. However, poem clearly addresses sharpening theme, not Jabberwocky creature/fantasy. So no.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: poem has implied motif of craftsmanship, perfection, and struggle symbolized through blade sharpening, but this is subtler and less mythic/whimsical than Jabberwocky’s subtext. Marginal but possibly yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>no</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.625, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 0.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 0.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 0.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.625, "criteria_yes": 15, "label": "medium"}

Lines are fairly similar length; no clear alternating line lengths. So this is not clearly met.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme: lines (2,4) mostly rhyme or near rhyme (sleep/alone no; fleet/street yes; hand/sill no; stood/ajar no; true/new neat yes; shut/cut yes; Box/locks yes; lied/inside yes). Only 50%+ stanzas have good rhyme on 2 and 4. AABB pattern is avoided. Rhyme on (2,4) seems partially present but not in ≥60% stanzas.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes start with similar words: begins with “And hast thou kept the letter, Box?” echoing interaction with box and letter but no ≥2 repeated content words or a refrain exactly. Some thematic echo but not a clear ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present in stanza 2: “Beware the Inkwyrm… Beware the Seal-Snatch... And shun the Blot-Beast...” meets warning/admonition criterion.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation occurs: stanza 3 describes protagonist taking pen, pausing, resting, and then penning the note with patient quill—clear preparation before action.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: The poem lacks a clear meeting or adversarial confrontation with the named threats. The Cedar sighing in stanza 4 is metaphorical and no clear meeting with Inkwyrm or Blot-Beast occurs.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive slaying or resolving act missing: no action that defeats or solves a conflict, only letter-writing and contemplation.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return or celebration absent: no jubilant or triumphant return, only leaving box and reflections on letter.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: Inkwyrm, Seal-Snatch, Blot-Beast, and \"cedar keep\" (borderline), “moan” and “whispered” and “cradled” are normal English. Only 3 clear coinages. Less than 8 distinct invented coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinages per stanza: only stanza 2 has multiple coinages; other stanzas have none or standard English words. Not every stanza has a coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creatures/entities not canonical and not Jabberwock: Inkwyrm, Seal-Snatch, Blot-Beast named and central to admonition but no creature is central to action (no encounter). So yes they are named but not central to the action.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: No words like pop, hiss, snicker-snack, or similar bursts; hinges creak might imply sound but no explicit onomatopoeic bursts appear twice.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration or consonance: Some (\"fountain-pen\", \"patient quill\", \"folded... folded neat\"), but not clearly evident or strong in multiple stanzas. Minimal alliteration beyond incidental.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning (yes, stanza 2), preparation (yes, stanza 3), encounter (no), decisive action (no), return/celebration (no). So arc beats do not appear in canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines from canonical poem observed, after normalizing quotes and whitespace.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexicon use: “brillig” appears twice, “mome” not present, “Jubjub” no, “vorpal” no, “manxome” no, “uffish” no, \"snicker-snack\" no, “beamish” no, “burble” no. Only \"brillig\" borrowed and “Beware” is common word. So canonical token count ≤8.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count tightness: Longer lines mostly around 8–9 syllables; shorter lines about 5–7 syllables, fairly close to Jabberwocky pattern. The match is approximate but acceptable since some variation normal. No major violations.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The rhyme “sleep/alone” no; “fleet/street” yes; multiple quatrains rhyme differ, ‘land/sill’ no; ‘true/new/neat’ yes; ‘shut/cut’ yes; 'Box/locks' yes; 'lied/inside' yes. Rhyme varies, no end-word repeated >2 times; good variety.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No content-word overuse beyond reason: No single content word overused more than 5 times or 8% of content words outside rings.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety low: only Inkwyrm, Seal-Snatch, Blot-Beast, three distinct roots; not ≥4 distinct roots; substantial % come from the suffixes -Snatch, -Beast, and “Inkwyrm” compounds but only 3 total.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem matches topic style (jabberwocky style poem with fantastical creatures and a narrative) though it diverges to letter-writing metaphor instead of battle. Topic assumed as \"Jabberwocky style\" so mostly yes, though no battle theme.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Metaphor about preserving letters, love, memory, time continues across poem; consistent undertone beyond surface action.

Counting distinct invented coinages not canonical: brilly, orin, zizzles, grobble, flumes, tiddleplum, sonant, whimble-stand, timbertood, carillon (borderline standard word though mostly musical term, possibly coinage here), bray (standard English, so no), trill (standard English, probably no). About 9-10 distinct coinages not canonical.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza contains at least one coinage: stanza 1 (brilly, orin, grobble, flumes), 2 (Orin, tiddleplum), 3 (vorpal, sonant, whimble-stand), 4 (Orin, timbertood, carillon), 5 (bray?), 6 (vorpal, snicker-snack replaced by shrill/thrum here), 7 (Orin Bell), 8 (brilly, grobble, peppermint rum). Except 'peppermint rum' (standard phrase) last stanza otherwise with coinage; 'brilly' and 'orin' present there.

However, 'shrill' and 'thrum' are close to onomatopoeia but arguably not exclamatory bursts like 'snicker-snack!'. Only 1 or 2 near onomatopoeic bursts; probably borderline but the poem does have at least two sound effect bursts, so yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Clear within-line alliteration in multiple stanzas, e.g. 'brilly'/'bells', 'whimble-stand'/'dreamed', 'sonant'/'sought', 'flute'/'flames', 'fuming'/'fuming tiddleplum'. So yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The canonical arc appears in order - warning in stanza 2, preparation in stanza 3, encounter in stanza 4, decisive action in stanza 5, return/celebration in stanza 6-7, ring stanza echoes 8. So arc order is correct.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines detected; wording changes throughout, and no line exactly matches the reference poem.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: The poem uses canonical words such as 'mimsy', 'vorpal', 'beamish', 'uffish', 'snicker-snack' replaced with 'shrill/thrum', 'frabjous', 'tumtum' replaced by whimble-stand, 'borogoves' replaced by grobble shells. Canonical tokens used appear limited and ≤8 distinct canonical tokens.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines are mostly 8–9 syllables, shorter lines mostly 5–7 syllables, matching Jabberwocky’s pattern; the poem maintains consistent syllable counts.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: End rhymes on (2,4) lines vary across stanzas, no end word is repeated >2 times aside from ring echo.

Needs detailed check: e.g. first stanza lines roughly 8,8,7,7 syllables with some close length. Across 8 stanzas, about 5 or 6 show reasonable alternation in syllabics and content word count differences. This seems borderline but more than 60% stanzas show some alternation.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>In ≥60% of stanzas, lines (2,4) rhyme or have slant rhyme and AABB rhyme dominance is avoided. Rhyme pairs:  \n1) brine / sly (no rhyme)  \n2) teem / deep (near rhyme, inexact but plausible slant)  \n3) sighed / grin (no rhyme)  \n4) quaffed / sting (no rhyme)  \n5) cried / tide (clear rhyme)  \n6) day / Callay (clear rhyme)  \n7) brine / grin (slant rhyme)  \nOverall, only about 3 stanzas clearly rhyme (stanza 2,5,6). So <60% rhyme not met. Also some AABB lines present but overall no clear avoidance of AABB but mostly mixed or no rhyme. So no for rhyme pattern.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza clearly repeats elements from opening stanza with several exact content words/phrases repeated: “’Twas brackish eve, and quenching brine” and “Did hiss and spurt in salted line” are echoed, also the \"slurpjaw’s grin\" motif repeated from earlier. Clear ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>First stanza contains a warning: \"Beware the Slurpjaw, slimy, sly,\" an early admonition. Satisfies warning criterion.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/arment: second stanza shows protagonist taking flask, spending time by crag, resting and observing, implying preparation and resolve before encounter. Criterion met.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter clearly happens in stanza 3 and 4: Slurpjaw approaches with \"slurpy stride\" and \"brackish breath,\" actual meeting described.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: stanza 4 and 5 describe protagonist drinking \"while Slurpjaw’s jaws behind him laughed,\" \"He turned and drained the hissing thing,\" a decisive act that \"quenched him.\" Resolves tension decisively.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return or celebration: stanza 6 and 7 describe protagonist crying \"And hast thou quenched the brine?\" and \"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\" joyful, celebratory return indicated.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Counting distinct invented coinages beyond canonical Carroll words: brackish, quenching, slurpjaw, gurgling, hissed, splash, swirl, salty, sipped, sighed, slurpy, quaffed — some words are normal English, some borderline, but distinct clear coinages or nonce words include Slurpjaw (named creature), \"slurpy,\" \"brackish\" is English but less common, \"gurgling\" is English; \"burble\" absent here. Approx 4-5 distinct neologisms: Slurpjaw, slurpy, brinish (from title), gurgling is English. Barely reaches 8 distinct coinages; more borderline, counting unique invented words carefully, safest is no (less than 8 distinct).</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Does each stanza contain ≥1 coinage? Some stanzas have only English words (e.g. stanza 6,7), so no coinages in every stanza. Fails.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature named and central: The Slurpjaw named as the adversary (non-canonical) and central to action.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"hiss,\" \"splash,\" \"swirl,\" \"hissing\" — \"hiss\" appears multiple times, \"splash\" is onomatopoeic. At least 2 onomatopoeic bursts present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Examples include “brackish eve, and quenching brine,” \"briny breaths and dripping grin,\" and “sip and sighed,” “splash! A swirl!”, at least two stanzas show clear within-line alliteration/consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order is warning (1st stanza), preparation (2nd stanza), encounter (3rd stanza), decisive action (4th stanza), return/celebration (5-7th stanzas). Arc beats appear in canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line verbatim matches canonical poem lines. All lines are novel in wording.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens ≤8: Poem uses \"vorpal,\" \"frabjous,\" \"Callooh! Callay!\" etc. No use of established canonical unique words besides those interjections; canonical tokens appear ≤8 in total, favoring new coinages.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts: longer line about 8–9 syllables, shorter about 5–7. Here lines mostly around 7-9 syllables; shorter lines near 7-8 syllables, not consistently ≤7. Meter approximate but not tight, borderline no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety across stanzas: rhymes are limited and repeated; only few rhyme pairs distinct, some repetition. Rhyme variety is low, multiple stanzas reuse same rhymes or near rhymes. So no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: no single content word repeated excessively. \"Brine\" repeated frequently but under threshold; no overuse detected.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: fewer than 8 coinages; roots limited mainly to \"slurp\" root variations (Slurpjaw, slurpy), limiting root variety. So no (less than 4 distinct roots).</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: clearly about a mythical creature encounter and battle in a Carroll-style nonsense poem, matching Jabberwocky theme and structure. Topic adherence yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: implied motif of overcoming or quenching a perilous entity (Slurpjaw), metaphor for conquering forces, consistent undertone of heroism and triumph.
