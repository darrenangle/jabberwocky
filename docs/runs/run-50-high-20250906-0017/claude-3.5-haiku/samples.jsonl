Fourth stanza: no invented word except \"galumphing\" (canonical). Fifth stanza: \"beamish\" (canonical), \"frabjous\" canonical; no new coinages.

Peonant is new. \"And hast thou slain the Peonyant?\" echoes canonical line but substituting the creature name, so canonical phrases counted but distinct tokens ≤8: beamish, galumphing, frabjous, callooh, callay, one, two, etc., probably ≤8.

Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhyme endings (lawn/sing), (child/wild/slays/ways), (stake/bright/light), (sang/rang/head/bed), (Peonyant/grant/Callay) some repeats (light/bright) once, \"head/bed,\" repeated once; variety spread sufficient, no exact word reused >2 times excluding ring. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No content word obviously overused >5 times or >8% corpus; “the” common but that is stop word; no (content word) overuse.

No end word reused more than twice excluding ring echo. So rhyme variety acceptable -> yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: content words do not appear overused.

Topic matches style and theme -> yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: underlying motif of struggle against musical or dusty interference, the struggle of the fiddler, and overcoming challenges metaphorically—as in Carroll's poem.

Meter is not perfectly ballad-like. The pattern is not very clear; syllable counts and content word count differences do not consistently alternate as in a true ballad meter. Likely no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>In at least 60% of stanzas, do lines 2 and 4 rhyme (including slant rhyme) and avoid AABB dominance? Most stanzas rhyme 2/4 (e.g., “fine/been”, “rage/within”, “hand/perplexed”, “knife/combine”, “beast/core”). The rhyme scheme seems mostly ABCB. No strong AABB dominance. Yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Does the final stanza echo the opening stanza with at least 2 repeated content words or clear refrain? The first stanza mentions “kiridashi blade,” the final stanza mentions “kiridashi gleams,” which is a repeated key coinage. No other exact repeated content words or refrains. Only one repetition strong enough. So no clear ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Is there an early admonition or caution? Second stanza says \"Beware the Khorlag's scribal rage,\" a clear admonition early on.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Does the protagonist prepare before the encounter? Third stanza is about preparing nib and steady hand; describes trembling parchment and sounds of upcoming text—clear preparation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Is there a clear encounter/confrontation? Fourth stanza: he slashes the Khorlag with a vorpal knife, a direct confrontation.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Is there a decisive act resolving central tension? Fourth stanza shows decisive slashing stroke that resolves the fractal, fell combine (the adversary). Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Is there return/celebration? Fifth stanza: “triump[rings] from west to east,” gleaming kiridashi, “silence settles to its core,” indication of celebration/return to calm. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Are there ≥8 distinct invented coinages? Coinages: scribe-bright, writhen, kiridashi, khorlag, snicks, grapheme-claws, skreeling, vorpal knife (vorpal canonical), fractal, fell combine (fell is canonical but \"combine\" as noun?), scrawling beast, kiridashi (repeated). Counting: scribe-bright, writhen, kiridashi, khorlag, snicks, grapheme-claws, skreeling, fractal, scrawling. At least 8 distinct coinages invented or modified.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza must have at least one coinage. 1st: scribe-bright, writhen, kiridashi; 2nd: Khorlag, grapheme-claws, snicks; 3rd: skreeling; 4th: vorpal knife (vorpal is canonical but knife used coinage-style), fractal, fell combine; 5th: kiridashi, scrawling beast; all stanzas contain one or more coinages. Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Is there a non-canonical creature/entity named and central? “Khorlag” is named repeatedly and is the adversary; clearly non-canonical and central.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>At least 2 onomatopoeic bursts? “Snicks and scratches” (snicks is onomatopoeic), “skreeling” is oppressive noise—but is it onomatopoeic? More like a coined verbal. No clear multiple onomatopoeic bursts like “snicker-snack!” or “Pop!”; only “snicks” stands out. Probably no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration or consonance beyond incidental in ≥2 stanzas? Examples: “scribe-bright,” “writhen line,” “gleam and glimmer,” “kiridashi blade,” “Beware the Khorlag’s scribal rage,” “snicks and scratches,” “Prepare thy nib and steady hand,” “parchment trembles,” “mystic markings,” “slashed,” “pure design,” “scrawling beast.” Alliteration/consonance is present clearly in multiple stanzas (e.g., stanza 1 and 2). Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration. The poem follows this order clearly: Admonition in stanza 2, preparation in stanza 3, encounter and decisive act in stanza 4, celebration in stanza 5. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Any verbatim matching line? Lines do not exactly replicate lines from canonical Jabberwocky. No exact verbatim matches seen.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token usage ≤8? Canonical tokens appear only in “vorpal” and “Beware,” “One, two!” and a few others. Here only “vorpal” and “Beware” from canonical. Total probably ≤5 canonical tokens, so yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines ≈8–9 syllables; shorter ≈5–7 per stanza. Checking sample:\n\n1st stanza: ’Twas scribe-bright, (3) and the writhen line (5) = 8 syllables; Did gleam and glimmer sharp and fine (7-8); The kiridashi blade so keen (7-8); Carved whispers where no script had been (8) - generally fits. But need to confirm alternating longer/shorter per stanza for ballad meter; syllables fit approx (8/6)\n\nMost stanzas follow ~8/6 pattern roughly. So yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Are rhyme endings in position 2 and 4 varied across and not reusing exact end words >2 times? Rhyme end words: fine/been, rage/within, hand/perplexed, knife/combine, beast/core. All distinct rhymes, no reuse >2 times; yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no single content word overused excessively. “Kiridashi” appears 3-4 times; “blade” once; “Khorlag” 3-4. Total content words about 80; no content word exceeds 8% (≈6-7 times). Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: ≥4 distinct roots, no suffix accounts for >50%. Coinages: scribe-bright, writhen, kiridashi, khorlag, snicks, grapheme-claws, skreeling, fractal, fell combine, scrawling beast – roots cover wide range; suffixes not dominated; yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-style combat poem with a named creature “Khorlag” and related coinage; does not stray from the theme; yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Implied subtext about writing/artistic creation (“scribe-bright,” “kiridashi blade,” “inkblot tendrils,” “parchment trembles”) as metaphor for creative struggle, battle with the “scribal rage” Khorlag, resolved by artful design, and celebrations. Coherent undertone present.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.875, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.875, "criteria_yes": 21, "label": "high"}
