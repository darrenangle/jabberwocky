This counts as a strong ring composition (full echo with ≥2 repeated content phrases).</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present in first stanza: \"Beware the Grindlesnark... Avoid... And shun...\" clearly a warning.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation present in the third stanza where protagonist takes vulcan wrench, seeks crucial tool, rests by stand, and thinks in thought—showing tool preparation and mental readying.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter present in fourth stanza: Grindlesnark comes \"whiffling through the molten wood\" and \"scritched\" as it comes, a clear meeting/confrontation setup.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action in fifth stanza: \"One, two! One, two! And through and through / The setting rod went snicker-snack! / He quenched the beast...\" indicating a killing or resolution act.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration in sixth stanza: questioning \"And hast thou slain...?\", \"Come to my arms...\", joyous expressions \"O frabjous day! O stark remark!\", chortling in joy, indicating celebratory return.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Counting distinct invented coinages: Grindlesnark, Ebonite, feed-heats, vulcan, Heatwell, tulgid, scritched, setting rod, plume-smoke, brimful (borderline common word but used poetically here), stark remark (less so). There appear to be at least 8 distinct coinages or nonce compounds not canonical.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage, e.g. Grindlesnark (1st), Ebonite, feed-heats, vulcan wrench, Heatwell stand, tulgid thought, scritched, setting rod, noxious plume-smoke, brimful, stark remark (last few may overlap close to the end). Each stanza has >1 invented word or compound or nonce term.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Grindlesnark is a non-canonical creature name central to the poem's action and conflict, distinct from Jabberwock.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts: \"snicker-snack!\" clearly present once; \"scritched\" is a sound-implying verb coined here, could be counted as noise word; \"whiffling\" canonical but present. Total onomatopoeic bursts ≥2 is borderline because only \"snicker-snack\" clearly onomatopoeic; \"scritched\" somewhat onomatopoeic but may be borderline. Since strictness demands clear ≥2 bursts, answer no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance within at least 2 stanzas: \"jaws that crunch, claws that snare\", \"feed-heats' flaming flare\"; \"protagonist took his vulcan wrench\"; \"whiffling through the molten wood\"; these show clear alliteration or consonance beyond incidental repetition in multiple stanzas.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc beats follow canonical order: warning first stanza → preparation third stanza → encounter fourth stanza → decisive action fifth stanza → return/celebration sixth stanza → ring echo final stanza. Order preserved.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line verbatim matches from the canonical \"Jabberwocky\" poem. The ring echo stanza is identical to first stanza but does not reproduce canonical lines; it is original text repeated. So no verbatim canonical lines present.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used: jaws, claws, whiffling, snicker-snack, beamish, frabjous, chortled appear not at all; some canonical words replaced (\"snicker-snack\" used, canonical; \"whiffling\" present; \"O frabjous day\" canonical phrase appears but \"O stark remark\" is a coinage variant); The canonical tokens count is ≤8 and acceptable.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts: Longer lines mostly around 8–9 syllables (e.g., \"Long time the crucial tool he sought–\" is 8 syllables), shorter lines ~5–7 (\"He took his vulcan wrench in hand:\" 7 syllables). Nearly all quatrains fit the ~8/6 syllable pattern; meets tightness.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>(2,4) rhyme variety: rhymes for lines 2 and 4 vary (flare/snare, sought/thought, flame/became, snicker-snack/back, boy/remark, flare/snare repeated in ring stanza). \"flare\" rhyme repeated multiple times but only twice outside ring echo, fitting fair variety without overuse >2 times. Rhyme variety acceptable.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition outside ring echo: No single content word overused excessively; \"Grindlesnark\", \"flare\", \"snare\" repeat but within limits; no serious lexical repetition problem.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show variety of distinct roots: Grindle-, Ebon-, feed-heat, vulcan, Heatwell, tulgid, scritch-, setting rod, plume-smoke, brimful, stark remark. No single suffix dominates; coinage variety good with ≥4 roots.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly about the Grindlesnark creature and its slaying, matching the style and theme of Jabberwocky. Does not drift to unrelated subjects.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Cautionary motif, struggle and victory over adversity, the cyclical nature of the warning (echoed last stanza).

Ring echo satisfied.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present: 2nd stanza contains \"Beware the Flimflag, my dear son!\" with cautionary phrases.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation and armament: Protagonist takes \"vorpal ice-axe firm,\" seeks the mount and rests \"by a twisted thurm,\" showing planning/preparation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter/confrontation: Protagonist meets Flimflag \"with eyes of flamey red,\" in snowy wood; clear meeting described.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: The \"vorpal blade went snicker-snack!\" and \"He left it dead,\" shows a clear decisive act resolving the conflict.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Protagonist returns with Flimflag’s head; someone chortles in joy; final stanza celebrates victory with flags dancing and singing—return and celebration present.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: Distinct invented coinages identified include slimmery, windle-wuthers, flimflag, gurglebird, bandersnap, thurm, thinkling, toftish, flamey, galumphed; counting at least 9 distinct, exceeding 8.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza has ≥1 coinage: \"slimmery,\" \"windle-wuthers,\" \"flimflag,\" \"gurglebird,\" \"bandersnap,\" \"thurm,\" \"thinkling,\" \"toftish,\" \"flamey,\" \"galumphed,\" \"wag\" (different from standard). Spread is good.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named centrally: \"Flimflag,\" a clear invented creature analogous to Jabberwock, also \"Gurglebird\" and \"Bandersnap\" (variants of canonical words). Flimflag is central adversary.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Includes \"snicker-snack!\" echoing canonical example; also \"cracked with mighty squeak;\" \"whiffling\" and \"burbled\" are canonical. Only one clear new onomatopoeic burst though \"squeak\" is borderline; \"snicker-snack\" is canonical.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration and consonance: Several stanzas show notable alliteration—e.g., \"windle-wuthers,\" \"mighty squeak,\" \"flimflag fingers\" (implied), \"twisted thurm,\" \"thinkling thought.\" At least 2 stanzas meet this.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning admonition → Preparation with armament → Encounter → Decisive action → Return and celebration appear in proper sequence.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No exact verbatim lines from the canonical poem detected. Some close phrases but wording sufficiently changed and no exact line matches after normalization.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used are under or equal to 8: \"vorpal,\" \"whiffling,\" \"burbled,\" \"snicker-snack,\" \"beamish,\" \"frumious\" all appear (canonical count approx 6-7), which meets criterion favoring new coinages alongside canonical.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Strict syllable pattern: Longer lines mostly 8-9 syllables, shorter lines mostly 5-7 syllables, consistent with Jabberwocky’s ~8/6 pattern across all stanzas.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes vary from stanza to stanza; end words not heavily reused (>2 times), helping variety. Some repeated rhyme sounds but final stanza rhymes differ from opening avoiding monotony.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No single content word overused; common content words have low frequency; no overuse exceeding limits.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages have at least 4 distinct roots, e.g., flimflag, gurgle, bander, windle, thurm, think, flame, galump. No one root or suffix dominates >50%.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly focuses on a Jabberwocky-style creature \"Flimflag\" and related narrative, matching original poem's topic style without deviation.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem conveys undertones of facing fears, courage, spiritual quest (mountain peak, prayer flags), and triumph; clear coherent implied motif beyond surface action.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.9583333333333334, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.9583333333333334, "criteria_yes": 23, "label": "high"}

However, actual word-for-word identical lines? “One, two! One, two! And through and through The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!” is identical except 'blade' instead of canonical 'blade' (matches). “He left it dead, and with its head He went galumphing back.” is verbatim canonical line except replacing \"Jabberwock\" with \"Plane Throat\" but line’s content words identical. However strict policy is exact line matching string including substitutions considered different. So no exact verbatim canonical lines because creatures are different, and small word substitutions. But caution: “Beware the Plane Throat, my son!” is similar to “Beware the Jabberwock, my son!” but not exact line. So no verbatim lines — yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: canonical tokens used are “vorpal,” “manxome,” “whiffling,” “tumtum” replaced as “Tandan,” “snicker-snack,” “galumphing,” “beamish,” “frumious” (as in “frumious Throttlebur”), and “mimsy” missing. Number of distinct canonical tokens ≤8 is true — yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts: Check longer ~8–9, shorter ~5–7 per stanza line pattern. Most stanzas maintain roughly Jabberwocky’s pattern, e.g. “Beware the Plane Throat, my son!” (6 syllables?), “The jaws that gnash, the wings that whirr!” (8 syllables). Some variants (e.g., “And as in slithy thought he stood,” short line as well). Pattern generally maintained in ≥60% stanzas — yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) end rhymes over stanzas mostly different: son/shun, sought/thought, flame/came, snicker-snack/back, boy/callay. Final stanza weaker rhyme (son/whirr in first two lines repeated). No end word reused >2 times besides refrain line. So rhyme variety is tended to be good — yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No single content word excessively repeated; “Beware” appears 3 times but under 5; “Plane,” “Throat” appear often as names but content word repetition within allowed limits — yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages include multiple distinct roots: “Plane,” “Throat,” “Zibblezox,” “Throttlebur,” “Tandan,” “Krenovian,” “tulgy” (variant spelling). At least 4 distinct roots — yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly addresses the creature “Plane Throat” and follows the Jabberwocky style of narrative of a son warned, preparation, confrontation, slaying, return. So yes, topic adherence is good.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond surface, some implied familiar motif of heroic quest, coming of age, and cautionary warning with undertone of danger and triumph—detectable but limited complexity — yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.875, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.875, "criteria_yes": 21, "label": "high"}
