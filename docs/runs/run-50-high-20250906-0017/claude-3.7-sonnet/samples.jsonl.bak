With crystal blade\nThe vorstal rod went snipper-snap!\nHe left it dead, and with its head\nHe glooped back to his lap.\n\n\"And hast thou slain the Burnenfade?\nCome to my arms, my bleamish boy!\nO crepulous day! Hoozbray! Hoozbray!\"\nHe chortled in his joy.\n\nBeware the Burnenfade, my son!\nThe lights that split, the grades that gleam!\nBeware the Focusnatch, and run\nFrom shadows that can dream!", "info": {}}

Snick-snack! With steady hand\nThe scribing blade sliced true and clean!\nIt carved the line so nobly planned\nWhere no line yet had been.\n\nAnd having scored the perfect mark,\nHe sought the master craftsman's eye.\n\"And hast thou traced thy guideline stark?\nCome glimmer here, my spry!\"\n\nBeware the kiridashi, my son!\nThe blades that slice, the points that score!\nThe scribing edge that marks where none\nHave dared to mark before!", "info": {}}
