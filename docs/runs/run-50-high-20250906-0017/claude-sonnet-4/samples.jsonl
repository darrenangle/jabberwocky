No line exactly matches canonical poem. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used: “mimsy,” “frumious,” “beamish,” “snicker-snack,” “burbled,” “galumphing,” “outgrabe.” Count ~7 canonicals. Less or equal to 8 canonical tokens; so yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Line lengths syllable count roughly follows Jabberwocky’s pattern: longer lines 8–9 syllables, shorter lines 5–7 syllables; consistent throughout all quatrain stanzas. So yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety across stanzas: rhyme words at position 2 and 4 mostly unique per stanza with no more than 2 repeats of same rhyme word across poem, e.g., “catch/shun” vs “sought/thought.” So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word is overused outside ring echo. Words like “Bubblywock,” “blade,” “thought” occur multiple times but do not exceed 5 total or 8% threshold.

So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-style battle against the “Bubblywock,” following same thematic subject as Jabberwocky (creature hunt/adventure). So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: the poem suggests an allegory on baking or fermentation (“yeasty spores,” “kneading,” “glutenous thought,” “rising stand”) beyond surface violence.
