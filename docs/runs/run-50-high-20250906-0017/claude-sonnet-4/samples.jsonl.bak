One, two! And through and through\nThe gripping blade went snicker-snack!\nHe left it dead, and with its rue\nHe went galumphing back.\n\n\"And hast thou slain the scribbling beast?\nCome to my arms, my craftsman boy!\nO frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\"\nHe chortled in his joy.\n\n'Twas brillig when the scriblings came\nA-scratching through the pergament,\nAll mimsy were the inklings' flame,\nAnd mome raths outgrabe their lament.", "info": {}}
