Come / To my arms, my beamish boy! … He chortled in his joy.” Clear return and rejoicing.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: “slutch-grown,” “Tresklave,” “Slurch-bird,” “G'rumble-Snarl,” “snicker-glaive,” “sleevon-stand,” “slorny vext,” “snarfled,” “slubbed,” “gumber-pack” — 10+ distinct invented coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza has at least one coinage: e.g., “slutch-grown,” “Tresklave,” “snicker-glaive,” “sleevon-stand,” “slorny vext,” “snarfled,” “slubbed,” “gumber-pack,” “Galumphash glum” (in stanza 7). Thus yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creature distinct from canonical Jabberwock: Tresklave and G'rumble-Snarl (also Slurch-bird) are new creatures, with Tresklave central to narrative.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: “Snicker-snack!” repeated and “scritching” and “snarfled” can be considered onomatopoeic bursts; “snicker-snack” is canonical onomatopoeia reused here. At least 2 onomatopoeic bursts present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: multiple lines with notable alliteration in at least two stanzas such as “slutch-grown slopes,” “seethe and simmer,” “scritching through the slorny vext.” At least 2 stanzas have clear alliteration.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive action → return/celebration all present and appear in canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: The poem repeats exact phrases of the opening stanza but these are slightly altered (“brillig” → “evening-soft,” “slutch-grown slopes” instead of “slithy toves”). The final stanza is identical to first stanza except the first stanza is original, final stanza repeats first stanza. The final stanza is identical to first stanza, so no verbatim canonical lines, and no exact lines from canonical poem; repeated lines are original poem’s first stanza repeated here, so original content without verbatim borrow from canonical text’s lines. So yes, no canonical verbatim lines.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: canonical tokens appear kept ≤8, with only “manxome,” “frumious,” “snicker-snack,” “beamish,” “chortled” reused, but majority are new. So yes, canonical token count under 8.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines mostly near 8–9 syllables, shorter lines near 5–7. Many stanzas approximate the jabberwocky ~8/6 pattern. Likely yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: end rhymes (2,4) vary without excessive repeats; no end word reused more than twice except ring echo, so yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no obvious overuse of a single content word >5 times or >8% of content words outside ring echo; coinages and synonyms spread. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages have diverse roots and suffixes (slutch, Tresk-, Slurch-, G'rumble-, snicker-glaive, sleevon, slorny, snarfled, slubbed, gumber-pack); no single suffix >50% of coinages. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem matches style and subject similar to Jabberwocky (fantastical creature hunt, invented creatures and words), naming a creature and telling the hunt story without changing topic; topic clearly adhered.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: strong traditional motif of caution, heroism, overcoming danger and return; implied undertones of father-son relationship and rite of passage clearly detectable.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.9583333333333334, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.9583333333333334, "criteria_yes": 23, "label": "high"}
