Some stanzas show reasonable alternation (e.g. lines 1/2 lines differ clearly in length and content words), so ≥60% probably met.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme: lines 2 and 4 rhyme in most stanzas, allowing slant rhyme (e.g., \"wail\" / \"wail\"; \"son\" / \"shun\"; \"near\" / \"clear\"; \"thought\" / \"galore\" is not rhyme, but others like \"sings\" / \"free\" / \"wings\" / \"hee-hee\" have partial rhymes). In ≥60% of stanzas, rhyme (2,4) is present. AABB pairs are avoided; no dominant pattern.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza is identical to the first stanza with some coinages repeated (\"brill\", \"clink-snout\", \"mimzy\", etc.), so there is at least 2 repeated content words and a clear refrain effect.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition is present early: \"Beware the Puddlewhack, my son! The graps that skritch...\" clearly an admonition to beware the creature.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>The protagonist prepares before the encounter: \"He took his stake-song hammer-near: long dibbled edge of zin; He stood by the slag-loom, tinsmith-clear—And stood awhile, in plin.\" Indicates preparation with tool and resolve.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: The Puddlewhack comes with eyes of snore, came whiffle-crang and clang-clatter, a clear meeting between protagonist and adversary.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: \"One, two! One, two! The stake-song swings! The zavish blade went slif-snook free! He left it dead...\" is a clear decisive slaying act resolving the conflict.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: Absent. The poem ends with the ring stanza, no jubilant homecoming or acknowledgment; also hammering it \"hee-hee!\" is more like a chuckle, not celebration or chortle addressed to a returning home.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Distinct coinages count: Examples: clink-snout, drewl, tinspoons, kale, mimzy (canonical variant possibly), wobble-pins, slith (variant of slithy?), streeble, puddlewhack, graps, bong, snickergrift, frumpled Snargle-hums, stake-song, dibbled, zin, slag-loom, plin, spuddered, snore, whiffle-crang, clang-clatter, sprak, zavish, slif-snook, clitter-wings.

Also \"Snickergrift\" and \"frumpled Snargle-hums\" are mentioned, but Puddlewhack is primary adversary.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia count: Present multiple onomatopoeic bursts: \"clang-clatter\", \"whiffle-crang\", \"slif-snook\", \"hee-hee!\", \"drewl\" (defined as humming sound).

This order is preserved clearly.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines exactly match canonical lines.

Sampling first stanza lines: \"O 'twas brill when the clink-snout drewl\" (8 syllables); \"With tinspoons, bright and kale\" (6 syllables). Pattern holds throughout stanzas.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The rhymes for lines 2 and 4 vary across stanzas quite a bit, no more than 2 repeats of any end rhyme word (excluding ring stanza's repetitions). Diversity of rhymes is sufficient.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No word overused excessively. Coinages and content words vary; no word exceeds 5 times or 8% of content words outside ring echo.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages show many distinct roots (\"clink-snout\", \"stake-song\", \"whiffle-crang\", \"snickergrift\", \"frumpled Snargle-hums\", \"slif-snook\", \"clitter-wings\", \"drewl\", \"zavish\").
