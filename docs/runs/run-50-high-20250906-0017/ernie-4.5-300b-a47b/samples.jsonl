So no clear ring composition in final stanza echoing the first stanza with at least 2 repeated content words.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition: The poem's first stanza begins with \"Beware the Crosstie’s creosote scent,\" which is a clear cautionary warning to the protagonist, fulfilling this criterion.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>The second stanza shows preparation: \"With yoopes in hand and guggle-swat sworn,\" indicates protagonist equips tools and prepares before confrontation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>The third stanza depicts the encounter: \"The Snorgle roared... Its Plipper-tail sent treetops low,\" showing a clear meeting between protagonist and adversary (the Snorgle creature).</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Fourth stanza describes decisive action: \"A Yoke-smite blow! Its ribs were splintered,\" and the beast's struggle and final sound \"plumba,\" indicating a conclusive victory over the creature.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Fifth stanza is the return and celebration: protagonist returns \"Back o’er the Faum,\" the scent \"is sent\" no longer a warning, and \"The world wore flame, I’d saved the *quest*,\" expressing triumph and homecoming.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented coinages excluding canonical lexicon: Snorgle, Blibber-blub, Axxletrack, Zigglefog, yoopes, guggle-swat, Thistlewood, Grumble-gleam, Sporn-trees, crewkeep, skizzic, Plipper-tail, goggle-bloom, Yinke’d, Yoke-smite, Vurgle-vein, plumba, Faum, Bloot-hush, Jixxle-throng. Clearly ≥8 distinct coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage: e.g. st1 (Snorgles, Blibber-blub, Axxletrack, Zigglefog), st2 (yoopes, guggle-swat, Thistlewood, crewkeep), st3 (Snorgle, skizzic, Plipper-tail, goggle-bloom), st4 (Yoke-smite, Yinke’d, Vurgle-vein, plumba), st5 (Faum, quest [possibly standard but here used as coinage]), st6 (Snorgle, Vurgle-vein, goggle-bloom, Yinke, Bloot-hush, Jixxle-throng, skizzic). So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creature is the \"Snorgle,\" which is non-canonical and central to the action.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeic bursts: \"skizzic\" (used twice), \"plumba\"; these are coinage onomatopoeias. No other obvious onomatopoeia like ‘snicker-snack’ but \"skizzic\" definitely qualifies; count 2 such bursts.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/allusion in multiple stanzas: e.g., \"Snorgles snort in sullen,\" \"Blibber-blub claws,\" \"guggle-swat sworn,\" \"Grumble-gleam,\" \"Sporn-trees,\" and \"Bloot-hush and Jixxle-throng\" show clear and deliberate alliteration/consonance in multiple stanzas (at least two stanzas).

Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: The poem uses no direct lines from Carroll's poem; all coinages and phrasing differ. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens: No use of canonical terms like brillig, toves, jabberwock, burbled, etc. (except \"Beware\" which is English) and nothing from the canonical poem's lexicon strongly present. Canonical tokens including common English words is fine but referencing canonical invented lexicon is zero. So distinct canonical tokens ≤8, yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Check syllable counts: Longer lines mostly ≈8–9 syllables: e.g. stanza 1 lines 1 and 3 have 8+ syllables, lines 2 and 4 shorter (6-7 syllables).

Yes for syllable tightness.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Lines (2,4) rhyme varies across stanzas: scent/descent, sworn/forlorn, weak/slime (some slant), splintered/wintered, bent/sent/jest/quest (variation and not repetitive). No end word repeated >2 times except a few coinages used differently but overall rhyme variety is maintained. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No single content word (excluding coinages) is overused excessively or dominant. No overuse detected. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages have multiple distinct roots: Snorgle, Blibber-blub, Axxletrack, yoopes, guggle-swat, Grumble-gleam, Sporn-trees, Skizzic, Plipper-tail, Yinke, Yoke-smite, Vurgle-vein, plumba, etc., no suffix dominates half of coinages. More than 4 distinct roots. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>The poem clearly addresses the topic: a fantastical confrontation with a named creature \"Snorgle\" similar in style and arc to Jabberwocky. Topic adherence is clear.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem presents a thematic subtext of confronting fears/danger, and voyage through a dark night, possibly symbolic struggle, conveyed via mythic and sonic motifs.

So 9 stanzas total, which is above the 5–8 limit; also not all stanzas are quatrains since stanza 1 and stanza 9 and 10 are overlapping? Actually, the poem has 10 stanzas counting carefully (some with 4 lines, stanza 1 to stanza 10). Therefore, total stanza count exceeds 8; not all stanzas verified as quatrains—some stanzas like stanza 3 have 4 lines, but stanza 1 and stanza 9? Verify carefully line counts per stanza. Close reading: stanza boundaries may be ambiguous because of the interjection style—overall, the poem mostly consists of quatrains except the stanza with the line \"One swift jab with the Trowel's point! (Deflected force, with cunning joint!)\" which has 2 lines combined in one stanza? 2 lines possible, but here the whole stanza seems to be four lines: \"One swift jab with the Trowel's point! (Deflected force, with cunning joint!) Did ever monster make such noise? It fractured, splintered, crashed, my boys!\" That stanza has 4 lines if split carefully? It's run together. So all stanzas have 4 lines. The total stanza count appears to be 10, which is >8, thus fails <C2>. Also slightly ambiguous but likely fails.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Examination of meter for ballad meter pattern (alternating lines of ~8–9 syllables and ~5–7 syllables with significant content word difference) in at least 60% of stanzas: Some stanzas have alternating line lengths, but overall the meter is inconsistent and somewhat loose.

Rhyme on 2 and 4 mostly present though some slant rhymes occur. No excessive AABB dominance. Satisfactory for ≥60% stanzas.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes first stanza with ≥2 repeated content words or clear refrain: Final stanza repeats \"BewARE the Pantograph,\" similar to first stanza's \"BewARE the Pantograph, my son!\" Also references the tool Trowel and warnings, echoing early phrases.

Some stanzas, like the third stanza, include \"Zoodland,\" \"Trowel,\" etc. Seems consistent across stanzas.

All stanzas are quatrains except one with 6 lines (\"He took his braxwood gouge in hand:...He lurp’d, his heart with squibs distraught.\" is 4 lines; check carefully: first stanza 4 lines, second stanza 4 lines, third stanza 4 lines, fourth stanza 4 lines, fifth stanza 4 lines, sixth stanza 4 lines, seventh stanza 4 lines, eighth stanza 4 lines — yes, they are all quatrains. Total stanza count 8 within 5-8 range. So yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Checking ballad meter pattern (long/short alternation with ≥2 content-word difference): Some stanzas show alternating line lengths as in Jabberwocky, e.g., longer and shorter lines alternate. But syllable counts suggest borderline cases: mostly lines around 8 or 9 and 5-7 syllables. But need percentage ≥60% for stanzas. Rough scan: Majority show alternating longer/shorter lines with appropriate content-word difference. So yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (2,4) pairs: Most stanzas have 2nd and 4th lines rhyming or near rhyme (\"weeds\"/\"beeds\", \"claw\"/\"draw\", \"hand\"/\"land\", \"gloam\"/\"home\", \"quake\"/\"slake\", \"Ho!\"/\"bare\" - a bit of a slant there?), \"free\"/\"thee\"). No dominance of AABB in any stanza. Overall ≥60% stanzas with (2,4) rhyme present. So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza echoes the first with shared phrase structure \"’Twas frabbly, and the slithy spores / Did gyre and gimble\". Contains repeated words \"’Twas frabbly\", \"slithy spores\", \"gyre and gimble\", and similar structure. So yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Presence of early warning/admonition: In 2nd stanza, \"Beware the Fisgimous, my child! / Its fangstile jaws the drenchclouts claw; / Beware the Jibberlatch, and wild / The whistling womp that gnaws the draw!” This is a clear warning to the protagonist. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before encounter: In the 3rd stanza, \"He took his braxwood gouge in hand; / Long time the flinchsome thing he sought; / Through blorning reeds and spumy land / He lurp’d, his heart with squibs distraught.\" This signifies the protagonist taking a weapon and seeking the foe, thus a clear preparation. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter with adversary: The 4th stanza clearly describes the encounter, \"A-sudden—*snither*!—through the gloam, / The Fisgimous, with eyes like coals, / Its fishtail flounced, and swept its home— / A fritch of scales, a roar that rolls!\" Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action resolving tension: The 5th stanza \"The gouge, with sweep, struck flinch to quake, / Its jaws agape, the beast let fall; / The blaze of veins began to slake— / *Plunk!*—went the heart into his shawl.\" The protagonist strikes and kills the creature decisively. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: The 6th stanza \"O frabjous day!” he choraled, “Ho! / The Fisgimous lies stilled, laid bare!” / His poches jingled where he’d go— / The womp’s last hiss hung in the air.\" Celebration is evident; and the final stanza shows return echo.

So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>A non-canonical creature/entity is named and central: \"Fisgimous\" is the main creature clearly central to the poem's narrative action. \"Jibberlatch\" and \"womp\" also noted but \"Fisgimous\" is the main adversary. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"*snither*!\" in stanza 4 and \"*Plunk!*\" in stanza 5 clearly onomatopoeic bursts. That's 2+ onomatopoeic instances. Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Stanza 1 has \"frabbly\" and \"slithy spores\", \"gyre and gimble\" (although \"gyre\" and \"gimble\" are canonical, the repetition is strong alliteration). In stanza 2 \"fangstile jaws\", \"drenchclouts claw\". Stanza 3 \"flinchsome thing\". Multiple stanzas have clear alliteration. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc beats - warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration appear in canonical order in stanzas 2 (warning), 3 (preparation), 4 (encounter), 5 (decisive action), 6 & 7 (return). Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line exactly matches the canonical poem; coinages and structure differ from reference. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used: \"slithy\", \"gyre\", \"gimble\", \"mimzy\" (mimsy variant), \"Jibberlatch\" is coinage but echo of Bandersnatch. \"The Fisgimous\" and others are new coinages. Canonical lexicon is used ≤8 distinct tokens: \"slithy\", \"gyre\", \"gimble\", \"mimzy/mimzy\", \"mome\" not used, \"borogoves\" not used, \"outgrabe\" not used, \"Jubjub\" not used, \"Bandersnatch\" not used. So total canonical words ≤8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness check: Jabberwocky uses roughly 8–9 syllables in longer lines and 5–7 in shorter lines. Sampling stanza 1: lines 1: 7 or 8? (\"’Twas frabbly,\" = 3; \"and the slithy spores\"= 5 → total 8 syllables.) lines 2: 7? Ok. lines alternate with 8/6 or similar pattern mostly. Majority of stanzas fit this pattern consistently. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety across stanzas: (2,4) rhyme words are all different except first and last stanza both use \"beeds\" and \"weeds\" or near and \"free\" and \"thee\" in stanza 8, acceptable as a ring rhyme. No end word reused >2 times outside ring. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No content word is repeated excessively outside the ring echo. Coinages are varied, and no single content word dominates beyond permitted frequency. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Several distinct roots: \"frabbly\", \"froth-knot\", \"moth-fog\", \"fangstile\", \"drenchclouts\", \"Jibberlatch\", \"womp\", \"braxwood\", \"flinchsome\", \"blorning\", \"lurp’d\", \"squibs\", \"snither\", \"fritch\", \"poches\". No single suffix dominates majority (>50%). Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses the Jabberwocky-style nonsense battle theme, naming an invented monster (Fisgimous) and resembling the original poem's subject and structure. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is implied undertone of a heroic quest, a coming-of-age or challenge, and triumph over adversity, consistent with the original poem's deeper sense beyond surface action. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 1.0, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 1.0, "criteria_yes": 24, "label": "high"}

I thwipped—a clang!—its snickersnare\nRecoiled, then spat a *garnish-glare*.\n\n*“Flee!*” the letter chortled (that sly skin),\n*“Its janglejolt will rend your kin!”*\nBut thwip met thrum in twirled retreat—\nA flick! A snatch! The beast lay neat.\n\nIts hide, a quilt of shadow’s scowl,\nI wrapped the scroll and climbed the tow’r.\nThe cedar box, now still, its snail\nHeld peace—or was it *snare*’s frail veil?\n\nYet in the gloom, the Conumdrix’s snort\nEchoed: *“Janglejolt! Grumblesnort!”*—\nA dirge, a dare, a fey refrain.\nThe letter’s truths? Both bless and bane.\n\nBack to the vale where gloomwark fades,\nI clasped the box, its snail unmade.\nThe Conumdrix slept… or feigned its grave?\nOnly the cedar’s whisper gave:\n\n*“Beware the scroll, the snickerboot,\nThe snare you sought, the beast’s pursuit.\nFor cedar’s snail and janglejolt\nAre twin-born kin—both friends and fault.”*", "info": {"topic": "letter kept in a cedar box"}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>Title is present as a distinct line before the first stanza: \"The Cedar-Clasped Conumdrix\".</C1_think>\n<C2_think>The poem has 7 stanzas, all quatrains (4 lines each), satisfying stanza count 5-8 and quatrain structure.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Alternation of longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content-word difference occurs clearly in most stanzas (5 out of 7), meeting ≥60% criterion.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>In 5 out of 7 stanzas, lines 2 and 4 rhyme or slant rhyme; no dominance of AABB rhyme scheme, mostly ABAB or similar; meets ≥60% criterion.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes opening content words/phrases moderately with repeated \"Beware,\" \"snickerboot,\" \"snare,\" \"janglejolt,\" thematic refrains; qualifies as ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early warning/admonition is present in first stanza (line 4: \"Beware the Conumdrix line!\") and is echoed later.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Protagonist prepares with \"With sword of thwip (its blade a whorl), And snickerboot’s gleam, I braced to swirl.\" before encounter stanza; shows tool and resolve preparation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter happens in stanza 5, \"Deep in the gloom, the Conumdrix loomed,\" followed by action against the creature.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive act presented with \"A flick!

The stanzas vary in length from 4 to more, with some containing 6 lines or more. Therefore, the quatrain shape (all stanzas 4 lines) is not met, though stanza count is within 5-8.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Lines do not clearly alternate long/short by ≥2 content words systematically. The stanza line lengths and word counts seem more even or variable without consistent ballad meter line length patterns. Thus under 60% of stanzas do not show this clear alternation.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>End rhymes appear varied, but the poem uses more of ABAB or CDCD rhyme schemes rather than clear rhyme always on lines (2,4). The requested pattern for lines (2,4) to rhyme in ≥60% of stanzas is not fully satisfied. Also, no clear avoidance of AABB dominance is relevant as AABB is rarely used.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>There is no evident ring composition or refrained stanza that echoes the opening stanza with at least 2 repeated words or phrases. The final stanza reflects on the tale but does not repeat content words/phrases from the first stanza strongly enough.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>There is an explicit admonition early: the Tink warns \"Beware!\" with a clear caution about the creature’s fire.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>The poem depicts preparation and armament: forging a shield, gathering \"lensish ore and crundleflam,\" and packing \"fervorglow,\" showing definite preparation before the encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>There is a clear encounter/confrontation: the Fizznary rears with a roar, and the protagonist(s) respond with weapons and actions.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action is visible: they \"hurled the glowren,\" broke the beast’s note with a *sparklebite*, effectively slaying or taming the Fizznary.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration occur: the borendorfs rest, the Tink smiles, the beast’s fire is \"outsung,\" and there is a communal celebration \"chant of fervorglow’s applause.\"</C10_think>\n<C11_think>More than 8 distinct invented coinages appear, for example: sundiglooms, glinty焰, fervorglow, splinterpride, lensish, zozzled, shahters, glowren, shiverheart, splittergilt, crundleflam, twizzled, rimechimes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Every stanza contains at least one coinage, such as \"sundiglooms,\" \"fervorglow,\" \"glinty焰,\" \"rimechimes,\" \"sparklebite,\" \"shahters,\" \"splittergilt,\" etc.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>The poem names and centers on a non-canonical creature: the *Fizznary* is the focal adversary of the poem.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>There are at least two onomatopoeic bursts or sound-imitative words: \"roar like shahters\" and \"*sparklebite* broke its note\" (sparklebite is somewhat onomatopoeic), also \"rimechimes\" and \"hissed\" or \"sigh\" are suggested sound effects, but to be safe at least two clear bursts present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Several stanzas contain strong alliteration and consonance, e.g., \"Borendorfs blinked in sundiglooms,\" \"twizzled skies met glowermune,\" \"Pack fervorglow, wield splinterpride,\" and \"zozzled clouds spun rimechimes,\" showing clear alliteration beyond incidental repeats.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>The narrative arc follows canonical order cleanly: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration, confirmed by stanza progression and events described.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line matches any line exactly from the canonical 'Jabberwocky,' after normalization (including no reuse of \"’Twas brillig…\" or any canonical lines).</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens are not explicitly mentioned; however, the poem seems to avoid using canonical Jabberwocky words based on the text given; barely any are reused, likely ≤8 tokens total, favoring new coinages.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Lines are largely longer than in Jabberwocky and lack the tight ~8/6 syllable rhythm per alternating lines; also stanzas are not always quatrains, making the pattern impossible to fully apply. Syllable tightness is not met.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>End rhymes appear varied, mostly ABAB or CDCD schemes with different rhymes every stanza, no rhyme end-word repeated more than twice; so rhyme variety is good.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No overuse of single content words outside of possible ring echo since no ring echo is present. Lexical repetition is acceptable.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show a variety of roots: suffixes and prefixes are varied; no single coined suffix dominates over 50%. More than 4 distinct root patterns are evident.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem clearly addresses subject akin to 'Jabberwocky': a tale of a battle with a strange magical creature and hero’s journey, fitting the topic perfectly.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext of perseverance and overcoming chaos is consistent and implied throughout, giving an underlying motif besides surface action.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.7916666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.7916666666666666, "criteria_yes": 19, "label": "medium"}

Closer look: poem block shows 12 lines with breaks after every 4 lines except the last few lines run on? Actually, the poem breaks into 7 visible stanzas of exactly 4 lines each. Total stanza count =7, all quatrains, which falls into 5–8 inclusive. So yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter requires alternating longer/shorter lines in ≥60% stanzas with ≥2 content-word difference. Many lines end in 6–9 syllables. Checking line lengths roughly: lines alternate fairly well (for example, stanzas show alternating line length and content word load). At least 5 of 7 stanzas have noticeably alternating line lengths/weight. So yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme requires ≥60% stanzas have 2nd and 4th lines rhyming (including slant rhyme), and no dominant AABB. Rhyme pairs seem present in most stanzas (keen/shine, deed/draw, line/sign, drift/gift, glare/quake, away/decay...). No AABB dominance. Likely yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition requires final stanza echoing the opening stanza with 2+ repeated content words or clear refrain. Last stanza references \"kiridashi\" and \"foon\" echoing first stanza's \"Kiridashi\" and \"foon,\" plus the motif of \"scribe\" and \"dance.\" At least 2 repeated coined content words: kiridashi, foon. Yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present: first stanza includes \"Beware the Kiridashi,\" and second stanza repeats \"Beware the glimshrie! Take heed.\" So yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament present before encounter: second stanza has \"Prepare thy bromblen blade and thy quick-witted deed,\" third stanza continues with \"Arm thyself, scribe! Clasp the kiridashi’s line.\" So yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation evident: fourth stanza introduces the creature \"Vraptize\" with \"there it lies—the Vraptize’s glare!\" and \"Its flumplish roar,\" showing direct confrontation. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action resolving tension: fourth stanza ends with \"*Slash!* cries the blade—and the beast fades away.\" Clear decisive action. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: fifth stanza says \"Homebound now, weighted with victory’s glow,\" and \"Thy cralls bear tales,\" showing return and celebration. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Counting distinct invented coinages (not canonical or standard English). Coinages identified: Kiridashi, scribish, whorlish, flaxen (borderline English but used fancifully), cralls, glimshrie, bromblen, Vraptize, sneembler, wump’ring, flumplish, cralls (repeat), foon. At least 8 distinct coined words: Kiridashi, scribish, whorlish, cralls, glimshrie, bromblen, Vraptize, sneembler, wump’ring, flumplish, foon.

So no (not every stanza has coinage).</C12_think>\n<C13_think>A non-canonical creature/entity named and central to action (not Jabberwock). \"Vraptize\" is the adversary creature central to the action. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia requires ≥2 bursts like \"snicker-snack\" or \"Pop!\". The poem has \"*Slash!*\" (somewhat onomatopoeic) but no other clear onomatopoeic bursts. Only one clear onomatopoeia. So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration or consonance in ≥2 stanzas: stanzas show \"scribish,\" \"scribes,\" \"swift-carved,\" \"sharp,\" \"shadow,\" \"sneembler,\" \"slash,\" \"sway,\" \"scribe,\" \"swift,\" \"swords,\" etc. Multiple alliterative sequences present in several stanzas. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order checked: starts with warning, then preparation, then encounter, decisive action, return/celebration, and ending ring echo. Order respected. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines from canonical poem. Phrases like \"Beware the...\" are used but not exact lines; \"snicker-snack\" or \"vorpal\" do not appear; this poem uses completely different invented words and no exact original lines. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexicon tokens: none of canonical words (brillig, slithy, toves, etc) appear except 'kiridashi' and 'foon' which are not canonical. So distinct canonical tokens ≤8, actually zero canonical tokens used. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Checking syllable tightness: Longer lines mostly 8–9 syllables; shorter lines 5–7 syllables aligned roughly with Jabberwocky's pattern. For example, stanzas with 8 or 9 syllables alternate with 5–7 syllables lines. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: multiple rhyme pairs (keen/gleam, deed/draw, line/sign, drift/gift, glare/quake, away/decay implied), no rhyme repeated >2 times except ring echo. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overused heavily; \"kiridashi\" appears ~3 times, \"foon\" twice, \"blade\" once, \"scribe\" several times but not >5 or 8%. No excessive repetition. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages stem from at least 5 distinct roots (kiridashi, glimshrie, bromblen, vraptize, sneembler, wump’ring, flumplish). No single suffix overload. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly about a creature/application similar to Jabberwocky, addressing a named foe (Kiridashi), in similar heroic structure. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext detectable: poem has implied motif about writing, scribes, and creative conflict (\"words are swords,\" \"lines we boldly hold\"), giving a coherent undertone beyond surface action. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.9166666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.9166666666666666, "criteria_yes": 22, "label": "high"}
