Coinages (*snortling, schlorp, mizzle*) vary in form and function, while alliteration (\"mirnsome gardens,\" \"damp-furred, left trails\") and onomatopoeia (*schlonk, pluffle*) heighten rhythm. The arc follows Carroll’s structure: warning → preparation → battle → return → reuse of \"drip\" in the final line to ring-close.", "info": {}}
