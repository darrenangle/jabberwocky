He shook his head, and smoothed his phrase” plus exultant lines earlier suggest return and celebratory mood.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Distinct invented coinages count ≥8: Coinages include Synthetikkaise, Wobble-Tone, Eurorack, Signal-Stand, Wire-Land, Cubicle-hood, Patch-splatter, Cwavelength, Synth-snarl, boojum (not canonical Carroll), chittered, whizzled, chuffed, snurled, chugged (some may be English but with playful usage); count easily ≥8 distinct invented or nonce words beyond standard English.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains ≥1 coinage: Early stanzas contain coinages repeatedly; later stanzas have several lines without clear coinages; some middle stanzas (like stanza 7 and 8) have no new coinage or no coinage at all—coinages not uniformly spread into every stanza.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named central to action (not ‘Jabberwock’): The Synthetikkaise is a named, distinct, central adversary; also \"Wobble-Tone\" and fanged Eurorack noted, but main foe is Synthetikkaise.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia ≥2 bursts: “whiffling” (Carroll canonical, used here), “bubbled like a noisy fluid!” (bubble is onomatopoeic imagery), plus “snicker-snack” is not used verbatim; \"chittered,\" \"whizzled,\" \"chuffed,\" \"snurled,\" \"chugged\" are sound-related verbs but less clearly onomatopoeic bursts. Overall onomatopoeic language present, but explicit bursts like \"Pop!\" or \"Snicker-snack!\" lacking. Only one good onomatopoeic burst \"whiffling,\" and \"bubbled\" is marginal. So borderline, unfortunately no full ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts of Carroll style.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas beyond incidental: Examples like “Signal-Stand,” “smoothed his phrase,” “patchbay quiet,” “modulated din,” “twist of jack” show some alliteration; also early stanza “snicker-snack” replaced with “voltage snaked,” “tangled clue,” “chittered fast” and “whizzled too,” “chuffed and snurled, he chugged anew” show clear consonance/alliteration. So yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc beats appear in canonical order: First admonition (\"Beware\"), then preparation (\"took his voltage,\" \"rested by Signal-Stand\"), encounter (\"came whiffling\"), decisive act (\"twist of jack…silence\"), return and celebration (\"he returned ... smoothed his phrase\"). Final stanza ring echo fits too. Arc order intact.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No exact canonical line matches: No line matches exactly the reference poem’s lines; wording and phrasing are original.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Distinct canonical tokens ≤8, favor new coinages: Uses a handful of canonical Carroll words (e.g., whiffling used once, burbled replaced by bubbled, snicker-snack replaced, maybe fewer canonical words); mostly new coinages dominate. Estimated canonical tokens count less than or equal to 8.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness in quatrains: syllable counts vary, some stanzas in 4 lines have lines with more than 9 syllables or fewer than 5; meter is looser than strict Jabberwocky (~8/6 pattern). Early stanzas partially approximate, but not all stanzas meet syllable tightness; less than 100% quatrains have correct line syllable lengths.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: end-rhyme (2,4) varies stanza to stanza with different rhymes; no exact end word reused more than twice except for ring echo; variety maintained across the poem.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: content words are fairly distributed, no overuse seen of a single content word beyond limits; no obvious overuse outside ring echo.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety with ≥4 distinct roots: Coinages come from distinct roots (Synthetikkaise, Wobble-Tone, Eurorack, Signal-Stand, Wire-Land, Cubicle-hood, Patch-splatter, Cwavelength, Synth-snarl, etc.); clearly ≥4 distinct roots; no single coined suffix dominates.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses the topic of a \"Synthetikkaise\" as an adversary in a similar fashion to Jabberwock, stays on this topic without deviation to other subjects.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Coherent implied subtext/motif present: underlying motif of man vs. synthetic beast, technology and sound battle, \"son\" and \"father\" framing, struggle and mastery of synthetic music or electronics; consistent undertone of mastering technology and noise control; yes, present.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.7916666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.7916666666666666, "criteria_yes": 19, "label": "medium"}

Roughly, line lengths do alternate in majority stanzas (e.g., stanza 1 lines 1&2 longer-shorter), about 5/8 stanzas meet this pattern; meets ≥60% threshold.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Review rhyme of lines (2,4). Most stanzas have some rhyme or slant rhyme in (2,4). For example stanza 1 “fill”/“will” rhyme, stanza 2 “line”/“shun” do not rhyme, stanza 3 “hand”/“band” rhyme, stanza 4 “dread”/“head” rhyme, stanza 5 “snicker-snack”/(6th line) “flew” no rhyme.

Clear ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition is present in stanza 2 with “Beware the Jitter-Jaws, my precious son!” and warnings about “wobbly bands” and “syncopation shun”.

Canonical arc order satisfied.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line verbatim matches canonical poem lines when normalized; “snicker-snack!” is same word but embedded in a different line, so no verbatim line duplication.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexicon tokens ≤8. The poem uses canonical tokens “snicker-snack”, “vorpal” is not present, “Jubjub” etc. not mentioned. Only “snicker-snack” from canonical list is used. So count is 1 < 8, so yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Check syllable counts: Longer lines ~8–9 syllables, shorter lines ~5–7. For example stanza 1 lines roughly scan to approx 9,6,9,7 - meets Jabberwocky’s ~8/6 pattern consistently across quatrains. All stanzas roughly follow this pattern.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes vary. For example, “fill/will”, “line/shun”, “hand/band”, “dread/head”, “snicker-snack/flew”, “son/son” (refrain repeated), “will” repeated twice in stanza 8 but only twice total. No word reused more than twice except for ring echo. Rhyme variety acceptable.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single word overused beyond threshold. Repetitions mostly structural or ring refrain (\"son\" is repeated thrice but within limits and limited content words strongly repeated). No overuse beyond ~8% content words.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show distinct roots: “flickersome”, “Chrono-Lissajous”, “flumphing”, “Jitter-Jaws”, “Dross-Wave”, “blither-wave”, “whisp’ring”, “probing-stick”, “jittering” spread across multiple roots and suffixes; no single suffix dominates >50%.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem clearly addresses a similar topic to Jabberwocky: a mythical creature encounter narrative with names close to invented monster and battle; topic adherence confirmed.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem’s waveform, sonic imagery, “zig-zag grid”, “phase spun” hints a subtext linked to oscillation, waves, time cycles—a deeper implied motif beyond surface narrative, coherent and detectable.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.9583333333333334, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.9583333333333334, "criteria_yes": 23, "label": "high"}

Total stanza count 8 is within 5-8. Good.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Checking rhythm: The poem mostly alternates longer and shorter lines per stanza (e.g., line 1 longer, line 2 shorter, line 3 longer, line 4 shorter). Content word count difference across lines in ≥5 stanzas likely meets threshold. Mostly yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme: Majority of stanzas have rhyme on lines 2 and 4 with near/consonant/slant rhyme (e.g., sheen/keen, grout/shout, jet/yet, snack/track). No AABB dominance; mostly ABAB or ABCB pattern. Meets criterion.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Final stanza repeats opening stanza almost verbatim but with slight differences (\"slabs\" instead of \"toves\", \"keen\" vs \"outgrabe\" etc.). It shares multiple repeated content words and is a clear refrain echoing the start. Yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present: The second stanza contains a warning \"Beware the Inlay-Maker, son!\" and cautions about jaws and hands, similar to canonical warning.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: The protagonist takes a \"sharpened stiletto\" and rests by \"lapis land\" standing in thought before the encounter. This counts as preparation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter/confrontation: The Inlay-Maker appears in stanza 4, described as coming \"clanking\" and \"chattered wildly\", a clear meeting with the adversary.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action present: The \"polished blade went snicker-snack\" through the foe, who was \"left dead\". This is a decisive slaying action resolving tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: The protagonist returns with the \"hue\" and is joyfully greeted, the celebratory tone present in stanza 7 with \"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\" and embracing arms.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Invented coinages: Count distinct invented words not canonical or standard English: slabs, marbled cabs, Inlay-Maker, Pietra Dura, dun, Ornitho-shout, ghivver, lapis land, clanking (common word), chattered (common word). About 6-7 strong coinages clearly invented or original compound nouns. Fewer than 8 distinct coinages likely. \"slabs\" and \"marbled cabs\" arguably coined compounds.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinages per stanza: Some stanzas lack a clear coinage, e.g. stanza 5 has \"ghivver\" possibly coined, stanza 7 mainly canonical exclamations, stanza 6 uses \"snicker-snack\" which is canonical lexical item, so not counted. Not every stanza has a clear coinage. Probably no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named: The \"Inlay-Maker\" is a named adversary, central to the poem's action, not canonical.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Snicker-snack present (canonical). Another onomatopoeic burst \"clanking\" and \"chattered\" might be borderline, but typically onomatopoeia means words like \"Pop!\", \"Hiss!\", or \"snicker-snack\". Only one strong onomatopoeia (\"snicker-snack\") clearly present. Not ≥2.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration and consonance: Some stanzas show consonance/alliteration, e.g. “slithy slabs,” “marbled cabs,” “polished blade” (less strong), \"clanking...chattered\". At least 2 stanzas show clear alliteration beyond incidental. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The poem follows canonical arc sequence: warning -> preparation -> encounter -> decisive action -> return and celebration in proper order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim lines: Multiple lines closely mirror canonical lines, especially first & last stanza with \"’Twas brillig, and the slithy...\" but canonical tokens replaced (slabs vs toves). However, line \"One, two! One, two! And through and through / The polished blade went snicker-snack!\" is a variant of the canonical \"One, two! One, two! And through and through / The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!\". Because \"One, two! One, two! And through and through\" is canonical exact, identical lines disqualify. Therefore no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens ≤8: The poem uses some canonical lexicon (brillig, slithy, borogoves, mome, snicker-snack, beamish, callooh!, callay!). Approximately 7-8 distinct canonical tokens, meets budget.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count: Lines roughly near Jabberwocky’s meter—long lines ~8-9 syllables, short lines ~5-7. This is met in majority of quatrains.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) line rhymes show some variety: sheen/keen, grout/shout, jet/yet, snack/track, and others. None reused >2 times excluding ring echo. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: Content words are varied, no single content word repeated excessively beyond threshold.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages stem from different roots: slabs, cabs, Inlay, Pietra, Dura, Ornitho, ghivver, lapis. More than 4 distinct roots, no single root >50% of coinages. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-type creature/adventure story with similar themes, adversary named and action matching the topic. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Implied undertone of craftsmanship and artistic battle (Pietra dura is stone inlay art), symbolic struggle. This consistent motif runs through the poem.

Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: Named adversary is \"grumbly\" describing a \"tumblin' coil\" but no non-canonical proper noun creature name given as a central character (it is an object - collet and a spring), no distinct named creature beyond generic descriptions; so no.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"clickety-clack,\" \"bickety-snap,\" \"whirred,\" \"whizz,\" \"clang\" present, more than two onomatopoeic bursts.

Approximates yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Since only 2 stanzas rhyme properly on (2,4), rhyme variety is low and also fewer rhymes overall; insufficient evidence of repeated rhyme words exceeding twice. Effectively no strong rhyme variety but also no repeated end word more than twice. Marginal no because rhyme presence itself is low.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is excessively repeated; no overuse detected.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages come from different roots (\"grumbly,\" \"bickety-snap,\" \"whizz,\" \"wobblin'\"), no dominant suffix or root >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem addresses the mechanics and battle with the \"collet\" and \"spring,\" akin to a mechanical challenge rather than the Jabberwock. Different from original mythical creature theme but still an encounter with a named antagonist. Depending on strictness of topic - if \"Jabberwocky\" style poem is expected to have such theme, this is a borderline substitution (mechanical part instead of creature). Since topic is not explicitly given here, but the poem theme resembles the original poem's structure and challenge theme, presumed yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond surface action (battle with mechanism), a subtext of struggle to restore balance and overcome chaos is implied consistently, suggesting a coherent undertone.

Early admonition clearly present.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation present: line \"He took his glimmick-sword in hand;\" and \"Long time the slithery foe he scanned.\" indicates preparation with armament and time taken.

Excluding canonical words, coinages ≥8: Stubble-Murk, Glooper-flock, glimmick-sword, chaffer, squelching (borderline normal English but unusual here), whizzing (standard English), thrumming (standard or poetic but not coinage), snicker-snoo (coinage), goo (common word, no), gyring (coinage), fleemish (coinage), jerk (common word, no), gleamish (coinage).

Many lines similar but wording changed enough; for example, lines like \"Beware the Stubble-Murk, my son!\" similar to original but not a verbatim line. The repeated last stanza is identical to the first stanza of this poem, which is original to this poem, not canonical. So no verbatim canonical lines. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens present/used: whiffling (Yes), snicker-snoo (altered from snicker-snack), jabbering (from Jabberwock?), \"O frabjous day! Callooh!

Most stanzas loosely stick to ~8 and ~6 syllable lines alternating, roughly matching Jabberwocky pattern. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes mostly with different rhyme endings like \"run\"/\"shun\", \"hand\"/\"land\", \"hood\"/\"brood\", \"through\"/\"goo\", \"son\"/\"gun\" repeated only twice. Max repeated rhyme ending no more than twice, exclusion of ring echo at end. Varied enough. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: content word repetition reasonable; no word overused excessively. For example \"Beware\" repeated twice but allowed, \"Stubble-Murk\" repeated several times but a proper noun allowed; no single content word >5 times or >8% of content words excess. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: many distinct coinages with varied roots: Stubble-Murk, Glooper-flock, glimmick, chaffer, squelching, whizzing, thrumming, snicker-snoo, gyring, fleemish, gleamish. More than 4 distinct roots and no suffix dominates >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-style monster narrative with a named adversary \"Stubble-Murk\" and a heroic quest matching the original poem's subject. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied layer: The poem has a clear undertone of caution, bravery, and heroic triumph.
