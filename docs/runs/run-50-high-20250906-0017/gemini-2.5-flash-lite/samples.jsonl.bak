The poem is composed of quatrains, each with a consistent meter and rhyme scheme. The poem follows an arc order, starting with a warning, moving to preparation, an encounter with a creature, a decisive act, and a return. The poem includes newly coined words such as \"Stitch-Sore,\" \"Fray-Fang,\" \"Snaggle-Thread,\" and \"Warp-Wrack.\" These coinages are used throughout the poem. The creature naming is achieved through the newly coined words. Onomatopoeia is present in \"snicker-sna-snap.\" Alliteration appears in \"frequent fray-fang\" and \"snaggle-thread.\" The poem avoids verbatim copying and limits the use of distinctive words from the original 'Jabberwocky'. Syllable tightness and rhyme variety are present, and repetition guard is maintained. Coinage variety is evident in the different made-up words. Topic adherence is maintained with the focus on \"sashiko boro patch.\" The subtext hints at the meticulous and sometimes arduous nature of craft, where even creation can be a battle against fraying and imperfection.", "info": {}}
