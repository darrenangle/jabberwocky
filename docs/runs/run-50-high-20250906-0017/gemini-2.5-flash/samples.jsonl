No strong AABB dominance. >60% met.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: final stanza echoes opening with multiple repeated content words/phrases (\"’Twas Bleakbloom\", \"did gyre and gimble in the wabe\", \"All crimmle\", \"Gloom-Bird did chirfle grave\") - definitely yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition early: Present in second stanza with “Beware the Gloom-Bird, son!” and further warning lines.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: Protagonist takes \"Glinter-blade in hand\", \"Long time foe sought\", \"Rested ... and stood a-pondering\" - clear preparation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: Yes; stanza with \"And, as in blebbish thought he stood\", \"The Gloom-Bird came\" describes clear meeting.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive act: Yes; \"One, two! One, two!\" stanza with \"Glinter-blade went snicker-snack!\" and \"It left it dead\".</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Yes; stanza praising the slain creature, with \"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\" and \"he chortled in his utter joy\".</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Invented word coinages distinct ≥8? Coinages include: Bleakbloom, frothly, crimmle, Gloom-Bird, chirfle, Glinter-blade, Grimsome, Eldritch, blebbish - about 9 distinct coinages, excluding standard or canonical (gyre, gimble, wabe, whiffling, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish). So yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza contains at least 1 coinage: Yes — \"Bleakbloom\", \"frothly snow\", \"crimmle\", \"Gloom-Bird\", \"Glinter-blade\", \"Grimsome\", \"Eldritch\", \"blebbish\", \"chirfle\" spread across stanzas.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: Non-canonical creature named and central—\"Gloom-Bird\" repeated and is adversary; not canonical Jabberwock.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: At least 2 onomatopoeic bursts—\"snicker-snack!\" used as in original; also \"chirfle\" could be onomatopoeic, plus \"burbled\". Taking canonical onomatopoeia \"snicker-snack\" and \"burbled\" is from canonical but allowed; \"chirfle\" arguably onomatopoeic. Minimum 2 onomatopoeias present; \"snicker-snack!\" and \"chirfle\".</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas: Examples: \"Gloom-Bird did chirfle grave\", \"Glinter-blade\", \"Long time the Grimsome foe he sought\", \"stood a-pondering\" show some alliteration and consonance beyond incidental. At least two stanzas clearly apply.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration in proper order: Present as per stanza sequence; follows canonical arc precisely.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines from canonical poem: Some lines are very similar or close, e.g. \"’Twas ... and the ... toves / Did gyre and gimble in the wabe\" replicated with small changes. But lines like \"The Gloom-Bird did chirfle grave\" differ fully. Key is if any line identical exactly to canonical poem after normalizing whitespace and punctuation. \"Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:\" repeated multiple times verbatim, which is canonical phrase. This is verbatim canonical line included exactly twice: second line of first and last stanza. So no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Number of distinct canonical tokens ≤8, favoring new coinages. Uses canonical tokens: gyre, gimble, wabe, mome, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish (8 distinct). No extra canonical tokens. Meets budget.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines about 8–9 syllables, shorter 5–7 per stanza. Lines like “’Twas Bleakbloom, and the frothly snow” (~8), “Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:” (~6), similar to original. Pattern maintained across most stanzas. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: End rhymes (2,4) vary between stanzas: wabe/grave; chill/thrill; hand/strand; ice/nice; snicker-snack/back; boy/joy; wabe/grave repeated in ring. No rhyme word reused >2 times outside ring. Under 3 repeats total. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word grossly overused: \"Gloom-Bird\" repeated multiple times but less than 5 times total, overall vocabulary balanced. No excessive repetition.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages have multiple roots (Bleakbloom, frothly, crimmle, chirfle, Glinter, Grimsome, Eldritch, blebbish, Gloom-Bird) with suffixes and roots varied; no >50% from single root/suffix. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Clearly addresses a Lewis Carroll style coinage creature poem about a Gloom-Bird, with a familiar arc and terms. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Implied layer of a dark, chilling, ominous atmosphere (“Gloom of Bleakbloom”, “teeth of ice”) beyond action; apprehension and triumph; consistent motif.

Overall generally fits the syllable pattern well enough in every stanza; no clear violations.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The rhyme pairs on lines 2 and 4 differ stanza to stanza; no single rhyme word repeated more than twice as end rhyme (excluding ring echo). Rhymes appear varied.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overused.

In this poem, many stanzas show alternation between a roughly 8–9 syllable line and a shorter ~5-7 syllable line in alternating lines (e.g., stanza 2: \"He took his Banneton in hand\" (7 sylls) / \"Long time the yeasty foe he sought—\"(8 sylls)). However, some alternations are closer. At least 5 of 7 stanzas show this pattern clearly, which is over 60%, so criterion met.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme: Stanzas generally rhyme lines 2 and 4; e.g., stanza 1 \"snags\" / \"shags\", stanza 2 \"sought\" / \"thought\", stanza 3 \"flame\" / \"came\", stanza 4 \"snicker-snack\" / \"due\" (no rhyme here - “snicker-snack” and “due” do not rhyme), stanza 5 \"Autolyse\" / \"boy\" (no rhyme), stanza 6 “rise” / “snags” (first and last stanza are the same stanza; need to count individual stanzas). This indicates in one or two stanzas (e.g., stanza 4 and 5) rhyme of 2 and 4 lines is not present or weak. So about 5 of 7 stanzas have rhyme (2,4). This is close to but does not hit the 60% cutoff cleanly because stanza 4/5 fail. Thus borderline, answer no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring Composition: The final stanza repeats (or echoes) the opening stanza with several repeated content words: “Beware the Autolyse, my son!” repeated exactly both places, also references to “Sour-dough” and “shags” at the end. The final stanza is a 4-line stanza (though structure is slightly different in order). At least 2 repeated key content words/phrases are present between first and last stanza. So yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition: The second line of the poem and the last stanza clearly say \"Beware\", as in “Beware the Autolyse, my son!”, typical admonition style as in Jabberwocky. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation or armament: The poem includes \"He took his Banneton in hand; Long time the yeasty foe he sought— Then rested he by Flour-Bin grand, And stood awhile in thought.\" This matches the preparation stage before confrontation. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: The stanza \"And, as in whiffled thought he stood, The Autolyse, with eyes of flame, Came whiffling through the wild wood, And burbled as it came!\" clearly describes meeting the adversary. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: \"One, two! One, two! And through and through The Banneton went snicker-snack! He left it dead, and with its due He went galumphing back.\" The decisive slaying action is here, resolving tension.

He chortled in his joy.” Celebratory return present. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: New invented words not canonical: Autolyse, Banneton, Levain-woeful, Sour-dough shags, whiffled, wild wood (wild is normal), due (normal), gluten snags, flour-bin grand. Among these, \"Autolyse,\" \"Banneton,\" \"Levain-woeful,\" \"shags,\" \"whiffled,\" “gluten-snags” count as coinages or nonce words. Counting distinct coined words: Autolyse, Banneton, Levain-woeful, whiffled, shags, gluten-snags. Possibly fewer than 8 distinct coinages; borderline but likely no because only around 6 clear invented or strongly nonce coinages. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza coinage presence: Some stanzas have clear coinages like “Levain-woeful” (first), “Banneton” (second), “whiffled” (third), “Autolyse” (third and repeated), “gluten snags” (last), “Sour-dough, and its shags” (last). However, the poem’s fourth stanza is mainly “whiffling,” “burbled,” which are canonical. The fifth stanza uses “Banneton” again, sixth stanza mainly canonical words and “beamish\". Last stanza some canonical words with repeated “Beware”. Almost all stanzas but possibly the sixth stanza coinage unclear beyond canonical words. Therefore, not all stanzas have coinage. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: The creature is \"Autolyse,\" which is a baking term adopted as the adversary; it is named and central to action and confrontation. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts: “snicker-snack!” is present, “burbled” is used (canonical), no other clear onomatopoeic bursts like \"Pop!\", \"Hiss!\", \"Snicker-snack\". \"whiffling\" likely considered as in canonical poem. No second distinct onomatopoeic burst clearly present. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in at least 2 stanzas: Examples include “Banneton in hand” and “Long time the yeasty foe he sought”, but these are mild. The first stanza has “Levain-woeful”, “Sour-dough shags” (soft consonance “s”). Limited and borderline. No clear strong alliteration beyond incidental. No.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The poem clearly shows canonical arc order: warning (stanza 1), preparation (2), encounter (3), decisive action (4), return/celebration (5), then ring (final stanza). Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: “He left it dead, and with its head / He went galumphing back.” is verbatim from Jabberwocky. Also, “One, two! One, two! And through and through / The Banneton went snicker-snack!” is a close copy but with “Banneton” substituted. The identical line “He left it dead, and with its head / He went galumphing back.” is present exactly. So failed verbatim line match. No.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical word budget ≤8: Uses “whiffling”, “burbled”, “beamish”, “galumphing”, “snicker-snack”, “frabjous day”, “Callooh! Callay!”, “chortled”, “wise”, “stood”, “came”. About 9+ canonical or close lexis, some repeated. Slightly exceeds 8 distinct canonical tokens due to many repeated or slight variants. No.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines roughly 8-9 syllables, shorter lines 5-7 syllables in ≥all stanzas. Mostly lines are close to 7-9 syllables for long lines and 5-7 for short lines. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme varies across stanzas \"snags/shags\" (stanza 1), \"sought/thought\" (2), \"flame/came\" (3), \"snicker-snack/due\" (4 - no rhyme), \"Autolyse/boy\" (5 - no rhyme), “rise/snags”(7 stanza). Some rhyme repeats (“snags/shags” twice) and some stanzas no rhyme. So rhyme variety is limited, failing variety criterion. No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word overused beyond 5 times or 8%; “Autolyse” appears 4 times, “Beware” 3–4 times but all acceptable moderate repetition. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages have 3 or 4 distinct roots (“Autolyse”, “Banneton”, “Levain-woeful”, “whiffled”, “shags/gluten-snags” suffixes). Coined suffix repetition is moderate. Borderline but likely no due to fewer than 4 distinct roots or high suffix repetition. No.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses the “Autolyse” as named adversary, a baking-themed parody, consistent with original topic style. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is a metaphor or undertone about baking (“Autolyse”, “Banneton”, “Levain”, “Sourdough”).

Need to check stanza structure: by line breaks, the poem has 6 stanzas each with either 2 or 4 lines? Actually, line grouping is:  \n1) 2 lines (admonition)  \n2) 2 lines (preparation)  \n3) 2 lines (encounter)  \n4) 2 lines? (climax)  \n5) 2 lines (celebration)  \n6) 2 lines (epilogue/repeat)  \nEach stanza has only 2 lines, not 4 lines; also total stanza count 6 (within 5-8), but quatrain shape fails. Therefore, no quatrains present and C2 is no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Without quatrains (4 lines), cannot evaluate alternating long/short line meter reliably. Also line length alternation unlikely to meet 60% required. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>No quatrains, so rhyme scheme analysis for line 2 and 4 per stanza does not apply. Rhyme appears irregular and scattered. Thus, no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza partly repeats warning terms; includes phrase \"Beware the Quilliwog\" matching opening admonition and repeats some creature names (\"Scrall\" and \"Grallix-drog\"). Contains ≥2 repeated content words/phrases from opening stanza. Ring composition criterion likely satisfied.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>First stanza starts with \"Beware, my son, the Quilliwog!\" which is a clear admonition.

Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Fourth stanza shows the encounter: \"Quilliwog, with eyes aflame, / Came whiffling through ... and burbled\". Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Fifth stanza describes decisive action: striking \"One, two! One, two! And through and through / the styl-blade went\" and \"He left it dead\". Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Fifth stanza includes celebration: \"he penned his triumph, heaven-sent.\" Sixth stanza also has celebratory elements: \"O frabjous day! Callooh!

At least 8 distinct invented coinages easily. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinages appear in every stanza: 1st stanza (Quilliwog, Scrall, Grallix-drog, Nib-Tine), 2nd (styl-blade, Micro-Mesh, Pensil-strand), 3rd (whiffled), 4th (Quilliwog, inky wood, burbled), 5th (styl-blade, gidd-gallop), 6th (Nib-Tine, Micro-Mesh, Quilliwog, Scrall, Grallix-drog).

Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creatures/entities besides canonical Jabberwock: main foe is \"Quilliwog\" (not \"Jabberwock\"), with others \"Scrall\", \"Grallix-drog\", \"Nib-Tine\", \"Micro-Mesh\" which appear as adversaries or obstacles. Quilliwog is central. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts: \"whiffling\" and \"burbled\" are canonical onomatopoeic words. Also \"gidd-gallop\" suggests onomatopoeic sound.

Sixth stanza more like postscript/repeat.  \nArc beats largely in canonical order. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Check for verbatim lines from original Jabberwocky: none of the lines exactly matches original lines from reference poem. Some phrases like \"One, two! One, two!

Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Jabberwocky uses ballad meter with approx 8-9 syllables in long lines and 5-7 in short lines alternating per stanza of 4 lines. Here no quatrains; lines often longer or shorter unevenly; line lengths are variable without strict adherence to ballad meter syllable tightness. Criterion fails.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety across stanza 2 and 4 lines does not apply; rhyme scheme sparse and limited to couplets or none; no repeated rhyme endings >2 times observed but insufficient rhyme scheme to assess variety. Borderline but effectively no enough rhyming variety as no proper rhyme scheme established. No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word overused beyond reasonable limits. Words like \"Quilliwog\", \"Beware\" appear multiple times but not >5 times or >8% given short poem length. No obvious overuse.

No single suffix dominates coinages. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem clearly addresses the topic: a Jabberwocky-style narrative naming a non-canonical creature \"Quilliwog\" and related creatures; no topic substitution. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Coherent undertone/subtext: focus on caution, preparation, confrontation, triumph, and possible theme of passage to maturity or confrontation of fear, similar to Jabberwocky. The poem implies this subtext through admonition, challenge, and celebration.

Yes.</C5_think> \n<C6_think>Early admonition present: \"“Beware the Snibblewock, my son! ...\" is a clear warning to protagonist.

Callay!\", \"He chortled in his joy.\" Yes.</C10_think> \n<C11_think>Count distinct coinages (excluding canonical Carroll words): frabbish, snibblewocks, kiridashi, whiffing, scribal (arguably standard English but unusual as a coinage here), possibly none others; less than 8 distinct coinages—no.</C11_think> \n<C12_think>Coinages present in multiple stanzas but not every stanza (some mostly canonical or standard English); not all stanzas have coinages; no.</C12_think> \n<C13_think>Named non-canonical creature: yes, the \"Snibblewock\" is central and distinct from canonical Jabberwock. Yes.</C13_think> \n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: contains \"snicker-snack\" (canonical), but no ≥2 distinct onomatopoeic bursts visible (like pop, hiss, etc.); one only; no.</C14_think> \n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance notable? \"keen and bright\", \"stood a while in thought\", \"whiffing through the tulgey wood\", \"many days he sought\"; a couple stanzas show some notable alliteration/consonance beyond incidental but fewer than 2 stanzas clearly; borderline but leaning no.</C15_think> \n<C16_think>Arc order seen: warning/admonition → preparation → encounter → decisive action → return/celebration; roughly canonical order maintained; yes.</C16_think> \n<C17_think>Contains verbatim lines from canonical poem exactly (e.g., “All mimsy were the borogoves,” “And the mome raths outgrabe.”, “He left it dead,” and multiple others); no.</C17_think> \n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used: mimsy, borogoves, mome, raths, outgrabe, Jubjub, Bandersnatch, vorpal, manxome, Tumtum, uffish, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish, chortled, frabjous, Callooh! Callay! — many canonical tokens (>>8); no.</C18_think> \n<C19_think>Syllable counts in longer and shorter lines are inconsistent due to stanza structure, some very long or run-on lines; not consistently 8–9 and 5–7 syllables per line; no.</C19_think> \n<C20_think>Rhyme words repeated multiple times (\"wabe\"/\"outgrabe\", \"catch\"/\"Bandsersnatch\", \"thought\"/\"caught\" (?)…); rhyme variety limited, with some end words repeated more than twice; no.</C20_think> \n<C21_think>Content word repetition outside ring echo includes repeated canonical words as \"mimsy\", \"borogoves\", \"mome\", \"raths\", but no single content word overused excessively; borderline yes but safe answer yes.</C21_think> \n<C22_think>Coinage variety low: only a few coined roots; no single suffix dominates but overall coinages <8 so fails for variety; no.</C22_think> \n<C23_think>Clear topic (Jabberwocky style poem about a creature named Snibblewock) maintained without deviation; yes.</C23_think> \n<C24_think>Subtext coherent: warning, courage/preparation, battle, triumph motif apparent; classical undercurrent to the quest; yes.</C24_think> \n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.5, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 0.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 0.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 0.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 1.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.5, "criteria_yes": 12, "label": "low"}
