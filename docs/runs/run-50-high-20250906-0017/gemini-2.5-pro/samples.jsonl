More than 8 distinct invented coinages are present (flemper, slorpy, grickle, constructs, ink-raths, Gnarlnib, flink-flame, glogging, chann-gland, glumpish, skritching, Fount-wood, burbulating, hurreed). Definitely yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage: e.g. stanza 1 (flemper, slorpy, ducts, grickle...), stanza 2 (Gnarlnib, glumps, scrimps, viscid), stanza 3 (flink-flame, glogging, chann-gland, glumpish), stanza 4 (glumpish, Gnarlnib, skritching, Fount-wood, burbulating, grot), stanza 5 (flink-flame, lick, glogging, grickling), stanza 6 (beamish, hurroo, hurreed), stanza 7 (flemper, slorpy, ducts, grickle), stanza 8 (mimsy (canonical), constructs, ink-raths, clump).

So yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines exactly verbatim from canonical poem; some phrases echo canon but no exact line matches on normalizing punctuation or spacing. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens appear e.g. \"mimsy\", \"beamish\" only twice; total ≤8 distinct canonical tokens, mostly new coinages. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts roughly fit Jabberwocky pattern: longer lines approx 8-9 syllables, shorter lines 5-7 syllables in quatrains. Checked stanza 1 and 3 as samples: stanza 1 lines approximate 8,5,7,6 syllables; stanza 3 lines about 9,7,8,6. So yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Slant rhymes on (2,4) lines varied across stanzas; no end word reused more than twice except in ring echo stanza which is allowed. So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word excessively repeated; \"Gnarlnib\" appears a few times but below threshold; content words well varied. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show multiple distinct roots; suffixes vary; no dominant suffix >50% usage. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-style encounter with the Gnarlnib; stays on theme, no subject substitution.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext coherent as an allegory of a perilous foe overcome; a cautionary hero’s quest motif is clear beyond surface action.

Canonical lexicon from Jabberwock: brillig, slithy, toves, gyre, gimble, wabe, mimsy, borogoves, mome, raths, outgrabe, Jubjub, Bandersnatch, vorpal, manxome, Tumtum, uffish, whiffling, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish.  \n- From these, none used except \"Beware\" which is normal English, not a coinage.  \n- The poem uses no canonical invented words. So canonical tokens = 0. Definitely <=8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness:  \n- Checking longer lines (mostly line 1 and 3) have ~8-9 syllables, shorter lines (2 and 4) ~5-7.  \n- Stanza 1 line 1: ’Twas drop-lic, and the grum-bling clouds (8 syll)  \n- line2: Did chyme and clat-tle in the grey; (7 syll)  \n- line3: All shiv-ver-ing were the wind-ly shrouds, (8 syll)  \n- line4: And the mists came fum-ing all the day.

Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overused.

Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety root-wise:  \nExamples: droplic, chyme, clattle, shivvering, pillomuff, piskitter-wild, roracket, gummished, tintangled, triumphish, Trankwillow. Clearly multiple distinct roots; no suffix dominates >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>The poem addresses \"Pluvial Plunk,\" clearly a beast or creature related to rain and storm, matching the Jabberwocky style topic of a monster confrontation. Adheres to topic: yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext beyond surface: The poem evokes themes of confronting fears (rainstorm), preparation and courage, and eventual calm or peace (\"peaceful boy,\" \"silent day\"). This gives a coherent undertone of overcoming adversity or inner peace.
