'Bell's' is English, 'deep', 'hum' English. \"Tolltome\" and \"Humgrumble\" clearly coinages. Clangous is a new invented adjective. Only about 3-4 distinct coined words. Not ≥8. -> no</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Does each stanza contain ≥1 coinage: first stanza has Orinbell, Humgrumble. Second stanza has Tolltome. Third stanza uses uffish (canonical). Fourth stanza: Orinbell (named creature). Fifth stanza: Tolltome. Sixth stanza: Orinbell, beamish (canonical). Seventh stanza: clangous. Eighth stanza repeats English phrase. So 7/8 stanzas contain at least 1 coinage (either canonical or new). However, criterion requires coinages excluding canonical? No, it says including canonical. So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named non-canonical creature/entity: Orinbell named central to action, distinct from Jabberwock. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Are there ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts? \"snicker-snack!\" is present. No other obvious onomatopoeia like \"Pop!\" or \"Hiss!\". \"Tolltome went snicker-snack!\" only one onomatopoeic burst clearly. \"bells that toll, claws that chime\" are auditory words but not bursts or interjections. So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas: \"Bell's deep hum\", \"Tolltome took\", \"manxome foe\" (canonical), \"tumtum tree\", \"came whiffling\", several within-line repeated consonants, true alliteration limited but present in at least 2 stanzas -> yes</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza 1), preparation (2), encounter(3-4), decisive action (5), return/celebration (6-7), ring (8) - arc follows canonical order cleanly -> yes</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines from canonical poem: Compare lines carefully. Multiple lines are direct carryover with substitution: \"And, as in uffish thought he stood,\" is from canonical. \"He took his...in hand; Long time the manxome foe he sought— So rested he by the Tumtum tree And stood awhile in thought.\" are verbatim except weapon and foe renamed. These lines are exact (except weapon and foe word substitutions). Per instructions, line matching canonical line verbatim means \"no\". So some lines are verbatim except one word changed, which counts as modified, allowed? The line must exactly match to fail. Check exact line \"Long time the manxome foe he sought—\" matches canonical line exactly even though foe is generic foe vs Jabberwock in original (the canonical line is \"Long time the manxome foe he sought—\" which is present verbatim. So presence of exact canonical line means fail this criterion. So no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used ≤8, favoring new coinages. Canonical tokens used are manxome, uffish, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, beamish, galumphing, frumious. Count 8 canonical tokens present. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines ~8–9 syllables and shorter lines ~5–7 in every quatrain stanza. Check first stanza lines: \"Beware the Bell's deep hum, my son!\" (7 syll), \"The jaws that toll, the claws that chime!\" (8 syll), etc. Met in ~60% stanzas. So yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes varied without reuse >2 except ring echo. Rhymes like \"son\"/\"shun\", \"thought\"/\"thought\" repeated, \"flame\"/\"came\", \"snicker-snack\"/\"back\", \"Orinbell\"/\"Callay\" (weak), \"shade\"/\"fade\". Some rhymes repeated but no rhyme word reused >2 times excluding ring echo. So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word overused >5 times or >8%. Common words are 'Bell', 'Orinbell' repeated but it's a proper noun central to topic, allowed. No overused generic content word visible. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages present include Orinbell, Tolltome, Humgrumble, clangous (multiple roots), so ≥4 distinct roots? Actually only 4 distinct coined roots total (Orinbell, Tolltome, Humgrumble, clangous) with some suffix variation but 4 root coinages total is borderline acceptable - required ≥4 distinct roots. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem is about \"The Orinbell Hum\" which is close to Jabberwocky theme, consistent naming and story, matches topic rather than substituting different subject. So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond surface, there is an undertone of caution/heroism and father-son relationship, reflected in repeated admonition and journey motif.

Many are canonical, others clearly invented. Counting those definitely invented (not canonical nor common English): plishy, slumbrous, sprogs, drip and drabble are near English but \"drabble\" may be borderline; \"wimbly\", \"wattle-frogs\", \"tin-torrent\", \"Tintinnabu\", \"Plum-bird\", \"Slabble-snatch\", \"Vorpal-pot\", \"Tum-tum\" is variant of Tumtum but hyphenated; \"Slabble-snatch\" is new.

E.g., first stanza differs from \"'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\" enough to avoid exact match. Some lines like \"One, two! One, two! And through and through\" are canonical repeated phrases—but comparison with canonical lines shows exact canonical lines of \"One, two! One, two! And through and through\" is in the original. Since this exact line is verbatim in stanza 5, this violates no exact match. Therefore no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used: \"manxome\", \"Tum-tum\" (variant of Tumtum), \"tulgey\", \"whiffling\", \"burbled\", \"snicker-snack\", \"galumphing\", \"beamish\", \"frumious\" (new coinage but canonical-like). The canonical tokens used are within 8 distinct tokens (manxome, Tumtum, tulgey, whiffling, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish). \"frumious\" is a known canonical adjective not in original poem but from Carroll's lexicon, allowing some leeway. Count ≤8 canonical tokens, yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines around 8–9 syllables, shorter lines about 5–7 syllables mostly met. Example stanza 1 lines syllable counts roughly: line1=6, line2=7, line3=6, line4=6 slightly short but consistent. Some stanzas slightly short but generally adhere to Jabberwocky pattern; borderline but good.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme words like \"catch/snatch\", \"deep/steep\", \"flame/came\", \"snicker-snack/back\", \"boy/joy\", \"frumious Slabble-snatch\" rhymes repeated but not overused; no word reused more than twice excluding ring. So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overused excessively; content words vary; repeated \"Tintinnabu\" 4 times is acceptable as creature name; no overuse beyond 8% or 5 times of general content words.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages stem from multiple roots: \"plish\", \"slumbrous\", \"sprog\", \"drip\", \"wimbly\", \"wattle-frog\", \"tin-torrent\", \"Tintinnabu\", \"Plum-bird\", \"Slabble\", \"Vorpal-pot\". More than 4 distinct roots with no suffix dominating >50%. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses the same topic as Jabberwocky—a fantasy battle poem with a strange creature \"Tintinnabu\" instead of Jabberwock, with similar events and motif. So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem retains a motif of father’s advice, bravery, battle, triumph, and homecoming—implied coming-of-age or rite of passage layer consistent with original subtext.

Total stanzas = 7, but not all are quatrains; fifth stanza has 6 lines and sixth stanza only 3 lines. Hence, fails uniform quatrain requirement.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter: In canonical Jabberwocky, lines alternate between longer (8-9 syll.) and shorter (5-7 syll.). Checking each stanza for ≥2 content-word difference and alternating line lengths: First stanza mostly balanced; second stanza likely a similar alternation; third stanza similar; fourth stanza similar; fifth stanza has extra lines which disrupt pattern; sixth stanza short; seventh stanza shorter. Counting stanzas with clear longer/shorter alternate lines: about 4/7 meet pattern, less than 60%.

So roughly 3 stanzas clearly rhyme in 2 and 4 lines, out of 7 - less than 60%. Also, AABB dominance is avoided. But threshold not met.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: final stanza echoes opening stanza with identical line \"'Twas brillig, and the slithy dodols Did gyre and gimble in the chrome;\" Similar to the canonical ring, but uses \"dodols\" and \"chrome\" rather than original words, and repeats content words \"brillig\", \"gyre\", \"gimble\", mimsy, mome, raths, outgrabe; at least 3 repeated content words from the opening stanza. So yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Admonition or warning early: The first stanza starts with \"Beware the Flashgob, Son, that snaps! Beware the Shadesnarl...\" clearly an admonition to the protagonist. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation or armament before encounter: \"He took his Grade-Switch, swift and keen: Long time the f-stop zone he sought; Then rested by the Tint-tank green, And stood awhile in thought.\" He prepares by taking a tool (grade-switch), looks for the f-stop zone (planning), and rests. Clear preparation and armament present. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: \"And as in uffish thought he stood, The Flashgob, with eyes of flame, Came whiffling through the cellulose wood, And burbled as it came!\" The adversary Flashgob appears and confronts protagonist. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive act resolving tension: \"Snap, flash! It gobbled silver gleam, The paper hissed with potent burn! One, two! One, two! And through and through The Grade-Switch went snicker-snack! He snatched it, snipped it, made it clean, And with a deft turn, did adjourn.\" A decisive cutting/slaying action with the Grade-Switch ending the confrontation. Clear decisive action. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return or celebration: Last stanza (before ring echo) is: \"\\\"And hast thou slain the Flashgob? Come! Burn-bright joy! O beam-shot day!\\\" He chortled in his glee-some home.\" There is a return and exultant celebration. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: Words invented or uncommon like Flashgob, Shadesnarl, Tweakspin, Grade-Switch, f-stop zone, Tint-tank, cellulose wood, glee-some, dodols, borogroves. Counting: Flashgob, Shadesnarl, Tweakspin, Grade-Switch, f-stop, Tint-tank, cellulose, glee-some, dodols, borogroves - ≥8 distinct new coinages or neologisms not canonical or standard English. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza has at least one coinage: 1st stanza: Flashgob, Shadesnarl, Tweakspin; 2nd stanza: Grade-Switch, f-stop, Tint-tank; 3rd stanza: uffish, Flashgob, cellulose; 4th stanza: no obvious coinage, but \"Snap\" and \"flash\" are English words, \"gobbled\" is English; 5th stanza: Grade-Switch repeated, \"snicker-snack\" canonical; \"deft turn\" no coinage—this stanza mostly standard words except Grade-Switch; 6th stanza: no distinct coinage - beam-shot is hyphenated, possibly neo, \"glee-some\" is coinage; 7th stanza has dodols and borogroves (coinages). So all stanzas except possibly the 4th and 6th contain coinages. Counting 5 or more out of 7 stanzas have coinages, which is less than 7/7 required for \"each stanza\" condition. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>A non-canonical creature named and central (not Jabberwock): The \"Flashgob\" is named and is central to the conflict. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"Snap, flash!\" in line five; \"snicker-snack!\" pencil-sharp as canonical; \"burbled\" from canonical lexicon; \"hissed\" is onomatopoeic; \"gobbled\" may be borderline. At least two onomatopoeic bursts present: \"Snap, flash!\" and \"snicker-snack!\". Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats: \"Flashgob, Son, that snaps! Beware the Shadesnarl, stark and thin!\" has s- alliteration; \"snatched it, snipped it, made it clean,\" has repeated s- sounds. At least 2 stanzas have clear alliteration/consonance. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning in stanza 1. Preparation in stanza 2. Encounter in stanza 3. Decisive act in stanza 5. Return/celebration in stanza 6. Ring echo in stanza 7. The arc beats are in canonical order. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines matching canonical poem exactly: Some lines are very close, for example the final stanza's last four lines are very close to the original's ring stanza. But they differ: \"’Twas brillig, and the slithy dodols Did gyre and gimble in the chrome;\" changes \"toves\" to \"dodols\" and \"wabe\" to \"chrome\", so no exact matches. No direct verbatim lines appear. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens count: \"’Twas brillig\", \"and\", \"the\", \"did\", \"gyre\", \"and\", \"mimsy\", \"were\",\"borogroves\",\"and\",\"mome\",\"raths\",\"outgrabe\" - The poem uses \"brillig\", \"mimsy\", \"borogroves\", \"mome\", \"raths\", \"outgrabe\" from canonical set, plus \"uffish\", \"whiffling\", \"burbled\", \"snicker-snack\", \"beamish\" all from canonical lexicon. Total distinct canonical tokens ≤8? The model uses canonical words: \"brillig\", \"mimsy\", \"borogroves\", \"mome\", \"raths\", \"outgrabe\", \"uffish\", \"whiffling\", \"burbled\", \"snicker-snack\", \"beamish\" which is more than 8 distinct canonical tokens (about 11). No.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Jabberwocky uses ~8-9 syllables in longer lines and ~5-7 in shorter lines in quatrains. Quatrains mostly conform, but fifth stanza with 6 lines and sixth with 3 lines break this. Overall syllable pattern inconsistently fits across all quatrains. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The 2,4 lines rhymes spread is mixed. Rhyme words \"keen\"/\"green\", \"flame\"/\"came\" repeated. Some end words reused >2 times (e.g., repeated “come” \"home\" in last stanzas). Variety is moderate but not very strong. Borderline but probably no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word overused to an extreme level. \"the\" and common content words repeated normally. No overuse detected. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages include Flashgob, Shadesnarl, Tweakspin, Grade-Switch, f-stop, Tint-tank, cellulose, glee-some, dodols, borogroves - roots seem quite varied with no single suffix dominating (>50%). Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem addresses a conflict involving a fantastical creature and a heroic figure, matching the theme of Jabberwocky (a creature hunt/slaying). The topic of imaginary creature and adventurous encounter is clearly sustained. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond the surface, there is a motif of photography/imaging (Grade-Switch, f-stop zone, Tint-tank, cellulose wood), suggesting an extended metaphor about creation or exposure with confrontation as creative struggle. This coherent undertone is perceptible. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.7083333333333334, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.7083333333333334, "criteria_yes": 17, "label": "medium"}
