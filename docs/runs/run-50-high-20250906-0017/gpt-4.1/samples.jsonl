Yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: final stanza echoes opening stanza with repeated content words (\"Ebonfeed\", \"fretter-fast\", \"heat-set\", \"friend\", phrases like \"Though heat-set, hissed, and fretter-fast!\"). Clear echo with ≥2 content words repeated.

Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: Stanza 5 describes decisive action (\"One, two! One, two!... The beast in stanch / Lay leached of biting hue.\"), indicating defeat. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: The final stanza shows return & reassurance without explicit celebration, but includes calming lines (\"Fret not the Ebonfeed...\"), less jubilant than original poem.

Only canonical words used are \"Beware\" (common), \"One, two! One, two!\" (common phrase but not a canonical lexical token), \"and\", \"the\". The poem avoids canonical coinages like \"slithy,\" \"toves,\" \"borogoves,\" etc. So canonical lexical budget is low ≤8.

Five stanzas with 2,4 rhyme evident. No AABB dominance since mostly ABAB. Rhyme meets threshold.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>No clear ring composition. The last stanza references the Brayerwock and its \"sprockle trail,\" but the first stanza mentions \"sprockle trail\" too; however, exact repeated phrases are only one or two partial overlaps. The last stanza's last line \"Its sprockle trail’s relayed\" echoes the first stanza's \"It leaves a sprockle trail\" in concept and a content phrase, so this counts as a minimal ring echo with ≥2 repeated content words (\"Brayerwock\" and \"sprockle trail\").</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition: the first stanza says \"Beware the inky Brayerwock,\" which is a direct warning line early in poem. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: second stanza includes \"prepare your squidge-defending hand,\" indicating preparation before encounter. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: Third stanza shows meeting \"And lo! The Brayerwock comes near— / With krindle-swish and slappertap!\" Clear encounter. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action resolving tension: Fourth stanza shows \"Clip-snap! The chase is brayer-won; ... The inky thrumblewock is done...\" The action of winning/chasing down the foe is clear. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Fifth stanza describes resting and fading daydreams but no explicit jubilant acknowledgment or triumphant return. It ends with a warning or reflection. No clear celebration or homecoming.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: brayerwock, rollish, chaseful, puddlewraith, paperclock, sprockle, pressive, trundlewight, squidge, smearlins, gloomerlight, swivel, krindle-swish, slappertap, flexisnout, smear-for-smear, quangle, clip-snap, brayer-won, unblotch, deckle, splotch, rune, thrumblewock, aswoon, blottled.

Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: Brayerwock and thrumblewock appear. Brayerwock is the named antagonist similar to Jabberwock. The \"thrumblewock\" could be the same or another foe. One named creature entity present.

Return/celebration not clear. Arc mostly in canonical order but last beat is incomplete or ambiguous.

Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens detected: \"Beware,\" \"long,\" \"hand,\" and minor very common English words included, but few if any canonical nonce words reused from original poem. The presence of canonical tokens is ≤8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts approximate Jabberwocky’s pattern of ~8–9 syllables on longer lines and ~5–7 on shorter lines. Lines seem approx to match this pattern, for example stanza 1 lines: \"Beware the inky Brayerwock,\" (6 syll), \"With rollish tread and chaseful guile!\" (8), \"Through puddlewraith and paperclock\" (7), \"It leaves a sprockle trail.\" (6) — somewhat close but inconsistent. However, many stanzas show approximate pattern. At least 4 of 5 stanzas roughly follow. So syllable tightness met.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes vary (guile/trail, hand/strand, slappertap/map, done/aswoon, fade/require). The last stanza (5th) has \"fade\"/\"require\" which do not rhyme, so fails rhyme there, but overall several distinct rhyme pairs and no end word reused more than twice. Mostly yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No content word overly repeated; no single content word obviously overused. Coinages and other nouns are varied without high repetition frequency. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages have multiple distinct roots: brayer-, puddle-, paper-, sprock-, trund-, squidge-, smear-, glom-, krindle-, slap-, flexi-, clip-, brayer-, blot-, thrumbl-, etc. No single suffix or root dominates >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem clearly addresses a similar subject to \"Jabberwocky,\" with a creature named Brayerwock, a warning, preparation, battle, and aftermath. Matches topic well. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied layer is weak or ambiguous; poem reads more as action and fanciful wordplay than deep motif or undertone.

No direct canonical lexicon like brillig, slithy, toves, etc. So zero or very few canonical tokens, definitely ≤8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines ~8–9 syll, shorter lines ~5–7 syll per stanza of 4 lines.  \nSamples: Lines like “Whiffling dusk goes sniving down,” (6 syllables?), “While drindle-wings entwine the sky;” (7), so slight undershoot, but some lines longer: e.g. “With nettle-cowl and stoppel stick,” (7) etc.  \nOverall line lengths approximate but often a bit short; does not strongly meet Jabberwocky pattern, so no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme varied with no exact end word reused >2 times excluding ring echo?  \nRhyme words: sky/cry, flash/dash, fall/bawl, cast/fast, bare/grow (no), host/post, fear/near, light/flight.  \nNo rhyme words repeated more than twice; diverse rhyme endings.

Some approximations/slant rhymes. No obvious AABB dominance; mostly ABAB or ABAC variants. More than 60% rhyme (2,4) -> yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes the first with repeated words/phrases: Yes, final stanza repeats \"‘Twas nummish night\", \"pewter ribbon\", and similar phraseology echoing the first stanza's structure and key words (\"pewtermink\", \"ribbon\", \"blay/lozzle blay\"). At least 2 repeated content words present; clear ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition/warning to protagonist: Present in stanza 2, with repeated \"Beware the Pewtermink, my child!\" and warnings about snergle-fork, blitherblench, ribbon-writh. Fits the admonition role.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament before encounter: Present in stanza 3 where protagonist \"snasped her zintle, zipped her vest, / Her fingers fretted foonsome thread\"—this is clearly preparatory actions before seeking the foe.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: Present in stanza 4 \"And as in nummish knots she andled, / The Pewtermink... Sprand from the bramble\"; clear meeting between protagonist and adversary.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action resolving tension: Stanza 5 describes sound of battle (\"Blim-blam! went zintle\") and \"snuffed the glim from minkle-sight\" implying the foe was subdued/killed -> decisive action present.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: Stanza 6 shows \"Have you unprongled it? O sproutish day! / Yiff-zents! Zuggle!

Clearly well above 8 distinct invented coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Is there ≥1 coinage in each stanza? Most stanzas contain multiple coined words: Yes, each stanza includes at least one distinct coinage (e.g. Pewtermink in 1st, snergle-fork in 2nd, zintle in 3rd, sprand in 4th, blim-blam in 5th, unprongled in 6th, nummish and lozzle in last stanza). So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named and central other than “Jabberwock”: Named Pewtermink is the central figure and adversary; clearly a non-canonical creature central to the poem’s action.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: At least two onomatopoeic bursts are present: \"Blim-blam!\" and \"snasped\" (possibly), also \"zuggle\" and \"quabble-loon\" sound onomatopoeic; \"Blim-blam!\" is clear; \"snasped\" less definite but likely intended as onomatopoeia. At least two onomatopoeic bursts found.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in at least two stanzas: Examples include “snasped her zintle, zipped her vest”, “fingers fretted foonsome thread”, “shimmer-dabble crest / shimmer-sloopers”, “snuffle-swish”. At least two stanzas have strong alliteration/consonance beyond incidental.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order (warning -> prep -> encounter -> decisive -> return): Clearly the poem follows this order: stanza 2 (warning), stanza 3 (preparation), stanza 4 (encounter), stanza 5 (decisive), stanza 6 (return/celebration). Thus, canonical arc order satisfied.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: No line matches exactly any line from the canonical poem; wording and coinages are distinct; no verbatim borrowings detected after normalizing whitespace/quotes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token budget ≤8: The poem uses a few canonical words (Beware, and, the) but does not reuse canonical lexicon like toves, borogoves, or similar. Minimal canonical tokens used; likely ≤8 distinct canonical tokens, favoring new coinages.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines mostly around 8-9 syllables (e.g. stanza 1 line 2: \"Sly-smither slid through lollop blay;\" =8 syllables). Shorter lines mostly about 5-7 syllables; pattern roughly matches Jabberwocky’s (~8 and ~6 syllable alternation). No obvious violations per stanza; so yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety (no more than 2 repeats of same rhyme ending across stanzas): End rhymes mostly distinct and slant rhymes vary; no exact repeated end-word rhyme >2 times excluding ring echo stanza. Appears acceptable rhyme variety.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No content word overused >5 times or >8% of content words; the coinages dilute repeated usage; no excessive lexical repetition detected.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages span multiple distinct roots (Pewtermink, snasped, glimly, blim-blam, florn, slotch, snuffed, unprongled, yiff-zents, quabble-loon, tumwy, coonsal), suffix or prefixes not dominated by a single pattern; at least 4 distinct root forms well represented; suffix repetition not >50%.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses the Jabberwocky style and content by naming a Jabberwock-like creature \"Pewtermink\", the narrative structure matches the original poem’s battle and return, no substitution of topic.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied layer: Subtle undercurrent about a rite of passage or challenge; the notion of “ribbon” and “threads” suggests themes of coming of age or struggle with a wild force.

The model poem lines mostly have fairly even length and content density; not strongly alternated lines visible; not clearly ≥60%. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (lines 2 and 4) mostly rhyme: spawn/vein (slant), will/trill (perfect), went/dissolve (not rhyme), groove/move (perfect), song/long (perfect), lane/grain (perfect). 4 of 6 have (2,4) rhymes, but one stanza (#3) breaks rhyme, and last stanza's rhyme is repeated ('lane'/'grain') - no strong avoidance of AABB dominance since stanzas mostly AABB or strong rhymes 2/4 but some single slant rhymes. The poem lacks diversity of rhyme schemes but has at least 60% rhyme on 2,4. So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza repeats the opening title phrase or clear refrain? No repeated content words or phrase echoing the first stanza except the word \"Quarter-Sawn\". Only one word repeated, no clear ring echo. So no.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Admonition early: \"Beware the glinting Quarter-Sawn,\" is a direct admonition phrase early on (1st stanza), so yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: \"Take up your flexle-strung guitar, And furb your fretful will:\" is clearly a preparation step before encounter (2nd stanza), so yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: In stanza 3 and 4, lines describe the shimmer moving \"through starble\" and \"Skryrr!\" sound of haggle-wood, chords played to confront shimmer-wraiths, so yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: \"You stole the shimmer’s song; Its jazzened lilt ... lay quiet,\" (5th stanza) is clearly a decisive resolution of conflict, so yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: The 6th stanza has \"O blest return! ... The fret-light leaves the lane,\" joyful ending implying a return and calm, so yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count of distinct invented coinages: jazzle, swardled, nyther, chitter-vein, flexle, furb, shimmer-wraiths, glimbles, lownsome, skryrr, haggle-wood, thickle, dwamble, jazzened, fret-light, starble. Many coinages present, well over 8 distinct, so yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza has at least one coinage word (e.g., jazzle, swardled, nyther spawn; flexle-strung, furb; lownsome, starble; skryrr, haggle-wood; dwamble, jazzened; fret-light), so yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: \"Quarter-Sawn\" is a named non-canonical creature/entity central to poem, yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"Skryrr!\" is a clear onomatopoeic burst; no obvious second onomatopoeic burst (no \"Pop!\", \"Snicker-snack!\" or similar), so no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Multiple stanzas (e.g., stanza 1 \"glinting Quarter-Sawn,\" jazzle flicks; stanza 2 \"flexle-strung\", \"fretful will\"; stanza 4 \"flared your chord\" \"heart too swift to move\") show clear notable alliteration/consonance; at least 2 stanzas, so yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Admonition (1), prep (2), encounter (3-4), decisive act (5), return/celebration (6) in canonical order, so yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines verbatim from canonical poem. Distinct wording, no exact line matches found after normalization, so yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexicon budget ≤8: The poem includes no canonical words except the very generic \"And\" and \"the\". Words like \"Beware\" and \"O\" are standard English, and canonical coined words like \"vorpal\" or \"Jabberwock\" are absent. So canonical tokens ≤8, yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines generally 8-9 syllables (e.g., line 2 of stanza 1 \"Whose jazzle flicks the grain!\" [6-7] maybe slightly short but mostly close), shorter lines approx 5-7 syllables. Mostly fits Jabberwocky pattern within quatrains, yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme words mostly differ across stanzas (grain, trill, dissolve, move, long, grain). \"grain\" repeated twice (first and last stanza). Thus one rhyme reused twice is acceptable. No more than two repetitions excluding ring echo. Satisfactory rhyme variety, so yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overused—\"quarter-sawn\" appears mainly as titular, other content words rarely repeated excessively. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages have many distinct roots: jazzle, swardled, nyther, chitter, flexle, furb, shimmer, wraith, glimble, lownsome, skryrr, haggle, thickle, dwamble, jazzened, fret-light, starble. At least 4 distinct roots, good variety, yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly is about a creature/\"Quarter-Sawn\" and a protagonist confronting it; theme matches quest/encounter typical of Jabberwocky. Clear topic adherence, yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Implied undertone of struggle with elusive shimmering foe, musical/creative metaphor layered beneath action, coherent motif of music vs. creature.

Yes.</C1_think>\n<C2_think>Counting stanzas: There are 8 stanzas; all stanzas have 4 lines each (quatrains). Total stanza count between 5 and 8 inclusive. Yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter check: Jabberwocky uses alternating longer (~8-9 syll) and shorter (~5-7 syll) lines per stanza. Counting a sample:  \n- Stanza1 lines: 7-8-7-7 (mostly 7 syll) no clear strong alternating pattern  \n- Stanza5 lines: “And ss—sssshwish!”(3 syll), “Through pickerpearl,”(4 syll), “The Brinehiss slunk: a hiss-sod seam,”(8 syll), “Its glitzering gowl in twizzle-whirl”(8 syll) — only partly alternating, pattern weak  \nOverall, in less than 60% of stanzas do lines alternate longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content words difference. No.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme pattern in stanzas: Most have rhyme in lines 2 and 4 (e.g., twine/wild; foam/home; line/spine; tow/rolled; seam/dream; leap/asleep; knot/road; pine/brine). Not all AABB; some contain slant rhyme. At least 60% stanzas have (2,4) rhyme. Yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Opening stanza warns “Beware the Quenching Brinehiss,” last stanza repeats this admonition with similar wording and phrasing (almost identical line starting with “Beware the Quenching Brinehiss, child:”). Well-defined refrain with ≥2 repeated content words. Yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition: In the first stanza and repeated final stanza, the warning “Beware the Quenching Brinehiss” is explicitly given. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: The protagonist \"snatched his dritnet, brinebound-cold\" and took \"barnacork and clask,\" indicating preparation and armament before encounter. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: Stanza 5 describes the Brinehiss slinking and stanza 6 depicts the fight (“One slash of barnacork...”), so clear confrontation present. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying or decisive action: The Brinehiss is subdued by a strike (\"One slash... shrilled and fell asleep\"), resolving the tension decisively. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: Final stanzas show the protagonist \"strode back\" with spoils, kelpstrings blinking along, but no overt jubilation or celebration language akin to “O frabjous day!” or joy. The final stanza is another warning rather than a triumphant return. Thus, no celebratory return. No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Coinages include “Brinehiss, plashclammle, dribble-dark, wratchles, nimsy, barnacork, clask, sissle, dritnet, glimberflaps, tumpy, beachgroves, driftwraiths, schurl, sloe, pickerpearl, glitzering, twizzle-whirl, slurmbled, snuffle, rummy, sleekerslime, brinebit, cleeked.” Easily ≥8 distinct new coinages.

Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: The “Quenching Brinehiss” is named and is the main adversary. “Blorrle” also appears but seems minor. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: “Ss—sssshwish!” in stanza 5 is a clear onomatopoeic burst. Another possible onomatopoeia is “snuffle” (stanza 6 is debatable, more imitative than pure onomatopoeia). Only one strongly clear onomatopoeia (\"ss—sssshwish!\"). Not at least two. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in at least two stanzas beyond incidental:  \n- Stanza 2: “plashclammle night was dribble-dark” (d, dr)  \n- Stanza 4: “stubby glimberflaps in tow” is weaker; “tumpy feet up beachgroves rolled” partial  \n- Stanza 5: “ss—sssshwish! Through pickerpearl,” strong s sound  \n- Stanza 6: “snuffle, rummy as the deep” (no strong alliteration)  \nAt least stanzas 2 and 5 have strong alliteration beyond incidental. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The poem follows canonical arc: warning (stanza 1), preparation (3,4), encounter (5), decisive action (6), return (7), ring admonition (8). Arc sequence acceptable. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line verbatim matches canonical poem lines, judging by distinct wording and coinages, also different phrasing and vocabulary. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexicon budget: Many canonical words (e.g. beware, son/child instead of son, jaws -> vapor-tendrils, etc.) replaced by coinages; fewer canonical tokens used (e.g., “Beware” and “child” is English, but minimal canonical words like “hiss” or “snicker-snack” are not present). Canonical tokens definitely ≤8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable rhythm: Longer lines should be ~8-9 syll, shorter ~5-7 per stanza lines alternating. Checking first stanza:  \nLine 1: “Beware the Quenching Brinehiss, child,” = 7 syllables  \nLine 2: “Its vapor-tendrils twirl and twine!” = 8 syllables  \nLine 3: “In brackish gloaming, sleek and wild,” = 8 syllables  \nLine 4: “It soaks the soul with tangling brine.” = 8 syllables  \nNo clear longer/shorter alternating 8/6 pattern. Many stanzas have mostly 7-8 syllables all around or not alternating patterns. Probably no. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhyme words in stanzas are different mostly; no exact end-word reused more than twice excluding the echo (e.g., “brine” used twice in ring chorus). Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single non-canonical content word appears excessively; “Brinehiss” is frequent but below 5 times or ~8% of content words (<8 stanzas). No overuse. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages show multiple roots and suffixes (e.g., “plashclammle,” “dribble-dark,” “wratchles,” “barnacork,” “glimberflaps,” “beachgroves,” “schurl,” “pickerpearl,” “twizzle-whirl”). No suffix or root dominates >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a “Jabberwocky”-style surreal poem with a named creature, a warning and confrontation, fitting the theme perfectly (likely intended as Jabberwocky-style). Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond surface narrative, there is a motif of fear, danger, youthful challenge, and returning from a trial with a warning, fitting an undertone of coming-of-age and peril. Coherent implied layer present.
