However, only about 4 out of 7 stanzas have clear rhymes at lines 2 and 4. Also, minimal risk of AABB dominance since the rhyme pattern mostly fits ballad rhyme.

mostly ABAB or ABAB-like rhyme pattern maintained.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza repeats \"Kiridashine\" matching the first stanza’s \"Kiridashine\"; at least two repeated content words (\"Kiridashine\", \"whispers\") appear, serving as a ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present: \"Beware its edge that slices fine\" and \"Be wary, child, of Kiridash’s blight\" are clear cautionary warnings early.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation occurs with protagonist taking \"leather scabbard bared\" and resolving mentally for confrontation; showing tool/resolve before encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter described: \"The Kiridashine gleamed its sheen\" and \"Its grating snore a rasping cluck\" indicate clear meeting of protagonist and creature.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive act: \"And with a swipe both quick and keen, The Kiridash was wholly cleane\" depicts slaying or decisive resolution.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return or celebration: Stanza 7 describes departure triumphant (\"Triumphant then, the woods he left\") and advancing towards dawn; jubilation or success implied.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Counted coinages: \"Kiridashine,\" \"Kiridash,\" \"fiendish,\" \"shrouded,\" \"wily prose\" (less coinage), mostly one main coinage \"Kiridashine\" root with some variations but likely less than 8 distinct coinages overall; some invented or unusual words but less than required distinct coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>At least 1 coinage (\"Kiridashine\" or derivative) in every stanza, present throughout the poem.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature named \"Kiridashine,\" central to the story and action; distinct from canonical Jabberwock or known canonical nonsense creatures.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeic bursts: \"grating snore a rasping cluck\" could be considered onomatopoeia, but no strong clear bursts like \"snicker-snack\" or \"burbled\"; less than 2 distinct onomatopoeic bursts.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance seen particularly in stanza 1 (\"shadows creep,\" \"slices fine\"), stanza 5 (\"breath did halt,\" \"moonlight struck,\" \"swipe swift and keen\"), and some others; at least 2 stanzas with clear alliteration/consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order is correct: warning/admonition (stanzas 1-2), preparation (3), encounter (4), decisive act (5), return/celebration (6-7), ring echo (8).</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No exact lines match canonical poem; vocabulary and lines are new, no verbatim reuse found.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Very limited canonical tokens: no canonical nonsense words, no \"vorpal,\" \"Jubjub,\" or other canonical names; canonical tokens likely zero or negligible—within budget.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Long lines approximate ~8-9 syllables and short lines ~5-7 syllables consistently within each quatrain stanza, matching Jabberwocky’s syllable pattern tightly.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme words (line 2,4) are varied across stanzas; no exact rhyme word repeated more than twice; rhyme variety sufficient.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No excessive repetition of any single content word excluding ring echo; \"Kiridashine\" repeated reasonably as a proper noun; no word overused >5 times or >8% of content words.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show low root variety; largely variations on \"Kiridash\" root; does not satisfy requirement of ≥4 distinct coinage roots with distribution; one major root dominates.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem clearly addresses the given topic: a narrative about a creature \"Kiridashine\" and battle in its style; coherent and consistent subject matching Jabberwocky theme.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext is present in implied motif of challenge and mastery, symbolic battle with creative/artistic \"scribe line\" metaphor; underlying motif of triumph over a fearsome or elusive foe.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.875, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 0.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.875, "criteria_yes": 21, "label": "high"}
