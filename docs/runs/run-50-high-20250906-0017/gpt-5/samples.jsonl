Stanza count (8) is between 5 and 8 inclusive. Condition met.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter: In Jabberwocky lines alternate ~8 and ~6 syllables with 2+ content word difference. Examining the model: roughly, lines alternate longer/shorter, e.g. first stanza lines vary around 8-9 syll and 5-7 syll, and content words count appears to differ by 2 or more in lines 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4. This pattern appears consistent in ≥60% of stanzas. So yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme: In Jabberwocky, the 2nd and 4th lines rhyme, often allowing slant rhymes, and AABB rhyme scheme is generally avoided. Examining the model: the rhyme on lines 2 and 4 is consistent in most stanzas (e.g., \"stick\"/\"tick\", \"thumbs\"/\"hums\", \"pins\"/\"grins\", etc.). Occasionally the pattern is ABCB but no strong dominance of AABB. This meets ≥60% rhyme(2,4) and avoids AABB dominance.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza echoes the first stanza with repeated content words and phrases (\"leadlings lay\", \"click-clacking\", \"composing stick\", \"quoined array\", \"glimmercases\", and ticking). At least two repeated content words and a clear refrain pattern exist.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition: Present in stanza 2 (\"Take heed, apprentice: guard your thumbs; the Kerningwyrm craves pressroom flesh; its ink-lashed spit shall thee enmesh.\") Clear cautious warning to protagonist early in poem.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: Stanza 3 clearly shows preparation (\"gauged my stick to one em wide, with guttergloves and pica-pins; I lipped each slug and snugged beside…\"). The protagonist is readying tools and preparing before encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: Stanza 4 describes the adversary approaching with vivid action (\"Through casescape the Kerningwyrm came sizzle-sly with jellied breath; its ligature-lapping squirm made makereadies gasp of death.\"). So yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: Stanzas five and six describe the fight and the kill (\"I raised my stick, chaseling-blade;…skreek! skrrk!…I pinched its tail… snapped its beak… kerning cracked in two.\"). This is a decisive resolution.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Stanza seven shows return with \"Back to the stone I steady-stepped, with proof-slip, pelt, and letter-lore; the foreman winked; the formes were kept, and sang old shopfloor lore once more.\" The foreman wink and the preservation of the formes indicate successful, joyful conclusion.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Invented words distinct from canonical and common English such as \"leadlings,\" \"Kerningwyrm,\" \"glimmercases,\" \"guttergloves,\" \"pica-pins,\" \"chaseling-blade,\" \"makereadies,\" \"proof-slip,\" \"letter-lore,\" \"steady-stepped,\" \"crink,\" \"quoins,\" \"jellied breath,\" \"ligature-lapping,\" \"chock and chase\" (used as coined compounds) total to at least 8 distinct coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza contains at least one coinage word; e.g., \"leadlings,\" \"Kerningwyrm,\" \"glimmercases,\" \"guttergloves,\" \"chaseling-blade,\" \"proof-slip,\" \"foreman,\" \"steady-stepped,\" \"click-clacking,\" etc., so yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: The adversary is called \"Kerningwyrm,\" a novel creature name not canonical or appearing in Jabberwocky. It is central to the action.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Syllabic bursts or exclamations like \"click-clacking,\" \"sizzle-sly,\" \"skreek! skrrk!,\" \"chk-CHK!\" appear multiple times, well over 2. So yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Multiple stanzas show internal alliteration, e.g. stanza 1: \"leadlings lay,\" \"picas pale,\" stanza 2: \"craves pressroom,\" \"ink-lashed spit,\" stanza 6: \"case,\" \"cracked,\" \"kerning,\" and elsewhere. At least 2 stanzas with clear alliteration/consonance present.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning (stanza 2), Preparation (3), Encounter (4), Decisive action (5-6), Return/celebration (7) appear in correct canonical narrative order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: The model contains none of the exact canonical lines from Jabberwocky, normalized for spacing/dashes/quotes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token budget: The poem uses a handful of canonical tokens (e.g. \"and,\" \"in,\" \"the,\" \"he,\" \"with,\" \"his,\" \"to,\" \"he\"). The canonical Jabberwocky words themselves (brillig, slithy, toves, etc.) do not appear. So canonical token count ≤8.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines mostly 8–9 syllables, shorter lines 5–7 syllables, similar to \"Twas brillig\" pattern, consistently across all stanzas with quatrains, appears to hold strictly.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The rhymes at (2,4) across stanzas vary, e.g. \"stick/tick,\" \"thumbs/hums,\" \"pins/grins,\" \"breath/death,\" \"blade/sang,\" \"chase/true,\" \"stepped/kept,\" \"tick.\" No exact rhyming word is reused more than twice, excluding ring echo stanza.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No content word is excessively repeated over 5 times or 8% of content words. Words like \"stick,\" \"leadlings\" appear often but within limits.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages are from multiple distinct roots: \"leadlings,\" \"Kerningwyrm,\" \"glimmercases,\" \"guttergloves,\" \"chaseling-blade,\" \"makereadies,\" \"proof-slip,\" \"steady-stepped,\" \"click-clacking,\" etc. Coined suffixes are diverse; no one suffix accounts for >50%.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a typesetting/printing topic with action centered on the \"Kerningwyrm,\" a threatening mythical creature in the printing shop metaphor. It does not substitute a different subject. So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is an implied motif of apprentice struggle and mastery in printing/typing, a metaphorical fight with challenges (\"Kerningwyrm\") in the craft, giving coherent undertones of craft, learning, and victory beyond surface action.</C24_think>\n</think>\n\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 1.0, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 1.0, "criteria_yes": 24, "label": "high"}

So yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>The arc of warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration appears clearly in canonical order: 2nd stanza warning, 3rd preparation, 5th-6th encounter, 7th decisive action, 8th return/celebration. So yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines exactly match the canonical 'Jabberwocky' poem lines on normalization; all wording is new or changed. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens appearing are minimal and ≤8: \"Beware\", \"he\", \"and\", possibly \"with\" (common English). No direct use of canonical coinages. Thus canonical budget usage is low. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: most longer lines are around 8-9 syllables, shorter lines around 5-7 in nearly every quatrain, matching Jabberwocky pattern. So yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety in lines 2,4: many stanzas use distinct rhymes, rarely repeating the same rhyme end-words more than twice.

So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition is well controlled: no single content word or coinage is repeated excessively outside the ring echo. The coined words are varied and content words do not appear >5 times or >8% in the poem. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: several distinct roots are clear—wow, flutter, hiss, splice, demag, capstan, felt-pad, whippled, pinch-roller, waver-waffled, stretchling, etc.—indicating ≥4 distinct roots. No single suffix dominates. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>The poem clearly addresses the topic (a playful, stylized encounter with the \"Wowfluther,\" mimicking Jabberwocky’s style and theme). The subject is consistent and no substitution occurs. So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>There is an implied subtext of battling technological imperfections or glitches (wow, flutter, hiss, tape issues) with resolve and skill, an undertone of overcoming technical challenges metaphorically.
