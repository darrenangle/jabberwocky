No.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition or warning: First stanza lines: \"A warning wove through whisper sigh / The Glumbrax roars beyond the rim / Its thunder din cracks silent brim\"  \nContains warning atmosphere, but no explicit admonition phrase like \"Beware…\" or equivalent direct caution to protagonist. So effectively no clear admonition.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation or armament before encounter: Presence of protagonist preparing or arming before confrontation:  \n\"We bind the prayer‑flagged steel grit / And wear the gristly boots of grit\" indicates preparation and armament.

Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: Final lines show descending and wind sighing, \"We turn, descend, the world sings bright,\"  \nSuggests return. \"Hearts grow light, high\" suggests positive feeling, but no jubilant direct celebration or acknowledgement like \"O frabjous day!\" or direct exultation. Ambiguous, but below threshold for jubilation.

At least two stanzas with some notable alliteration/consonance. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning -> Preparation -> Encounter -> Decisive act -> Return  \nText roughly goes: warning implied in first stanza, preparation in second, encounter in third stanza, decisive act next lines, then return at end. but some arc beats are compressed or implied. Overall roughly canonical order preserved. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: no lines exactly matching canonical poem after normalization. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token budget ≤8: This poem hardly uses canonical tokens: no \"brillig\", \"slithy\", \"toves\" etc except \"beam\" in \"bright, fierce blade\" (beamish not present). So canonical tokens zero or very few, yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Check syllable count for quatrain lines match jabberwocky ~8–9 for longer lines, ~5–7 for shorter, alternating:  \nLines mostly between 5 and 8 syllables roughly, but no consistent alternation in length per stanza.

Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Only 2–3 clear roots in coinages (Glumbrax, Glimmertide, prayer-flagged compounds). Not ≥4 distinct roots. No.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Clearly focused on a climactic mountain ascent with a creature called Glumbrax and prayer flags—distinct from \"Jabberwocky\" but centered on confrontation with a creature, so thematic adherence to confrontation subject, but no direct Jabberwocky subject named. Since task is matching style of Jabberwocky, the topic is typically battle with a named creature; the poem diverges topic. Uncertain if full topic match required, but poem substitutes different creature and scenario, not Jabberwock. Strict interpretation yields no.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied layer: underlying themes of perseverance, spirituality (prayer flags), nature's power, overcoming adversity are implied.

Four distinct roots appear (loomspick, whorton, thwap, sward) → yes</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly about a Jabberwocky-style poem with loomspick as adversary, matching the original theme of a fearsome creature battle → yes</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied layer?

Here, rhyme pattern is mostly ABAB or ABAB-like not AABB? But lines 2 and 4 rhyme, so corresponds mostly with ABAB since line 1/3 doesn't rhyme; line 1 rhymes sometimes with line 3, but here no.  \nThe poem uses a strong rhyme on 2 and 4 each stanza, which matches Jabberwocky's pattern. The rhyme pattern seems consistent and no obvious AABB dominance.  \nYes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza repeats 2+ content words/phrases from the first stanza as a ring: \"Beware the flash of marble's glare\" is repeated exactly in last line.

Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Does the protagonist prepare before the encounter?  \nStanza 2: \"I craft shield of flint and fizzle / And curl my steps with whirling wind\" implies preparation using a shield and preparing steps, also resting somehow. This counts as preparation or armament before encounter. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter between protagonist and adversary?  \nStanza 3: \"At last I see Inlay's fierce grin / It bellows crackle-clack, a clang\" → the protagonist sees the adversary (Inlay), who is named. This shows clear confrontation. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive resolution?  \nStanza 4: \"With flint-blade I strike Inlay's core / A roar erupts, the stone obeys / Its crystal heart bursts a fierce core / World quivers, shattered stone obeys\" → decisive strike that resolves conflict. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return or celebration?  \nStanza 5: \"Now I trek back through glint-gray haze / My armor clinks with humming glare / I whisper thanks to fading haze\" → indicates return journey after conflict; subtle acknowledgement but subdued celebration, more like a somber thanks. There is return but no jubilant celebration as in canonical poem.  \nBorderline but not clearly jubilant or joyful; the tone is quiet gratitude, not celebration. No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages count?  \nCoinages: \"Pietra Dura Inlay\" (artistic name, probably proper noun), \"fizzle\", \"snarling snare\" (snarling is English, snare is English), \"flint and fizzle\" (fizzle used twice?), \"whirling wind\" (English), \"sizzle\" (English), \"night-shard\" (compound coinage), \"flint-blade\" (compound), many repeats but unique coined roots: \"fizzle\", \"whirling\", \"sizzle\", \"night-shard\", \"flint-blade\", \"glint-gray\".  \nTotal distinct coinages: fewer than 8 distinct invented coinages; many are compound or English words with minor coinage. \"flint\", \"glint\", \"clang\", \"sizzle\" are English or onomatopoetic.  \nLikely <8 distinct truly invented coinages. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Does each stanza contain at least 1 coinage?  \nStanza 1: \"snarling snare\" may be borderline: \"snarling\" English adjective, \"snare\" English noun. No clear coinage.  \nStanza 2: \"fizzle\" appears twice (coinage).  \nStanza 3: \"clang\" onomatopoeia, not coined lexeme but countable for onomatopoeia, but not coinage.  \nStanza 4: \"flint-blade\" compound (could count as coinage).  \nStanza 5: \"glint-gray\" compound, arguably coined compound.  \nStanza 6: repeats previous line (ring), no clear coinage.  \nSome stanzas lack any clear coinage. So no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Is a named non-canonical creature/entity central to action (not \"Jabberwock\")?  \nInlay is named and central to conflict as adversary. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts (≥2) present?  \nWords like \"sizzle\", \"crackle-clack\", \"clang\", \"roar\" appear. \"crackle-clack\" and \"clang\" both onomatopoeic bursts. At least 2 distinct onomatopoeic bursts present. Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas beyond incidental?  \nExamples:  \nStanza 1: \"marble's glare\", \"spells that slither\", strong s- alliteration.  \nStanza 2: \"craft shield of flint and fizzle\" (f alliteration), \"curl my steps with whirling wind\" (w alliteration).  \nThus at least 2 stanzas with clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order canonical? (Warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration)  \nStanza 1: Warning (admonition) → yes  \nStanza 2: Preparation → yes  \nStanza 3: Encounter → yes  \nStanza 4: Decisive act → yes  \nStanza 5: Return → yes  \nStanza 6: Ring echo  \nOrder is correct. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines?  \nCompared lines to canonical poem. No exact line matches despite similarity in theme and wording; no line fully matching canonical lines. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexicon distinct tokens ≤8 (only known Jabberwocky words allowed ≤8)?  \nThe poem uses only a few canonical words if any: \"Beware\" (common), no obvious canonical coinage words like \"brillig\", \"slithy\", \"toves\", etc. Canonical token usage is low or none, so ≤8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines ~8-9 syllables, shorter lines ~5-7 syllables in each quatrain?  \nCheck stanza 1: \"Beware the flash of marble's glare\" (8 syllables), \"For spells that slither in the stone\" (8 syll), \"Its artful gleam, a snarling snare\" (8 syll) \"Those who heed find doom on hard stone\" (8 syll) — no shorter lines, all roughly 8 syllables → no alternating short-long.  \nOther stanzas similarly close to 8 syllables per line, without consistent alternating longer/shorter lines per stanza. Does not meet the pattern across all stanzas. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: 2,4 line rhymes varied; no end word reused >2 times excluding ring echo?  \n\"glare\" repeated stanza 1 and 6 (ring echo) acceptable.  \n\"clang\" repeated twice stanza 3 (lines 2 and 4).  \n\"obeys\" repeated twice stanza 4.  \n\"haze\" repeated stanza 5 (lines 1/3) and twice there. Not excessive repetition, no end word reused in more than 2 stanzas except ring echo. Rhyme words fairly varied. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no content word used >5 times or >8% overall?  \nRepetitions: \"Beware\" twice, \"glare\" twice, \"stone\" thrice; no excessive overuse. Lexical repetition low. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: ≥4 distinct roots, no single suffix >50%?  \nCoinages limited overall and not many suffix-based coinages. Roots distinct but less than 8 total coinages, likely >4 distinct types: \"fizzle\", \"sizzle\", \"night-shard\", \"flint-blade\", \"glint-gray\" roots, so at least 4 distinct roots. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem addresses a conflict with a named fantastical entity \"Inlay\", warning, battle, and return. The poem's topic aligns with \"Jabberwocky\" style (invented entity, fantastic conflict) though not about Jabberwock itself or canonical creatures. It matches the style with invented creature and adventure, so topic adhered to. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: a coherent implied layer?  \nThe poem implies a motif of peril and overcoming an enchanted or cursed stone art (Inlay), with warnings and struggle, and cautious return. Underlying theme can be read as overcoming dangers in art or obstacles, somewhat subtle and consistent. A faint but present undertone is there. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.7916666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.7916666666666666, "criteria_yes": 19, "label": "medium"}

Rhyme (2,4) mostly not observed; instead (1,2) and (3,4) often rhyming. So it fails the required rhyme pattern of (2,4) rhyming and avoiding dominant AABB.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza repeats the first line's content: \"Beware the sly Snivertor’s howl at night.\" and echoes the caution tone.

However final line repeats the warning, which slightly undercuts a full jubilant tone but still presence of return and acknowledgment. So yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented coinages: Snivertor, collet, zizz, twining, blurt, blundered, crimson haze, clanks. Some seem coined, others may be normal words. At least 8 distinct invented coinages including Snivertor, collet, zizz, blurt, blundered (borderline?), clanks (borderline?); \"crimson haze\" is normal words. Possibly enough for 8 distinct. Conservative count yields borderline but probably just enough distinct coined forms.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Check if each stanza has ≥1 coinage.  \n1: Snivertor  \n2: collet, grain (grain normal), zizz  \n3: Snivertor, clatter (normal), collet, twining  \n4: blurt, blundered (arguable coinage), crimson haze  \n5: clanks  \n6: collet  \nEvery stanza seems to have at least one coined term or nonce word (\"blurt\", \"blundered\", \"zizz\", \"snivertor\", \"collet\", \"twining\").

Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (1), preparation (2), encounter (3), decisive action (4), return (5) - correct order. The 6th stanza is a closing echo line - acceptable. So arc order maintained.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines exactly match canonical poem lines after normalization. All lines are original. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used include: beware, vorpal (not used), not used actually. Only “Beware” appears similarly but it's generic. No canonical lexicon except \"beware\" which is normal English word. So canonical token count ≤8, favoring new coinages. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines ~8-9 syllables, shorter ~5-7 syllables.\n\nExamples stanza 1: line 1 (Beware the sly Snivertor’s howl at night,) ~9 syllables  \nline 2 (His fangs of froth flick bright in moon’s pale light,) ~10 syllables  \nline 3 (He stalks where quiet leaves of balance sway,) ~9 syllables  \nline 4 (And twists the spring of silence—none may stay.) ~9 syllables  \nLines fairly even length; not clear longer/shorter alternation per stanza.\n\nJabberwocky is ballad meter: alternating 8 and 6 syll:\n\nHere line lengths do not clearly alternate or fit 8/6 pattern in every stanza. No consistent syllable tightness. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The rhymes in (2,4) are not dominant, often AABB rhyme scheme is repeated. The end rhymes are fairly varied; no end word is repeated more than twice, and the final stanza repeats the first line phrase as ring echo only. Thus rhyme variety is good. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: Unique content words are varied; no single content word is overused. \"Snivertor\" appears multiple times but less than 5 or 8% of content words. No overuse. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages include Snivertor, collet, zizz, blurt, blundered (borderline), twining (borderline), clanks, crimson haze (normal words but considered descriptive). At least 4 distinct roots in coinages to count as distinct. \"Snivertor\", \"collet\", \"zizz\", \"blurt\" are distinct roots. No one suffix dominates. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly treats a thematic narrative of protagonist facing a named creature Snivertor with weapon (collet), warning and battle, which matches the Jabberwocky topic (fantastical monster confrontation). Thus topic adhered to without drifting. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem includes motif of balance, spring, silence, and renewal, implying themes of restoring equilibrium beyond surface monster fight.

Hence fails quatrain shape uniformity.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Checking meter alternation (longer and shorter lines) in ≥60% stanzas.

Stanza 4: glee/glee? Only 2 lines, no 2/4 rhyme needed. Stanza 6: back/home/dire/dire rhymes partially but \"home\" doesn't rhyme with \"dire\"; 2nd and 4th lines rhyme? \"home\"/\"dire\" no. Overall rhyme pattern does not reliably fulfill requirement (>60% rhymes (2,4) without AABB dominance).

Final stanza repeats \"stubble,\" \"home,\" and warns \"beware Skyrisk Wyrm\" recalling the warning in first stanza \"Beware the Skyrisk Wyrm.\" So yes, a loose ring composition is present.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present in stanza 1: \"Beware the Skyrisk Wyrm...\" This is a clear caution to the protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation and armament: stanza 2 shows the protagonist preparing with \"I tightened my flaxen blade,\" \"forged a grawlix shield,\" and \"sang grimy chant of whifflume fear.\" So yes, preparation before encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: stanza 3 clearly depicts the meeting - \"The Wyrm rose, its eyes blaze,\" \"Sizzle-snaps of wing,\" and \"Skyrisk Wyrm roared.\" So yes, clear encounter.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying decisive action: stanza 4 contains \"I struck the beast, a flash of glee,\" \"The Wyrm fell.\" This shows the decisive resolution.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: stanza 5-6 show the protagonist returning home, \"trekked back through hush,\" \"Murmur swarms hummed above, leading me back home,\" \"I whisper still, beware Skyrisk Wyrm...\" There is no jubilant celebration, rather a mournful or wary tone. So no celebration present.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: distinct invented words: Skyrisk, Wyrm, snerks, grawlix, whifflume, sizzle-snaps (semi-coinage), murmur swarms (maybe more common words), flaxen (existing word), grawlix shield, snerks.

So canonical tokens ≤8, yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts roughly in 8–9 (longer) and 5–7 (shorter) for alternating lines, per stanza: lines have irregular lengths and no clear alternating pattern with consistent syllable counts as in Jabberwocky. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: few end-rhyme pairs repeated; some end words reused more than twice (\"dire\" used 3 times), borderline but >2 times rule fails here. So no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no notable overuse of single content words beyond allowed frequency (except \"dire\" repeated 3 times in 23+ lines, not over 5 times or 8%).

Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied layer: the poem suggests themes of fear, battle, survival, and ongoing caution; presence of \"chant,\" \"tempering heart,\" and ending warning implies subtle motifs of vigilance beyond surface.

Only 5 stanzas have 4 lines; others 2 lines. The requirement is all stanzas are quatrains and total stanzas between 5 and 8. Here all stanzas are not quatrains, total stanza count is 9. So no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter requires ≥60% stanzas with lines alternating long/short pattern with ≥2 content words difference. Many stanzas are 2 lines long, so can't assess quatrain alternating pattern. Among 4-line stanzas, pattern is inconsistent or unclear. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme in ≥60% of stanzas (2,4) with avoiding AABB dominance. Some rhyme is present, e.g. \"Grindle-flog\"/\"jog\", but stanza rhyme schemes vary and some stanzas have no rhyme (some have 2 lines only). Likely does not reach 60% with (2,4) rhyme in quatrains. So no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza is a 4-line stanza, but no clear ring composition phrase or repeated content words/phrases echoing the first stanza. The first stanza mentions \"parrel bead on gaff,\" last stanza repeats \"parrel bead\" and \"gaff,\" partially echoing first stanza. At least 2 repeated content words (\"parrel bead,\" \"gaff\") appear in first and last stanzas—might count as ring echo.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Second stanza contains admonition \"Beware, the snarling Grindle-flog,\" an explicit warning to protagonist. So yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Third stanza shows protagonist preparing: \"I girded my spangle-strap of steel,\" \"called the zindle scribes swift,\" \"gear the whirly-grift swift\" — preparation with tools and planning before encounter. So yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Fourth stanza shows encounter: \"Then surged the Glimmergrub from dusk,\" attacking. So yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Fifth stanza shows decisive action: protagonist \"swung my spattered-spike of rune, And cleaved the gloom with shining rune,\" the creature \"screeched, Zar! hiss,\" splinters fell. Decisive action resolving conflict. So yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Sixth stanza shows return/celebration: \"I seized the bead... fled... folk all sang his name with cheer, and placed the bead upon the mayor's cheer.\" Return and celebration present. So yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Counting coinages (invented words not canonical or standard English): parrel, gaff, Grindle-flog, snarling, spangle-strap, blazeful, zindle, scribes (common English, so no), whirly-grift, Glimmergrub, flindering, flapper-flaw, spattered-spike, rune (standard English word but in context may be fantasy, counting cautiously), Zar (onomatopoeia or name), sibil hiss (hiss is common English), so at least 8 distinct coinages: parrel, gaff, Grindle-flog, spangle-strap, blazeful, zindle, whirly-grift, Glimmergrub, flindering, flapper-flaw, spattered-spike. Definitely more than 8 distinct invented coinages. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza includes at least one coinage. Early stanzas have gaff; others have different coinages such as Grindle-flog, spangle-strap, zindle scribes, whirly-grift, Glimmergrub, flindering, flapper-flaw, spattered-spike, rune is ambiguous but appears in an instrumental sense; last stanzas repeat prior coinages. So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creature/entity: Grindle-flog and Glimmergrub. Grindle-flog is addressed in admonition; Glimmergrub is the creature that attacks and is slain. Both are not canonical. So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia check: \"shrieked, Zar! hiss,\" \"sibil hiss.\" Both \"Zar!\" and \"hiss\" are onomatopoeic bursts (though hiss is common English, the sibil hiss emphasizes sound). Two distinct onomatopoeic bursts. So yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance within two or more stanzas: Examples include \"spangle-strap of steel,\" \"zindle scribes swift,\" \"whirly-grift swift,\" \"spattered-spike of rune,\" \"sibil hiss.\" Multiple stanzas exhibit clear internal alliteration/consonance. So yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza 2) → preparation (3) → encounter (4) → decisive act (5) → return (6) → final stanza is an admonition or caution again, not repetition of arc. Order is preserved. So yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim matches to canonical lines after normalization. All lines are original with different words and coinages. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token count: The poem uses no canonical Lewis Carroll words from the canonical lexicon (brillig, slithy, toves, gyre, gimble, wabe, mimsy, borogoves, mome, raths, outgrabe, Jubjub, Bandersnatch, vorpal, manxome, Tumtum, uffish, whiffling, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish). No canonical coinages used, so canonical budget = 0 ≤ 8. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: alternatively longer (~8-9 syllables) and shorter (~5-7). Sample stanzas show inconsistent meter; e.g., first stanza lines have only 6 and 6 syllables; many lines too short or irregular. Meter is loose, not tight as in Jabberwocky. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhyme occurs with some words like \"grindle-flog\"/\"jog,\" \"steel\"/\"steel\" (repeated word), \"Zar! hiss\"/\"sibil hiss\" (repeated word \"hiss\"), \"free\"/\"free\", \"cheer\"/\"cheer\". So repeated end-words appear >2 times excluding ring echo. Variety is low. So no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: Words like \"gaff\" and \"steel\" appear multiple times but not overly frequent relative to total content words. No content word obviously overused >5 times or >8% frequency. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Do coinages show ≥4 distinct roots with no root dominating >50% coinages? Coinages have multiple distinct roots (parrel, gaff, Grindle-flog, spangle, blazeful, zindle, whirly-grift, Glimmergrub, flindering, flapper-flaw, spattered-spike). No single root or suffix dominates coinage. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem addresses a \"parrel bead on gaff,\" with a conflict against \"Grindle-flog\" and \"Glimmergrub,\" not the Jabberwock or canonical elements, but the topic is a fantastic creature confrontation reminiscent of Jabberwocky style. Since no separate provided topic is given, and this poem model-written is intended as a Jabberwocky style poem, the topic of creature encounter and slaying is clear. So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond surface action, the poem has implied motifs of caution, bravery, and triumph (admonitions, preparation, battle, return). The final stanza restates caution, cyclical warning motif. Coherent undertone present. So yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.7916666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.7916666666666666, "criteria_yes": 19, "label": "medium"}

There is use of repeated rhyme in multiple stanzas (storm recurs multiple times as end rhyme including in stanza 1 and 6), so possible mild AABB dominance avoided?

The second and fourth lines often rhyme or slant rhyme.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza repeats the opening phrase \"O plane iron camber, brace for the storm\" echoing the first stanza's opening, and repeats \"storm\" multiple times, so ring composition is clearly present with repeated content words and refrain.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>An early admonition or warning to the protagonist is present: \"O plane iron camber, brace for the storm,\" which functions as a cautionary call to prepare for the beast.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation is present: forging shield and binding wing-wires, stoking furnace, awaiting the beast, which shows armament and preparation before the encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter is described: \"At last the zilth-gorge swoops, screech and scream,\" meeting the beast in action.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive slaying action present: \"You brandish steel-cog blade...

So C4 yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Final stanza echoes opening stanza by same warning about \"snarling Glintmoot beast\" and repeating \"Beware\" phrase; heavy content word repetition of \"Beware\", \"snarling\", \"Glintmoot\", \"beast\", and theme of caution; strong ring echo with multiple repeated key words/phrases; meets criteria.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning admonition: Present in first stanza with “Beware the snarling Glintmoot beast” and cautionary phrases; clear admonition.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: Present in stanza 2 with forging blade and making helm, planning to face the beast; clear preparation before encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: Present in stanza 3 describing hunting the Grokling, the named creature; clear meeting between protagonist and adversary.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: Present in stanza 4 where protagonist raises weapon, beast roars, one strike given, and forest quiets; decisive action resolving tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Present in stanza 5 with protagonist returning home, sharing tale, forest’s quiet; and stanza 6 with calm night and echo; no overt celebration phrase but celebratory tone and return evident.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Coinages include “Glintmoot”, “Crankle-fear”, “thorn-bent”, “sable-glint”, “sigil-scarred”, “bracken-twist”, “Badger-knot bloom”, “Grokling”, “clank-filled”, “softening cry” (less clear), “night-born”; at least 8 distinct coined words or compounds not known canonical words; meets threshold.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Every stanza contains at least one coined term (\"Glintmoot beast\" in stanza 1, “thorn-bent”, “sable-glint” in 2nd, “bracken-twist”, “Badger-knot bloom”, “Grokling”, “clank-filled”) including the last stanza “night-born beast”; all stanzas contain coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: Named non-canonical creature \"Grokling\" in stanza 3 central to the action; different from canonical Jabberwock; satisfies criterion.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: No clear onomatopoeic bursts like “snicker-snack”, “pop!”, or “hiss!”;
