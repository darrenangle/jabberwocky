All stanzas are quatrains and count is acceptable.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter echo: Checking line length alternation with at least 2 content-word difference. The pattern is less clear; line lengths seem roughly similar and rhythmic alternation like in Jabberwocky not strongly in evidence. Possibly no strong alternating long/short line pattern in ≥60% stanzas.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme: Rhyme on lines 2 and 4 is consistent in most stanzas (e.g., sway/play, grin/din, dread/land, dire/ire, cry/die, stain/again), showing rhyme and no overuse of couplet (AABB) rhyme scheme. So ≥60% stanzas have (2,4) rhyme and no AABB dominance.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Final stanza repeats phrases or content words from opening? The final stanza echoes \"plumdrown glade,\" \"blueing,\" \"gloamish eve\" mirroring the first stanza's \"plumdrown glade,\" \"blueing bath,\" \"gloamish eve.\" At least two content words (\"plumdrown,\" \"gloamish\") are repeated. This constitutes a ring echo.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning admonition: Present in stanza 2 with \"Beware the Bluingwath,\" a clear admonition to the kin/protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation armament: Present in stanza 3 with taking \"glintshard blade in hand\" and pacing with dread, seeking the beast. This shows protagonist preparation before encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter confrontation: Quite clear in stanza 4 where the Bluingwath is encountered, described, and threat established.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying decisive action: Present in stanza 5 with the raised blade, striking, the squelchy sound, and the beast falling dead. This is the decisive action resolving tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return celebration: The final stanza describes return through the glade and walking in the evening again. No explicit jubilant celebration or acknowledgement, more muted return, so likely no clear celebration.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Coinages identified include \"plumdrown,\" \"blueing,\" \"Bluingwath,\" \"gloamish,\" \"glintshard,\" \"glurking,\" \"plumfire,\" \"squelchy,\" \"ploshy.\" At least 8 distinct invented coinages (some compound but clearly coined). So yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza contains at least one coinage — plumdrown, blueing, gloamish, Bluingwath (stanzas 2 and 4), glintshard, glurking, plumfire, squelchy, ploshy. Each stanza has at least one coined term.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: Non-canonical creature named and central—the \"Bluingwath\" (distinct from Jabberwock), named in stanza 2 and featured throughout.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"Squelchy\" and \"ploshy\" are onomatopoeic bursts describing sounds of the attack. Also \"gush\" could be considered less so. At least two onomatopoeic bursts present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration consonance: Examples include \"plumdrown glade,\" \"blueing bath,\" \"plumfire, wet with ire,\" \"squelchy thud\" and \"ploshy cry\" showing alliteration beyond incidental repeats. More than two stanzas show such alliteration/consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The events occur in canonical order: warning (stanza 2), preparation (3), encounter (4), decisive act (5), return (6). Correct arc order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: No lines are exactly copied from the reference poem after normalization; all lines are distinct and new.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: The poem uses few canonical tokens: only some general function words overlap, no explicit Jabberwocky canonical coinages named or used, so canonical tokens ≤8. Canonical tokens minimal.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer line syllables mostly around 8–9; shorter lines around 5–7. Approximate checking: First stanza 8/7/7/7 (1st line 8 syll); the rest similar. Not perfectly matching Jabberwocky’s ~8/6 but close and consistent in all stanzas. So meets syllable tightness.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhyme endings vary: sway/play, kin/grin, dread/land, mire/ire, flank/die, trod/again. No end rhyme repeated more than twice outside ring echo. Good rhyme variety.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overused above 5 times or 8% of content words outside the refrains. Coinages are varied and balanced.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages show multiple distinct roots: plumdrown, blueing, Bluingwath, gloamish, glintshard, glurking, plumfire, squelchy, ploshy—at least 4 distinct roots and no suffix dominates. Good variety.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Clearly about a Jabberwocky-style poem featuring an invented creature (\"Bluingwath\"), following similar narrative of warning, battle, return—matches the style of the original poem and theme.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Implied motif of confronting fears in a shadowy, eerie environment (\"fears that creep,\" \"twilight’s play,\" “drenches,” “chilling din”). Some undertone of bravery and challenge beyond surface action is present.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.9166666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.9166666666666666, "criteria_yes": 22, "label": "high"}

Thus no.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages invented include: glimmertide, weftly, knotful, spindle-ways, loomkin, whickering, snarlsome, bobbin tree (compound?), woolgaze, clackering, rattled a roar (onomatopoeic? but ‘rattled’ common), fibrous din (common words), snip and slew (common phrases). At least 8 distinct invented coinages exist: glimmertide, weftly, knotful, loomkin, whickering, snarlsome, warpwhirl, woolgaze, stitchery, bobbin tree (some compounds). Clearly ≥8 distinct coinages are present.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza has at least one coinage: e.g., stanza 1 (glimmertide, weftly, knotful, loomkin), stanza 2 (Loomshuttle, picksnatch, Warpwhirl), stanza 3 (whickering, snarlsome, bobbin tree, stitchery), stanza 4 (woolgaze, Loomshuttle, clackering, fibrous din), stanza 5 (whickering, snip, slew), stanza 6 (beast, pick, raveled trick), stanza 7 (glimmertide, weftly, threadbare, spindle-ways, frayed delays). All stanzas contain coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creature (“Loomshuttle”) is non-canonical and central to the poem’s action. Another named creature “Warpwhirl” is mentioned in caution but Loomshuttle is the main adversary.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: “clackering”, “rattled a roar with a fibrous din”, “snip and slew” (snip is somewhat onomatopoeic, “snicker-snack” equivalent), “clackering” and “rattled a roar” are strong onomatopoeic bursts. At least two clear onomatopoeic bursts present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in multiple stanzas: stanza 1 “glimmertide, weftly, wove”, stanza 2 “picksnatch claws, thready grin”, stanza 3 “whickering blade in hand”, stanza 7 “glimmertide, weftly glades” and “frayed delays”. At least two stanzas show clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order matches canonical sequence: warning in stanza 2, preparation in stanza 3, encounter in stanza 4, decisive action in stanza 5, then final ring stanza (suitable for return/celebration). Though final stanza lacks explicit celebration, arc order is preserved.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line matches exactly any canonical line from ‘Jabberwocky’ after normalization. Phrases and coinages differ substantially.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexicon tokens count low: Loomshuttle and Loomkin etc. are new; canonical words such as “the”, “and”, “in”, “his”, “he”, “long”, “he”, “stood”, “came” appear but canonical coinages like vorpal, Jubjub, manxome, etc. do not appear. Canonical tokens ≤8 (possibly only “and”, “he”, “the”, “his”, “long”, “came”, “with” etc.). Meets budget.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts roughly match Jabberwocky meter: longer lines mostly 8–9 syllables, shorter lines 5–7 syllables per quatrain line, consistent across stanzas. Meter is tight.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: end rhymes for lines 2 and 4 vary across stanzas, no overuse of the same exact rhyming word more than twice. Good rhyme variety.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition checked: no single content word overused excessively; “Loomshuttle” repeated a few times as primary noun but no overuse beyond threshold. Distribution of content words shows no problematic repetition.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show variety with at least 4 distinct roots: loom-, glimmer-, spindle-, whicker-, snarlsome, warp-, wool-, stitch-, bobbin-, picksnatch- etc. No suffix dominates >50%. Variety good.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly addresses a battle with a named creature “Loomshuttle”, echoes the structure and style of Jabberwocky without changing topic or substitution. Matches intended topic of a Carroll-style poem about a creature encounter and slaying.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: underlying motif of overcoming a tangled threat, weaving/fabric metaphor pervasive, themes of struggle, preparation, triumph woven into poem.

All stanzas have ≥1 coined or compound invented word.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creature Shiverwraith is non-canonical, central to action and confrontation; meets criterion.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts: \"snarl\", \"snap\", \"crackleclang\", \"zing\", \"zang\" — at least two clear onomatopoeic bursts present (crackleclang, snarl-snap).</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Multiple stanzas show clear alliteration and consonance: stanza 1 \"blue hour’s hush on snow so pale,\", stanza 4 \"crinklecrust\" paired with \"crunch\"/\"crust\", stanza 5 \"snarl and snap of crackleclang\", \"swing\" with \"zang\" and \"zing\", stanza 7 \"Glimmerglint where shadows hide\" (soft alliteration).

No canonical Jabberwocky coinages appear; thus canonical tokens ≤8.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Longer lines mostly 8–9 syllables, shorter mostly 5–7 syllables: e.g., stanza 1 lines alternate roughly (9,7,8,7). Pattern consistent across stanzas with predominant longer/shorter alternation as in Jabberwocky. Meets syllable tightness.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety is good — the rhymes in lines 2 and 4 differ across stanzas with no exact end word reused >2 times, ignoring ring echo words at start/end. E.g. “dale/fail”, “kin/skin”, “gleam/dream”, “gust/thrust”, “outrang/fang”, “won/sun”, “fireside/hide” all different rhymes and words.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No content word is overused excessively; repeated coinages used but balanced; “Shiverwraith” repeated but counted as creature name, used 4 times likely less than 8% overall content words. No other word overly repeated.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show at least 4 distinct roots: glimmer, shiver, frost, crinkle, crackle, zing; suffixes vary; no single coined suffix accounts for >50%. Root variety is strong.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem clearly addresses the topic of a mythical or fantastical creature confrontation, similar in style and theme to \"Jabberwocky\" but with a different creature and setting; topic adherence is clear.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Beyond surface action, there is implied motif of facing and overcoming elemental peril (cold, winter, danger), symbolic of courage and triumph in adversity; coherent undertone detectable through repeated imagery (blue hour, frost, chilling, dawn).
