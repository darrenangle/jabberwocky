Amid the plishy-plash,  \nThe Rattlewhack with bangly flash,  \nCame skittering through the drenchy dash,  \nIts rivet-eyes a steely clash!  \n\nOne, two! I banged with mighty whack,  \nThe pan did clong, the lid did smack,  \nI struck the beast, its frame did crack,  \nAnd silenced was the Rattlewhack.  \n\nAnd hast thou slain the jangly foe?  \nCome, rest by hearth, let stories flow!  \nThe rain still taps a soft hello,  \nAs peace returns to roof aglow.  \n\n'Twas dampish eve, the sky a-gloom,  \nWhen raindrops drummed a dreary tune,  \nYet now no clatter dares resume,  \nThe tin-roofed night sleeps safe from doom.", "info": {}}
