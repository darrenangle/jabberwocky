All stanzas are quatrains.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Check meter alternation: In Jabberwocky, lines alternate ~8 and ~6 syllables. Here, checking most stanzas shows that longer/shorter lines alternate with a significant difference (~2+ content words difference) in at least 5 of 8 stanzas (≥60%). Meter roughly follows alternation pattern.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme pattern: (2,4) lines mostly rhyme or slant rhyme in ≥5 stanzas. There is no dominance of AABB; rhymes vary across stanzas. The poem exhibits ballad-style rhyme (quatrains with 2nd and 4th lines rhyming) in a majority of stanzas.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza repeats opening stanza exactly (except for minor capitalization differences, but content lines identical).

Counting distinct clear coinages (not standard English): stringlit, Postsetter, Fiddlefun, Varnishags, crookly, deftish, sprucey (borderline but likely coined), clipper-clack (onomatopoeic coinage), twanghoo, twanghad. At least 8 distinct coinages definitely present.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Every stanza contains at least one coined or non-canonical word: yes, e.g., stringlit, curvy viols (curvy is English but poetic), plop, Postsetter, crookly, luthier (borderline, but common in music), deftish, sprucey, jiggled, clipper-clack, twanghoo, twanghad.

Though the opening and closing stanza mimic structure and rhyme, wording differs distinctly.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical words usage low and ≤8 distinct canonical tokens: The poem uses very few canonical words from the original list. Only “Beware,” “And,” “Come,” “my,” “and” (all common English stopwords).

Canonical tokens well under 8.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts roughly fit Jabberwocky’s pattern: longer lines ≈8–9 syllables, shorter lines ≈5–7 syllables; this is consistent through the quatrains.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme words vary across stanzas; no end word reused more than twice; ring echo is a repeated stanza but allowed; rhyme variety is maintained.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no single content word is overly repeated; words like “the,” “and,” “he” are common but content words appear with reasonable frequency, none overused across the poem.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: at least 4 distinct roots for coinages (“Post-setter”, “Fiddlefun”, “Varnishags”, “clipper-clack”, “twanghoo”, “stringlit”, “crookly”, “deftish”, “sprucey”) with no single root dominating more than 50%. Suffixes and roots varied.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-style invention themed around “The Postsetter.” The “creature” and the narrative closely mimic Jabberwocky’s arc and theme, not substituting a completely different subject.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem has an implied motif of craftsmanship, skill, and overcoming a crafty obstacle (the Postsetter) in a luthier’s environment.

Multiple stanzas show above-incidental alliteration/consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order is adhered to: warning (stanza 2) → preparation (stanza 3) → encounter (stanza 4) → decisive action (stanza 5) → return/celebration (stanza 6). Ring echo ends the poem. Proper canonical arc order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line verbatim matches from the reference poem when normalized. Words like \"’Twas tarwhiff\" replace \"’Twas brillig\", and rest of lines have different wording or coinages.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens: only \"’Twas\", \"Did\", \"Beware\", \"my son!\", \"he took his\", \"long time\", \"and stood awhile in thought.\" (partial phrases, but mostly paraphrased), \"One, two! One, two!\", \"He left it dead\", \"He went ... back\", \"And hast thou slain\", \"Come to my arms\", \"O ... day\", \"He ... in his joy\", \"’Twas ...\". Canonical tokens count is low, definitely ≤8 core canonical tokens reused; mostly new or paraphrased.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count in each stanza: longer lines generally around 8–9 syllables (\"’Twas tarwhiff, and the crosstie planks\" is 8 syllables, \"Did reek and rumble in the dusk\" is 7, borderline but acceptable), shorter lines 5–7 syllables (\"And the scent beasts did husk\" is 6). Good syllable tightness consistent with Jabberwocky.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety at (2,4) positions: planks/dusk (stanza 1 and repeated stanza 8), son/shun, hand/thought (near rhyme), stood/scream, through/head/back, Creosock/boy (weak slant rhyme), day/Hooray. Most are varied, end word reuse at most twice (planks/dusk repeated only in ring stanza). Variety maintained.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word noticeably overused. Words are varied, and no content word exceeds 5 uses or 8% frequency outside ring echo. Terms like \"Creosock\" appear about 4 times but within limits.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage roots show variety: tarwhiff, creos- (Creosock, creosote), puff- (Puffghast), spoor- (spoorstand), reeks- (reeksome), crack- (crickle-crack), trump- (trumphing), arom- (aromous), guff- (guffled), staunch- (staunchful). At least 6 or more distinct roots with no over-50% suffix dominance.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic is consistent about an invented monstrous \"Creosock\" and a corresponding battle, matching the Jabberwocky's topic as monster hunt and confrontation. Topic adherence clear.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is an implied undertone of environmental toxicity or industrial menace via \"creosote,\" \"reek,\" \"fumes,\" \"blackened wood,\" \"scent beasts,\" \"malodorous despair,\" suggesting an allegory or caution about pollution or industrial impact beyond surface monster fight.
