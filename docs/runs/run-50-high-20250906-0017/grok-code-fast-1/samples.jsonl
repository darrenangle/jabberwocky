Several stanzas are quatrains, but there is one with 4 lines at start (\"Beware... fray\") and last stanza is 4 lines, total 9 stanzas >8; so stanza count out of required 5-8.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Line length alternation: Several stanzas mimic ballad meter with alternating longer and shorter lines (e.g., stanza 4: lines approx 8 and 6 syllables alternating). However, some stanzas have irregular line lengths or all same length (e.g., stanza 1 lines are uneven). At least 6 of 9 stanzas (66%) show alternating length patterns with ≥2 content word difference. Thus meets ≥60% threshold.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme: In stanzas with 4 lines (majority), lines 2 and 4 mostly rhyme or slant rhyme (\"wabe\"/\"sheave\" repeated in ring). Mostly ABXB or ABCB rhyme with second and fourth rhyming or near-rhyming. No dominating AABB pattern visible. Approx 7 of 9 stanzas meet rhyme at lines 2 and 4 ≥60%.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes first stanza's last stanza with repeated content words (’brillig’, ’slithy toves’, ’gyre and gimble’, ’borogoves’, ’Krimple-snipping in the sheave’). This is a clear ring composition with ≥2 repeated content words.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>There is an early admonition: stanza 1 is a warning about the \"Nib(mesh)ling\" with \"Beware\". Also stanza 3 repeats \"Beware\". So clear early admonition present.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>The protagonist prepares: stanza 3 calls to \"Call up thy gridle and thy byte-shield, / And don thy armor\"; stanza 4 also shows \"He took his vorpal net in hand\" and rested under the Tumtum tree. Preparation clearly depicted before encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation is clear: stanza 6 describes the nib(mesh)ling coming \"whiffling through the tulgey wood\"; stanza 7 describes the attack and battle (\"One, two! One, two! …\"). Clear meeting and battle.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action present: stanza 7 \"One, two! One, two! And through and through / The vorpal net went snicker-snack! / He left it dead,\" — decisive slaying action clearly resolves tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: stanza 8 has protagonist’s joyful response (\"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! / He dribbled and gleeful-jubiled the ploy.\"). Return implied, celebration evident.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Coinages such as \"Nib(mesh)ling\", \"dribber\", \"tine-bend\", \"micro-grip\", \"Crook-wet\", \"Krimple-snipping\", \"croc-bite\", \"gridle\", \"byte-shield\", \"bling-blort\", \"garble\", \"turbine-turning\", \"meshly\" — at least 10 distinct invented coinages, exceeding 8.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains ≥1 coinage: stanza 1 - multiple coinages (\"Nib(mesh)ling\", \"dribber\", \"tine-bend\"), stanza 2 canonical words only, stanza 3 coinages (\"croc-bite\", \"gridle\", \"byte-shield\"), stanza 4 canonical with \"vorpal net\" (net is coinage variant?), stanza 6 coinages \"bling-blort\", \"garble\", \"turbine-turning\", \"meshly\", stanza 8 \"frabjous\" canonical but stanza 9 repeats ring stanza. Most stanzas seem to have at least one coinage if counting \"vorpal net\" as coinage or near coinage. However stanza 2 and stanza 9 are canonical or ring repetitions without new coinages. Stanza 5 (\"He took his vorpal net in hand;\") mainly canonical/coined net. Stanza 9 ring repetition. So borderline on stanza 2 and 9. Stanza 2 and 9 lack coinage - so only 7 out of 9 stanzas with coinage, less than 100%, but question requires all stanzas ≥1 coinage which is not met.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creature (\"Nib(mesh)ling\") is introduced and central to action; it is non-canonical and central adversary.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia present: \"snicker-snack\" repeated from canonical poem; \"bling-blort\" and \"dribbled\" less clearly onomatopoeic but \"snicker-snack\" and \"bling-blort\" count as ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration and consonance present: stanza 1 has e.g., \"teeth shine and tine-bend\", \"crook-wet speck\"; stanza 6 \"turbine-turning, meshly good\" shows consonance and alliteration. At least 2 stanzas show clear alliteration beyond incidental repeats.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Admonition (stanza 1 and 3), preparation (3 and 4), encounter (6), decisive act (7), return/celebration (8), and ring/original stanza at end (9). The arc is followed in canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim canonical lines: The ring stanza repeats original lines mostly verbatim (’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves / Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; / All mimsy were the borogoves / The mome raths outgrabe.’). This matches exactly the canonical poem’s lines, failing this criterion.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: canonical tokens appearing are ~8 or fewer: brillig, slithy, toves, gyre, gimble, wabe, mimsy, borogoves, mome, raths, outgrabe, vorpal, manxome, Tumtum, whiffling, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, frabjous, Callooh, Callay. This poem uses canonical words multiple times but most are repeated in the ring stanzas. Number of distinct canonical tokens used is just above 8, likely ~10-12. Therefore, slightly over budget (limit ≤8).</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines mostly ~8–9 syllables; shorter lines mostly ~6 syllables. For example, stanza 4 lines: 8,6,8,6 syllables; stanza 7 also fits pattern. Some minor variations but mostly meets pattern for every quatrain.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme words mostly distinct; the ring stanza repeats \"wabe\" and \"sheave\" as end rhymes, so reused twice excluding ring. No single rhyme word appears more than twice beyond ring. Acceptable rhyme variety.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: Content words beyond the ring stanza do not overuse any single word excessively; no content word exceeds 5 times or 8% frequency.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Multiple coinages are from distinct roots (e.g., nib(mesh)ling, croc-bite, gridle, byte-shield, dribber, tine-bend, krimple-snipping, bling-blort, turbine-turning, meshly), so at least 4 distinct roots identified without majority of coinages from one suffix. Coinage variety sufficient.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a similar topic as Jabberwocky with a named creature, a battle, and returns; no substitution to unrelated topic.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is implied subtext referencing digital/technological imagery (mesh, gridle, byte-shield, turbine-turning), possibly metaphor for a technological foe or challenge layered beyond surface action; thus a coherent undertone and motif is detectable.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.8333333333333334, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 0.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.8333333333333334, "criteria_yes": 20, "label": "high"}

No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes varied with no exact end word reused >2 times excluding ring echo:  \nOnly one stanza rhymes (1st only).

No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word overly repeated ( >5 times or >8%):  \nNo obvious repeated content word overused in the poem; \"Snargle\" used multiple times but <=5; overall lexical variety good.
