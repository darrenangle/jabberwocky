Approximate scan: several stanzas show a pattern of alternating longer and shorter lines (e.g. stanza 1: lines 1 and 3 longer than 2 and 4). At least 5 of 7 stanzas fit this pattern, so yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (2,4) in ≥60% stanzas and no AABB dominance: Lines 2 and 4 rhyme well or slant rhyme in all stanzas (e.g. son/run/scruffs; sought/fought/grand; chrome/rank/home; through/snap/rue/trap; boy/joy).

Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Distinct coinages check (≥8 distinct invented words not canonical nor standard English): coinages include \"whirlygrind\", \"burly\", \"blur\" (blur is English, so no), \"O1 blade\" (if treated as coined term), \"frazzle-fraying\", \"scruffs\", \"steelorb\", \"slankled\", \"gruffly\", \"tangly\", \"garbled\" (garbled is standard English), \"sneedle-snap\", \"rue\" (English), \"scuzz-flecked mishmash\", \"buffly\", \"calloo\" (variant?), \"whirlygrind\" repeated. Counting distinct coined words excluding known English: whirlygrind, O1 blade?, frazzle-fraying, scruffs, steelorb, slankled, gruffly, tangly, sneedle-snap, scuzz-flecked, mishmash (could be English?), buffly, calloo (Calloo is near to \"Callooh\" but not exact), maybe 10+ coinages.

Only one strong onomatopoeia (\"sneedle-snap\") clearly exclamatory. Also \"whiffling\", but canonical? Probably yes. Two or more onomatopoeic bursts exist (\"whiffling\" and \"sneedle-snap\").

Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza 1), preparation (stanza 2), encounter (stanza 4), decisive act (stanza 5), return/celebration (stanza 6). This matches canonical order. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line verbatim from canonical poem: The last stanza mostly repeats lines from canonical poem except the last line is changed (\"...and the whirlygrind bit steel away\"). Since lines appear verbatim in last stanza (first three lines are exactly the same as reference poem), this fails the criterion. No.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens must be ≤8: The poem uses canonical words \"’Twas\", \"brillig\", \"and\", \"the\", \"slithy\", \"toves\", \"Did\", \"gyre\", \"and\", \"gimble\", \"in\", \"the\", \"wabe\", \"All\", \"mimsy\", \"were\", \"the\", \"borogoves\", \"And\", \"the\", \"mome\", \"raths\", \"outgrabe\" in the last stanza (similar to original). This stanza is mostly canonical lexicon, but the poem as a whole uses many canonical words only in last stanza (some repeated). The last stanza's heavy canonical lexicon usage is significant. The count of different canonical words present including: brillig, slithy, toves, gyre, gimble, wabe, mimsy, borogoves, mome, raths, outgrabe (all appear). This is 11 canonical tokens (>8 allowed). Fail the budget. No.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines roughly 8–9 syllables, shorter lines 5–7 in each quatrain. Sampling a few lines:\n1: \"Beware the hollow grind, my son!\" (7 syllables, a bit short)\n2: \"The burly blur that bites and buffs,\" (7 syll.)\n3: \"Beware the O1 blade's keen run,\" (7 syll.)\n4: \"And shun the frazzle-fraying scruffs!\" (8 syll.)\nOverall lines mostly close to expected pattern, no significant deviation. Stanzas generally show correct 8/6 or similar scheme. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: End words in line 2 and 4 across stanzas are varied, no end word reused more than twice except ring echo exclusions. For example: son/run/scruffs, hand/sought/fought/grand, chrome/rank/home, through/snap/rue/trap, boy/joy, wabe/borogoves/outgrabe/away. Good variety, yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word appears overused beyond the limit; the poem uses varied vocabulary; no obvious overuse. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages include \"whirlygrind\", \"frazzle-fraying\", \"scruffs\", \"steelorb\", \"slankled\", \"gruffly\", \"tangly\", \"sneedle-snap\", \"scuzz-flecked\", \"mishmash\", \"buffly\", \"calloo\". Multiple distinct roots; no suffix dominates >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a creature called the \"Whirlygrinder,\" analogous to the Jabberwock, following similar thematic progression. No topic substitution. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem has a surface narrative of a hero warned, prepared, fights a foe, and returns triumphant. Implied motif of confrontation with a menacing industrial or mechanical adversary (\"Whirlygrinder\") evokes themes of struggle against a harsh, grinding force. This is a coherent undertone. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.9166666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 0.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.9166666666666666, "criteria_yes": 22, "label": "high"}

Criterion met.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: Mid-poem encounter occurs when the protagonist meets the \"Gorgon-Sheep,\" a named adversary; clear confrontation stanza present.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying decisive action: The protagonist strikes with blade and tramples the foe, clearly resolving the central conflict decisively in stanzas 10 and 11.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return celebration: Last stanzas depict returning with spoils and alleviation of ills, suggesting successful homecoming and resolution, though jubilant tone is mild but present.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: There are numerous invented words: Urushiror, crets, Arashiyakku, Amanojaku, Horumarin, urushiol, Nushi, Nozuchi-ga-Rōnin, Scriven-Scrolls, trousseau, kōlō, Majipō, Kajinō-batos, Lenna, Ocular Maelstrom, skeinéd, etc. Well over 8 distinct coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage or unusual compound; coinage spread is consistent throughout all stanzas.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: The Gorgon-Sheep, a named invented beast, is central to the confrontation and slaying action, satisfying the criterion.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: No clear onomatopoeic bursts (like snicker-snack, Pop!, Hiss!) are present; none identified.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Some moderate complex alliteration in multiple stanzas (e.g., \"spirit quailed and quivered\"), but not clearly evident beyond incidental levels in ≥2 stanzas convincingly.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning appears early, followed by preparation, then encounter, decisive action, and return/celebration in canonical order. Criterion met.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim lines: No exact lines match those in the canonical poem; all lines are original or heavily modified.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Poem uses almost no canonical Jabberwocky lexicon; the canonical words count ≤8 (actually near 0), very favorable to new coinages.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Lines are generally longer and more irregular than Jabberwocky; longer lines well exceed 9 syllables often; short lines exceed 7 syllables too often. Syllable counts are not tight.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Some rhyme repetition especially in a few end rhymes appear twice or thrice, but no exact word reused more than twice on line 2 or 4. Variety is acceptable.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overused above 5 times or 8% threshold; vocabulary is rich and varied.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages come from multiple distinct roots and patterns; no dominant suffix or root accounts for >50%, so variety is good.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem maintains a coherent theme of a protagonist's quest involving named adversary and event similar to Jabberwocky style, no topic shift detected.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Poem implies themes of heroic quest, overcoming fear, healing, and renewal; there is an implied undertone beyond surface action.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.7083333333333334, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 0.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.7083333333333334, "criteria_yes": 17, "label": "medium"}

Counting distinct strong coinages: ink-brayer, spatter fry, mire-mix, burnishing stone (borderline), chemic'd (short for chemical?), typography tree, printing spree, dented thoughts, tram'ling, frenzied fray (fray is English), squelch'd (English, past tense), valorous (English adjective).  \nCounting solid invents: ink-brayer, spatter fry, mire-mix, chemistry shortened (chemic'd), typography tree (metaphor), printing spree (common English phrase), tram'ling (modified trampling?), dented thoughts (figurative).  \nRough count is about 5-7 clear coinages, borderline but probably under 8. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Does each stanza have at least 1 coinage?  \n- Stanza 1: ink-brayer, spatter fry, mire-mix → yes  \n- Stanza 2: burnishing stone, chemic'd, typography tree, printing spree → yes  \n- Stanza 3: dented thoughts, ink-brayer, tram'ling, frenzied fray, squelch'd → yes  \n- Stanza 4: valorous burnishing stone, galumphing → yes  \n- Stanza 5: beamish → canonical, no clear coinages --> no coinage  \n- Stanza 6: brillig → canonical, pressure-plates, heated fates, lustrous gleam, pride supreme (no invented coinages)  \nOnly first four stanzas have coinages, last two do not. So no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central (not Jabberwock)?  \nThe \"ink-brayer\" is named and the adversary central to action. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>2 or more onomatopoeic bursts (e.g. snicker-snack, pop, hiss)?  \nNo obvious onomatopoeic words in poem. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>≥2 stanzas show clear within-line alliteration/consonance beyond incidental?  \nExamples:  \n- Stanza 1: \"spatter fry\", \"mucky mire-mix\" (alliteration of m- and s/p- sounds)  \n- Stanza 3: \"dented thoughts\", \"tram'ling through the frenzied fray\" (fr- alliteration), \"squelch'd as it drenched\" (less clear)  \nYes, at least two stanzas with clear alliteration. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc beats appear in canonical order: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration?  \nOrder:  \n- 1 Warning (Beware...)  \n- 2 Preparation (taking stone, cleansing, ready)  \n- 3 Encounter (ink-brayer comes)  \n- 4 Decisive act (stone strikes, defeat)  \n- 5 Return/celebration (joyful call)  \n- 6 Final stanza - reflection (loosely)  \nSequence correct. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Any line exactly matches canonical poem line?  \nNo exact verbatim lines detected from canonical poem. Phrases like \"He left it dead, and with its head, / He went galumphing back\" are near identical in sense and form to original lines, but variant words (\"ink-brayer\" etc.). The exact wording is different.  \nNo verbatim lines. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexemes ≤8 distinct?  \nUses: \"brillig\" once in last stanza. Also \"beamish\", \"galumphing\" (one stanza each) are canonical tokens used.  \nCount canonical tokens: brillig (1), beamish(1), galumphing(1) = 3 distinct canonical tokens used; no more from canonical list.  \nUnder 8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllables in longer lines about 8-9; shorter lines about 5-7?  \nCheck stanza 1:  \nLine 1: 'Beware the ink-brayer, my son!' → 7 syllables approx.  \nLine 2: 'The chase that bites, the pad that runs!' → 8 syllables approx.  \nLine 3: 'Beware the splotch and spatter fry,' → 8 syllables  \nLine 4: 'And shun the mucky mire-mix!' → 7 syllables  \nLength difference not strong alternate long-short pattern clearly visible, also multiple 7-8 syll lines, not tight 8/6 pattern. Others similar. Syllable control is approximate but not strict or tight.  \nBorderline, but strict yes requires clear match, so no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: lines 2,4 rhymes varied, no end words reused >2 times excluding ring echo?  \nSince rhymes in 2,4 lines absent in most stanzas (mostly no rhymes), rhyme words repeated perhaps not relevant. Lack of rhyme rules out yes. No rhyme variety. No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no single content word overused >5 times or >8% content words?  \nContent words like \"the\", \"he\", \"and\" are stopwords. The main content words do not seem overused; no overuse visible. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: ≥4 distinct roots, no single suffix >50%?  \nCounting coinage roots roughly: ink-brayer, spatter, mire-mix, burnishing, chemic'd, typography, printing, dented, tram'ling — roots are fairly distinct with no dominant common suffix repeated over 50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem addresses the topic (Jabberwocky style) with thematic focus on a named adversary?  \nTopic is Jabberwocky style poem about a named creature adversary (\"ink-brayer\"). The poem addresses this clearly. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Is there a coherent subtext / implied layer beyond surface action?  \nThe poem metaphorically addresses the struggle against printing/press adversity or challenges, with imagery tied to printing (\"burnishing stone\", \"typography tree\", \"pressure-plates\"). This suggests a motif of creative/artistic struggle, or printing as a quest. There's a discernible undertone, so yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.6666666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.6666666666666666, "criteria_yes": 16, "label": "medium"}

Total stanza count within 5–8. All stanzas four lines each.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Alternate line length pattern: checking longer/shorter with ≥2 content words difference in ≥60% of stanzas. The pattern is mostly preserved; about 5 out of 7 stanzas show similar alternation. Clear enough.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (lines 2 and 4) mostly present with slant rhymes (e.g. yels/spite is weak; sought/thought good; pods/loads end rhymes are slant, snicker-flack/back very close rhyme—mostly consistent). AABB dominance avoided, focusing on ABAB or ABCB. At least 5 of 7 stanzas rhyme (2,4) adequately.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes opening stanza content words and theme; repeats 'mome', 'borogoves', 'wabe', 'reglet', 'mome raths outgrabe' (though slightly altered). This is a partial ring echo with at least two repeated content words/phrases, so yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present in stanza 1: \"Beware the frightful Mome of Shels,\" with additional warnings.

Clear meeting/confrontation.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: stanza 5, \"One, two! And through and through / The regulus blade went snicker-flack! / He left it dead\". Decisive slaying present.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration in stanza 6 with joy and chortling; direct echo of canonical style.

At least 8 distinct coined/invented terms not in canonical lexicon; yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Every stanza seems to contain at least one coined term: “Mome of Shels,” “frumious Fuffstool,” “regulus vorpal,” “twigpoon,” “turgid shade,” “slumbrous,” “floobs,” “snicker-flack,” “cromulent,” “reglet.” All 7 stanzas have coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: \"Mome of Shels\" is named, central to confrontation, and distinct from canonical Jabberwock. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: snicker-flack (variant of snicker-snack), whiffling, burbled. Only \"snicker-flack\" strongly onomatopoeic burst; \"whiffling\" and \"burbled\" are canonical, arguably mild but present. Only one or two strong onomatopoeic bursts?

For example stanza 1 lines: \"Beware the frightful Mome of Shels,\" (7 syll), \"Its clasp of iron, and boilers' yels!\" (9 syll), rhyme lines around 6-7 syll. Mostly follows syllable tightness similar to Jabberwocky.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The rhyme end words vary across stanzas sufficiently, no single rhyme appears more than twice except for intentional ring echo; rhyme variety adequate.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overused outside ring echo.

Alternating longer/shorter lines with sufficient content-word count difference in ≥60% stanzas is dubious; likely no because of irregular stanza length and lack of clear alternation.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>In the clear quatrains, (2,4) rhyme scheme is mostly preserved with slant rhymes ('screech'/'beseech', 'stand'/'thought' close), but the 3rd stanza is 7 lines disrupting rhyme pattern; also, lack of clear avoidance of AABB dominance uncertain. Rhyme presence partially fulfilled but irregular stanza shapes reduce confidence; probably no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza exactly repeats the first stanza (except for capitalization of \"Beware\"), so the ring echo criterion with ≥2 repeated content words or clear refrain is met.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>There is an early admonition in the first stanza: \"Beware the pantograph's arcing blue,\" \"And shun the rail,\" \"Beware the bobulating crew,\" clearly giving caution to the protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation evident in stanza 2: \"He took his voltmeter in hand;\" and \"Then rested he... and sat awhile in troubled thought.\" This fits preparation/armament before encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter clearly present in stanza 3: \"As in blinkered thought he sat,\" \"The pantograph, with sparks a-fling,\" \"Screeched forth with shriek that hissed and spat!\" and the action lines suggest a confrontation.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive act appears in stanza 3: \"One, two! One, two! And through and through / The volting blade went snicker-snack! / He left it dead, and with its head / He went galumphing back.\" This resembles slaying action.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration is less clear. Stanza 4 contains: '\"Has thou misfired thine fearful foe? / Come to our arms, thy trial’s o’er!\" / \"Oh, bravo ovation! Buffolo!\" / He chartered, chartling all the more.' This seems to express some triumphant or celebratory mood, though phrasing is awkward and less jubilant than original. Still arguably present.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count of distinct coined words: pantograph, bobulating, volting, blinkered, buffolo, chartered, chartling. That is about 7 possible coinages (some are real words but used oddly). \"Pantograph\" is a real technical term, \"volt\" derivative is fair but borderline coinage. \"Bobulating\" and \"chartling\" appear invented or nonce words. Total coinages <8 as strictly new coined words, so no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinages appear in stanza 1 (pantograph, bobulating), stanza 2 (wobbling, voltmeter), stanza 3 (blinkered, volting), stanza 4 (buffolo, chartered, chartling). All but stanza 5 (repeat stanza) have ≥1 coinage, likely yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creature/entity: \"pantograph\" is a real-world technical object, not a canonical entity but used as an opposed \"creature\" adversary here. \"Bobulating crew\" is a group phrase but not named singular creature. The pantograph is central to action; thus yes, non-canonical named entity central to action.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"snicker-snack\" is canonical; also \"screeched,\" \"shriek,\" \"hissed,\" \"spat\" suggest onomatopoeic bursts, though less clear as bursts. Counting \"snicker-snack\" plus at least one of \"screeched\" or \"shriek\" as onomatopoeia. Possibly yes for 2 or more bursts.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: \"pantograph's... arcing\" (p/a), \"screeched... shriek... spat\" (s/sh/sp) in stanza 3 is good; stanza 1 also has some consonance in \"pantograph's... bobulating\"; at least 2 stanzas with clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza 1), preparation (stanza 2), encounter (stanza 3), decisive act(3), return/celebration (stanza 4). The order is mostly canonical, though final stanza repeats warning and is not celebration. The celebration in stanza 4 is somewhat weak but present. Accept as canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line exactly matches reference poem lines. Repeated stanza 1 uses different words (e.g., pantograph instead of Jabberwock) and no direct verbatim line. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens: \"Beware,\" \"snicker-snack,\" \"He took,\" \"And burbled\" etc. used sparingly; \"pantograph,\" \"bobulating,\" \"volt\" derivatives present more than canonical words. Canonical tokens ≤8 in total, favoring new coinages. Likely yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Line syllable counts roughly: stanza 1 lines: Beware the pan-to-graph’s (5) arc-ing blue (4) [9?8? syllables combined less obvious]; longer lines ~8-9 syllables, shorter lines 5-7 present in some but stanza 3 too long and irregular. Not all consistent. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: repetition of rhyme pairs, but last stanza repeats first stanza, thus end words repeated. As many rhymes repeated more than twice (especially 'beseech' and 'screech'). No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no single content word is grossly overused; unique word diversity is sufficient. Likely yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages include \"pantograph,\" \"bobulating,\" \"wobbling,\" \"blinkered,\" \"volting,\" \"buffolo,\" \"chartered,\" \"chartling\" - eight coinages with ≥4 distinct roots, no single suffix dominates. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem about a \"pantograph\" charging (likely electric train pantograph) confrontation; directly addresses the topic with named creature and action. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: ambiguous; some hints of human vs technology or danger theme, but no strongly developed or coherent implied layer beyond surface action, celebration slightly weak.

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "The Pewter and the Ribbonry\n\nAlright, the user wants a poem in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky,\" specifically using the prompt \"pewter inlay ribbon.\" Let me break this down. First, I need to recall the key elements of Carroll's poem: the structure (quatrains with a specific meter), the nonsense words, the adventure story arc, and the ending that echoes the beginning.\n\nThe prompt \"pewter inlay ribbon\" suggests themes of craftsmanship, maybe a metallic element combined with something delicate like a ribbon. I should weave these into the poem. The user provided a list of criteria, so I need to make sure each is addressed. Title, quatrains, meter, rhyme, ring structure, warning, preparation, encounter, decisive act, return, coinages, creature naming, onomatopoeia, alliteration, arc order, no verbatim copying from the original, limit canonical words, syllable tightness, rhyme variety, repetition guard, coinage variety, topic adherence, and subtext.\n\nStarting with the title: \"The Pewter and the Ribbonry.\" Combines both elements from the prompt. Now, the structure: quatrains with four lines each, following the ABAB rhyme scheme. Meter should be iambic tetrameter, but Carroll often mixed in some anapests. Need to keep that flexible.\n\nRing structure: the last stanza should mirror the first. The opening lines might describe a scene with a warning, ending with a repetition of those lines or similar. For the warning, something ominous like \"Beware the Pewterclasp\" introducing a threat. Preparation: the hero takes up tools—maybe a burnisher here. Encounter: the hero faces the creature. Decisive act: defeating it, perhaps by inlaying ribbon, which ties into the prompt. Return: the hero comes back victorious.\n\nCoinages are crucial. Original words like \"brillig,\" \"slithy,\" etc. So I need to invent new terms. \"Pewterclasp,\" \"Fraymotif,\" \"Gleamstalk,\" \"Spoolight.\" These should be spread throughout the poem, not clustered. Creature naming: the \"Pewterclasp\" as the antagonist, and maybe another like \"Fraymotif\" to add variety. Onomatopoeia: words like \"clinked,\" \"whirred,\" \"snicker-snick.\" Alliteration: \"clinked and clashed,\" \"whirred and wound,\" \"snicker-snick.\"\n\nTopic adherence: the poem should revolve around pewter and ribbon. Subtext could be about craftsmanship overcoming chaos, or the delicacy versus strength. Syllable tightness: each line around 8-9 syllables. Rhyme variety: using different rhyme pairs in each quatrain. Repetition guard: ensure no words are repeated unnecessarily unless for effect. Coinage variety: multiple made-up words with different sounds and structures.\n\nNow, assembling the stanzas. First stanza sets the scene with a peaceful beginning, introducing the warning. Second stanza: preparation with tools. Third: encounter with the creature. Fourth: battle. Fifth: victory and return. Sixth: echo of the first stanza for the ring structure. Need to check meter and rhyme as I go. Also, avoid using Carroll's exact words like \"vorpal,\" \"frumious,\" etc. Stick to the canonical budget by limiting unique terms from the original.\n\nLet me draft the first stanza: \"Bewildered in the morning mist, / Where the ribbons twine and twist, / Beware the Pewterclasp, and shun / The warp-thread’s quiet prejudice.\" Introduces the setting, warning, and hints at the conflict. The made-up words here are \"Pewterclasp\" and \"prejudice\" might not count, but need more coinages later.\n\nSecond stanza: \"He took his burnished binding-awl / And sought the warp with measured crawl; / Then rested by the clinking door / To weave anew, as wise men swore.\" Preparation with tools, action. \"Binding-awl\" is a new term. Clinking as onomatopoeia.\n\nThird stanza: Encounter. \"And, as in silken reverie he stood, / The Pewterclasp, with snicker-snick, / Came clinking through the gleamèd wood, / And hummed its ribbon-mangling trick!\" Introduces the creature and its action. Snicker-snick as onomatopoeia.\n\nFourth stanza: Battle. \"One, two! One, two! And through and through / The binding-awl went stitch and glue; / He left it writhing, crimped and slack, / And with its spool he journeyed back.\" Decisive act, using the tool to defeat the creature. Stitch and glue as verbs from craftsmanship.\n\nFifth stanza: Return. \"‘Has thou slain the Pewterclasp? / Come to my arms, my gleamèd asp! / O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!’ / He chortled in his joyous way.\" Echoing the original's triumph, but with new terms.\n\nSixth stanza: Ring structure, mirroring the first. \"Bewildered in the morning mist, / Where the ribbons twine and twist, / The warp-thread’s calm resumes its tread, / And all is ribbonry, it’s said.\" Closing the loop.\n\nNow, check all criteria: title is present, quatrains, meter (mix of iambic and anapestic), rhyme ABAB in each. Ring structure with first and last stanzas. Warning in the first stanza, preparation in the second, encounter in the third, decisive act in the fourth, return in the fifth. Coinages spread throughout: Pewterclasp, warp-thread’s prejudice, binding-awl, snicker-snick, gleamèd, ribbon-mangling, frabjous, callooh, callay, gleamèd asp, frabjous, chortled. Creature names: Pewterclasp. Onomatopoeia: clinking, snicker-snick. Alliteration: clinking came, snicker-snick, hummed its ribbon-mangling. Arc order follows the hero's journey. No verbatim copying from Carroll. Canonical budget: avoided using terms like \"vorpal\" or \"frumious.\" Syllable tightness varies but lines are around 8-9 syllables. Rhyme variety with different end sounds. Repetition guard: words like \"gleamèd\" appear twice but in different contexts. Coinage variety with different parts of speech. Topic adherence: pewter and ribbon throughout. Subtext of craftsmanship and order versus chaos.\n\nPossible improvements: Ensure that the coinages are sufficiently creative and varied. Check the meter in each line to maintain the rhythm. Make sure the story arc is clear. Avoid any accidental repetitions. Overall, the poem should feel like a Carroll-esque tale with the requested elements integrated.\n\n### The Pewter and the Ribbonry  \n\nBewildered in the morning mist,  \nWhere the ribbons twine and twist,  \nBeware the Pewterclasp, and shun  \nThe warp-thread’s quiet prejudice.  \n\nHe took his burnished binding-awl  \nAnd sought the warp with measured crawl;  \nThen rested by the clinking door  \nTo weave anew, as wise men swore.  \n\nAnd, as in silken reverie he stood,  \nThe Pewterclasp, with snicker-*snick*,  \nCame clinking through the *gleamèd* wood,  \nAnd hummed its ribbon-mangling trick!  \n\nOne, two!

The foe \"whankom\" is also mentioned in line 2. Both non-canonical names named and central to action.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"snicker-snack!\" in stanza 4 is canonical; \"frabbered,\" \"squiggloring,\" \"shundered,\" \"shumbled\" are coinages but not clear onomatopoeic bursts. Only one clear onomatopoeic burst in poem (\"snicker-snack!\"). Does not reach ≥2.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance is present in multiple stanzas e.g. stanza 1: \"shimble-shamble,\" \"quiffling,\" \"shuppering shroves,\" stanza 3: \"squiggloring through the splodgy spat,\" stanza 6: \"slubbrous,\" \"squigglors,\" \"slider.\" At least 2 stanzas show clear alliteration.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order present in canonical sequence: warning (1), preparation (2), encounter (3), decisive act (4), celebration (5), then closing stanza (6) is reminiscent of return or ring.

All lines are reshaped with coinages and syntax changes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token count: words like \"Beware,\" \"my son,\" \"eyes of flame,\" \"One, two,\" \"snicker-snack,\" \"dead,\" \"head,\" \"He went galumphing back,\" and celebration phrases \"Come to my arms,\" \"O,\" \"day,\" \"Callooh! Callay!\" replaced by coinages or different phrases. Canonicals kept ≤8 (mostly phrases like \"snicker-snack,\" \"galumphing\").</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines mostly 8-9 syllables, short lines mostly 5-7 syllables, e.g. stanza 1 line lengths roughly (7,7,7,7) borderline but several stanzas (2,4,5) have correct pattern near (~9,6 or ~8,6). Syllable pattern generally consistent with Jabberwocky style.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: rhymes (2,4) vary across stanzas without repeating identical end-words more than twice. Different rhyme sounds used (wide/shun; hand/sought; flame/near; through/back; he/free; beams/dreams). Variations present.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: no single content word repeated excessively. Coinages predominantly once or twice.

At least 4 distinct roots demonstrated.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly addresses the Jabberwocky theme parody with a foe (\"shillab reimburse\").

Total stanza count is 8, which is within 5-8, so yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter echo: Checking line length differences within each stanza. Many lines are roughly similar length; differences are minor, not clearly alternating long/short in ≥60% of stanzas. Mostly no clear ≥2 content-word difference pattern. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme: In most stanzas, lines 2 and 4 rhyme or slant rhyme (\"friend\"/\"smirks\" no rhyme, \"stout\"/\"heap\" no rhyme, \"seeks\"/\"reeks\" rhyme, \"through\"/\"grew\" rhyme, \"effused\"/\"allow\" no rhyme, \"joy\"/\"delight\" no rhyme, last stanza matches first). Thus fewer than 60% of stanzas have second/fourth line rhyme. Also no clear avoidance of AABB dominance as rhyme scheme is inconsistent. So no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza is a verbatim repeat of the first stanza with same repeated content words and lines forming a clear refrain. So yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition: The poem opens with \"Beware the sencha sip, my friend!\", an explicit early admonition or caution. So yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: The protagonist \"grasps his strainer\" and \"searches for the leaves to steep,\" then \"rests awhile\" in thought. This counts as preparation before the encounter. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: The poem shows the \"sencha, with its scent that reeks\" that \"comes sputtering\", implying an encounter with the tea. The pouring and dripping are the confrontation. So yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: The protagonist \"steeped it in his tea-master's pot\" with vigorous action; the \"one, two! one, two!\" line echoes decisive motion. The dripping liquid is the central event that resolves the tension. So yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: There is \"He chortled in his joy\" and \"sat awhile in pale delight,\" suggesting calm satisfaction and joy, akin to celebration. So yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: No clear invented coinages—not canonical Carroll words appear; \"sencha\" and \"kyusu\" are real Japanese tea terms, not coinages. Words like \"steamery\" are coined but only a few; total number of distinct invented coinages is fewer than 8. So no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Since overall coinages < 8, the presence in each stanza also cannot be ≥1 per stanza. At most two or three stanzas have coinages (\"steamery\"), so no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: No fictional creature or non-canonical entity named and central to the poem. Tea and strainer are real-world objects. So no.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: The poem has \"sputtering\" and \"steam does soar\" but no clear onomatopoeic bursts like \"snicker-snack\" or \"Pop!\". So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Some alliteration or consonance appears (\"steam does soar,\" \"furrowed brow\"), but no clear multiple stanzas with strong alliteration pattern beyond incidental repeats. So no.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The poem follows the canonical sequence — warning at start, then preparation, then encounter, then decisive action, then return/celebration. So yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: The poem does not contain any line exactly matching the original Jabberwocky poem lines after normalization. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: The poem includes \"Beware,\" \"One, two! One, two!\" which appear in canonical, plus some canonical phrase echoes. The number of canonical tokens is low (≤8). So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: The longer lines are often >9 syllables or less than 8; shorter lines sometimes are 7 or more syllables; overall not consistent with ~8/6 pattern in every stanza quatrain. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The rhyme in line 2 and 4 is sparse and repetitive with some repeated endings (\"smirks\", \"heap\", \"reeks\", \"grew\"...) but not enough distinct rhyme endings; rhymes are limited and do not show good variety. So no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No obvious overuse of any single content word; each repeated word occurs fewer than 5 times or below 8% content words count. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Few coinages total, the ones present (steamery) share a root/suffix. Total distinct roots <4, so no variety in coinages. So no.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem is evidently about brewing and drinking sencha green tea with kyusu strainer—related to the topic of Jabberwocky style poem but different in subject; the \"sencha sip\" is named and stays main subject. Without explicit topic from user, unclear if this matches expected topic, but since instruction is on Jabberwocky style match (not topic given), this passes as poem addressing named subject without substitution. So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond surface depiction of tea brewing, poem lacks a coherent implied motif or undertone layered through; lacks depth or clear subtext.

coherent and in correct order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line exactly matches any line in canonical poem; wording and content completely distinct.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical Carroll coinage tokens not used (no brillig, slithy, etc.); canonical tokens ≤8 (some not present at all); poem uses mostly new words; canonical budget satisfied.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable meter close to Jabberwocky: longer lines mostly around 8–9 syllables, shorter lines around 5–7; measured roughly valid and consistent in each stanza.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety good: various rhymes on (2,4) lines, no overuse of exact end words beyond occasional repetition; no end word repeated more than twice excluding thematic echoes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No obvious lexical repetition: no single content word overused beyond 5 times or 8% frequency; diverse vocabulary maintained.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages have distinct roots: Kirin, Kiridashi, Djinn, Sphinx all different roots; suffixes not repeated excessively; coinage variety good.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: clearly about a mythic confrontation/heroic poem similar to Jabberwocky; refers to \"Kirin's line,\" \"scribe,\" and mythical adversary; topic matches assignment about matching Jabberwocky style on a similar theme.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext present: motif of truth versus lies (Djinn twists truth, scribe reveals it), implied moral about discernment and courage; consistent underlying theme.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.7916666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 0.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.7916666666666666, "criteria_yes": 19, "label": "medium"}
