However, stanza count exceeds the allowed maximum of 8; requirement is 5-8 stanzas. So fails stanza count requirement.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Examine meter pattern: Jabberwocky uses alternating longer (≈8-9 syll.) and shorter (≈5-7 syll.) lines in quatrains, resembling ballad meter stress pattern with >2 content word difference per line pair. Here, syllable counts fluctuate but not strongly consistently alternating, and content word count differences uncertain; less than 60% stanzas clearly exhibit this alternating pattern. Lines often roughly similar length. So no strong or consistent ballad meter echo.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Check rhyme pattern: Majority stanzas rhyme in lines (2,4) or slant rhyme, but some inconsistency. Some stanzas appear to repeat end rhymes in AABB pattern (stronger than Jabberwocky’s usual ABAB or ABCB). Rhyme sometimes forced or imperfect; not fully avoiding AABB dominance as requested. Also some stanzas have weak rhyme. Overall, less than 60% stanzas clearly meet rhyme pattern requirement.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Does final stanza echo opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words / phrase or clear refrain? Final stanza is new and different in wording; no repetition of earlier stanza lines or phrases beyond standard canon tokens. So no ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Is there an early admonition/warning? An early stanza with \"Bevor! Beware the grindblade’s shriek,\" containing a direct warning to the protagonist, fits admonition criterion clearly. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Does the protagonist prepare? Yes, stanza three shows the hero taking flibber (a tool), whetting it keen, seeking the foe—clear preparation before confrontation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Is there a clear encounter between protagonist and adversary? Yes, the \"grindblade\" is described taking a threatening stance and lines describe confrontation and challenge. Meets encounter stage.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Is there a decisive act resolving the tension? Yes, stanza 10 depicts the hero slaying the \"snipe\" with \"sward in hand\" and \"Did slay the snipe in gallantry!\" Decisive killing action present.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Is there an explicit return and celebration? Yes, stanza 11 and 12 have triumphant and celebratory lines about strode triumphant, chortling with joy, blade now sheened, and remembrance—a celebratory return scene.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented coinages: skeel, slym, giggnd, thridsman, hym, zizzing, bevor, grindblade, glink, hew, flinty, tweak, snope, wally, bewhisk, grundleshroud, gusty, snaggled, grepish, issed, snipe, glisted, droned, grithed, grubled, snort, hiss, sneak, sheened, smoothed, aright, sheath, etc. Clearly more than 8 unique coined terms beyond canon tokens. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Does each stanza contain at least one coinage? Many stanzas have multiple coinages; some stanzas have some lexical overlap with non-coinage words, but overall every stanza contains at least one coined word or phrase. Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Is a non-canonical creature/entity named and central? Yes, \"grindblade\" is a named adversary creature/object, central to the poem’s action and conflict (not the Jabberwock). Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Are there ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts? Onomatopoeia such as \"snort,\" \"hiss,\" \"droned,\" \"issed\" (?). Only \"snort\" and \"hiss\" suggest onomatopoeia clearly. \"Gliggnd\" and \"zizzing\" somewhat onomatopoeic as well. Two clear onomatopoeic bursts present. Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Is alliteration and consonance present strongly in at least two stanzas? Multiple stanzas contain strong alliteration, e.g. \"snope talons flash,\" \"grithed and grubled,\" \"whetted keen,\" \"gusty and lean,\" and \"flang splinters free.\" Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Does the poem’s arc follow canonical order (warning → prep → encounter → decisive → return)? Yes, warning stanza 2, prep stanza 3, encounter stanza 4-7, decisive stanza 10, return stanza 11-12; proper sequential narrative flow. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim lines from canonical poem? No line exactly matches canonical lines even allowing for normalized quotes or spacing. No.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens ≤8 favoring coinage? Canonical tokens used appear limited to a few words: \"Beware,\" \"beamish,\" \"O,\" \"Callooh! Callay!,\" \"Come to my arms,\" \"my son/boy,\" \"One, two! One, two!\" plus possibly 'And' and 'He.' Under or about 8 tokens. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Are longer lines ~8-9 syllables, shorter lines ~5-7 syllables? Lines loosely approximate this but many variances; some longer lines exceed 9 syllables and some shorter lines are longer than 7 syllables. Not consistently tight. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety across stanzas: (2,4) end rhymes varied without excessive repeats? Some rhymes repeated (e.g. \"sheer\" and \"clear,\" \"hiss\" and \"bliss\") but not excessively repeated more than twice. Some rhyme reuse but not dominant. Passes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No word overused heavily, no suspicious overuse outside ring echo. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages include many distinct roots (grind-, slym-, glin-, snope-, grundle-, grep-, snip-, grub- etc.); no single suffix over 50%. Varied. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly is a pastiche of Jabberwocky but with a different adversary, \"grindblade,\" so it addresses the given topic (a parody of Jabberwocky) without going off topic. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond surface, a motif of perseverance, careful preparation, and valor against a mechanical or metaphorical adversary (\"grindblade\") suggests an implied thematic level about struggle and tempering oneself. Detectable and consistent undertone/subtext present.

No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: identify distinct coined words (not canonical from reference or normal English):  \nmoonting, slyth’d, glist, frumious (canonical 'frumious' is from canonical), lorq, bemused (standard English), borogs (canonical), clawth, frabjous (canonical), zips, wraith’d, spinnerorq, vorp’d, toothring, banded, foreward, furks, scatters, fled, froth’d, hookwracks, snarrelings, newsly, glist’ning (variant), amain, warbled, forged, anal?, warthéd, tube (standard), furks, unseather, moonting, slyth’d, lorq, bemused, borogs.  \nCounting distinct coinages is somewhat ambiguous due to derivatives and partly standard English. At minimum about 8 distinct new coinages: moonting, slyth’d, glist, lorq, clawth, zips, spinnerorq, toothring, hookwracks, snarrelings, furks, unseather, foreward (possibly archaic 'foreword' misspelled).

No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas beyond incidental repeats.  \nExamples:  \nStanza 1: \"moonting blew\", \"slyth’d\", \"mome glist\", \"frumious\" - limited  \nStanza 2: \"Beware the clawth\", \"frabjous jaws\", \"spinnerorq lip\" – some alliteration of 'w'/'l' or 's' sounds? Possibly weak.  \nStanza 4: \"froth’d hookwracks, their snarrelings slain\" - 's' and 'h' sounds repeated, good alliteration.  \nStanza 7: \"tube of steel held in his grip\" - limited.  \nAt least 2 stanzas have clear alliteration/consonance. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: must be warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration in order.  \nWarning in stanza 2, preparation in stanza 3, encounter and decisive action in stanza 4, reflective in stanza 5-7, last stanza ring. Except no celebratory return, but arc beats order maintained up to decisive act. Partial return present as reflection but not celebration. Since celebration missing, arc incomplete but order OK up to decisive act. Treat as yes (arc in order, not interrupted), but query celebration fail.  \nYes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line exactly equals any line from canonical poem after normalization.  \nSome words repeated, but no full line verbatim per stanza. The ring stanzas repeat first stanza but wording changed (\"moonting\" instead of \"brillig\", \"slyth’d mome\" instead of \"slithy toves\"). So no verbatim canonical line. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Distinct canonical tokens ≤8, favoring new coinages.  \nCanonical tokens appearing: brillig, mome, borogs (variant of borogoves?), frumious, manxome, uffish, (also \"frabjous\" is canonical?), and \"beamish\" not present.  \nCount: brillig, mome, frumious, manxome, uffish - 5.  \nBorogs is possibly variant of borogoves (canonical), frabjous (canonical). Around 6 canonical tokens, ≤8 limit. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines ≈8-9 syllables, shorter lines ≈5-7.  \nSample stanza 1 lines approximate syllable counts:  \nLine 1: ’Twas brillig, the moonting blew (7-8 syll)  \nLine 2: And the slyth’d mome glist in war (7 syll)  \nLine 3: All frumious were the lorq sleeves (7-8 syll)  \nLine 4: And the bemused borogs all far (7 syll)  \nThe syllable pattern less clearly alternating longer/shorter, some lines all same length, so the 8/6 pattern is not well matched. Overall syllable count is less tight than Jabberwocky pattern. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) end rhymes across stanzas varied.  \nRhymes: far, drip, thought, spread, came, slip, blew, far again.  \n\"far\" repeated twice but not >2 times; no rhyme repeated excessive times. No exact end word reuse >2 times excluding ring echo. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no single content word overused >5 times or >8%.  \nWords like \"brillig\" once, \"moonting\" twice, \"mome\" twice, \"frumious\" twice, no overused content word detected. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: ≥4 distinct roots, no single suffix >50% of coinages.  \nCoinages vary: -ing (moonting, glist’ning), -’d (slyth’d, froth’d, warthéd), -orq (spinnerorq, hookwracks), compounding (toothring), unseather.  \nSufficient variety and distinct roots. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses the original theme of Jabberwocky-style fantastical combative poem, naming \"clawth\", \"hookwracks\", \"furks\" etc, matching the narrative of encounter and battle like Jabberwocky. No topic substitution. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: No obvious coherent undertone or deeper motif beyond superficial retelling or cryptic naming.

Look out!\" the zithern shiverings sang,  \nFor thither flapped, in sliding misty wraps,  \nThe prayer-flag, frayed, as gently-breathing fangs  \nDid crumble pebbly glyphs, as if on traps.  \n\nThen, with a quick and shivery-dervous call,  \nMy needleshanked blade flashed to the plight,  \nI shivered on, the edge both fierce and small,  \nAnd did what prayers, or daring dreams, alight.  \n\nThe Porvolope vanished, a smoggy sigh,  \nAnd once the riddle-puzzle 'midst the boulders,  \nMy own vastithrough world did deftly pry,  \nAs clear and crisp as a epoch's pebbleolders.  \n\nNow, with the wobbly pith secure, I hide  \nThe prayer-flag high, where eyelid snowflakes sway,  \nAnd hope, they say, in those high frizzles reside,  \nOh, heedless of the stones that night arrays.  \n\nReturn, return, and with your needleshanked blade,  \nFind wobbly pith and Zeppelin pikes once more,  \nAnd heed, my snar, the Zurgle in the shade  \nWhen mossy whispers weave through mossy lore.  \n\nSo, with that ending, echoing the first,  \nI trust you'll join to quest in wobbly pith,  \nThrough rising mists and shivered, shimmer-bursts,  \nOn wild and winding pathways, where we with.  \n\nIn wobbly pith the Zeppelin pikes glide through,  \nAs dawn's first breath begins to rustle crisp,  \nAnd fluttering prayer-flags, like dreams anew,  \nAdorn the heights, where winged adventures quip.", "info": {"topic": "summit prayer flag"}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>Title line is present (\"Vastithroughs\") before the first stanza, so yes.</C1_think>\n<C2_think>Count stanzas: The poem has 12 stanzas total. Many are quatrains, but the total stanza count (12) is above the 5–8 limit. Also, some stanzas are longer than four lines (there are 6-line stanzas). So fails on quatrain shape and stanza count range.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Checking ballad meter: lines alternate longer/shorter with ≥2 content-word difference in ≥60% of stanzas? The poem is irregular in meter, and many stanzas do not show alternating long/short pattern clearly. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>The rhyming pattern: in ≥60% of quatrains lines 2 and 4 rhyme (allowing slant rhyme), avoiding AABB dominance. Rhyming is inconsistent; some stanzas have slant or weak rhyme, and sometimes it is absent. There is no clear rhyme dominance or consistent rhyming scheme, so no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes the opening with at least 2 repeated content words/phrases or clear refrain? The last stanza repeats \"In wobbly pith the Zeppelin pikes glide through\", clearly echoing opening stanza's first line, and references \"prayer-flags\" that echo earlier \"prayer-flag\". More than two repeating content words/phrases appear, so yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition: The second stanza contains the line \"Beware the Porvolope, my snar, in snap\", a form of admonition to beware. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation by protagonist present? The third stanza features \"Prepare, with dare and daze, and will abide\", indicating resolve and readiness before encounter, so yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation with adversary? Fourth stanza describes the Porvolope swooping down with vivid imagery of attack, so yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive slaying or action? Sixth stanza mentions \"My needleshanked blade flashed to the plight\" and \"I did what prayers... alight,\" implying decisive action to resolve conflict, so yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration? Seventh stanza speaks of the Vanishing of Porvolope and reclaiming the world; eighth stanza shows securing the prayer-flag and hope; also later lines indicate return with blade. This indicates return and recovery, but celebratory tone is subdued rather than jubilant. It's borderline but more positive than neutral, so conservatively yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: identify distinct coined or invented words not canonical or standard English. Examples: \"Vastithroughs,\" \"wobbly pith,\" \"Zeppelin pikes,\" \"zithern,\" \"fritters,\" \"frizzing briskles,\" \"Porvolope,\" \"snar,\" \"helion,\" \"downled,\" \"thworrs,\" \"clangles,\" \"thurn,\" \"needleshanked,\" \"shivery-dervous,\" \"riddle-puzzle,\" \"epoch's pebbleolders,\" \"frizzles,\" \"Zurgle,\" \"shimmer-bursts.\" We count at least 12 unique coinages. So yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Does each stanza contain at least one coinage? Review stanzas quickly: Almost every stanza contains at least one coined term, except possibly stanza 9 which is somewhat vague but still has \"Zurgle.\" So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named non-canonical creature/entity central to action? The \"Porvolope\" is named, a fictional beast or entity, central to the confrontation. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Look for bursts like \"snicker-snack\", \"pop,\" \"hiss,\" or sound imitations. Terms like \"bellows,\" \"thworrs,\" \"clangles,\" are evocative but none are clearly onomatopoeic bursts or interjections that mimic sounds. No clear ‘burst’ onomatopoeia identified. So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas? Example: \"wobbly pith,\" \"prayer-flag,\" \"fritters whimper,\" \"shiver not nor thurn,\" \"shivered, shimmer-bursts,\" \"needleshanked blade flashed.\" At least two stanzas show clear use of alliteration or consonance beyond incidental repeats. So yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order (warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration)? The poem shows warning (stanza 2), preparation (stanza 3), encounter (stanza 4), decisive action (stanza 6), then return/celebration (stanzas 7-8). So yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim lines from canonical poem? No exact lines appear verbatim; all lines are different with different invented words. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens ≤8, favoring new coinages? Very few canonical tokens from Carroll’s lexicon appear (none of the canonical terms like brillig, toves, etc, are used). So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines about 8-9 syllables, shorter 5-7 syllables, alternating. Lines vary in syllable counts and are often long or irregular. Many lines exceed 9 syllables, and the alternation is inconsistent. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety across stanzas: The rhyme pattern is inconsistent and somewhat repetitive in rhyme choices; some rhymes repeat more than twice. So no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No word is overused excessively; coinaged content words are varied and distributed. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages include multiple distinct roots (\"Vastithroughs,\" \"Porvolope,\" \"Zithern,\" \"Helion,\" \"Needleshanked,\" \"Shivery-dervous,\" \"Zurgle,\" \"Frizzles,\" \"Twinkle,\" etc.) No single suffix dominates >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem appears to address a similar theme of a heroic confrontation with a named strange creature, very much in the spirit of Jabberwocky, no topic substitution. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is implied subtext in motifs of peril, bravery, journey through a strange environment, and overcoming an elusive foe. Subtle but present.

Requires all stanzas as quatrains and total stanzas between 5-8, but here stanzas vary and total is 10 (exceeds 8). Hence no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter: Lines do not consistently alternate longer/shorter with ≈2 content word diff in ≥60% of stanzas. Many stanzas are irregular, especially 3-liners/5-liners. Meter does not show clear longer-short alternation pattern consistently in ≥60% stanzas. No.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme: Some stanzas rhyme (esp. quatrains), often end lines 2 and 4 rhyme (e.g., \"toves/cove\", \"beam/dream\"). However, stanzas with 3 lines or 5 lines complicate pattern. AABB pattern is not prominently dominant but since stanza shapes vary and rhyme scheme is not strong or consistent in ≥60% stanzas, especially given mix of stanza lengths, no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Final stanza echoes opening with repeated content words \"parrel beads\", \"gaff\", and the return to theme of \"wobblewink\" presence on the gaff beads, giving a clear refrain feel. Meets the criterion for ≥2 repeated content words or phrases in final stanza echoing the opening. Yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Admonition: There is an explicit warning admonition stanza: \"Beware, I thought, the wobblewink, Whose gleam lured many to the brink.\" Clear caution to protagonist early. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: The protagonist prepares; \"I steadied nerve, and gripped the mast, Prepared to cast the die at last.\" A clear preparation phase before confrontation. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: The creature (wobblewink) appears and the protagonist draws blade to confront it. \"The wobblewink did thus emerge,\" plus describing the meeting. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: Protagonist attacks: \"I drew my blade... A swift cut sent the creature reeling,\" which resolves the encounter tension. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: The poem ends with protagonist safely back in port reflecting and telling tales, and toasting the beads; a homecoming and celebration. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage: Distinct invented coinages include wobblewink, brilling, parrel, pith (borderline standard but here seems coined), gaff (standard nautical), possibly bead-related (parrel?), twitchy word \"twinkling pith\" may be nonce but minor. Probably about 5-6 distinct novel coinages; fewer than 8. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage per stanza: Not every stanza contains a coinage; first stanza uses \"brilling,\" \"parrel,\" \"gaff\"; second stanza no clear coinage; \"wobblewink\" from stanza 3 onward; \"deck\" is English. Coinages are sparse and unevenly distributed. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creature: Wobblewink is named once, central to the poem, replacing Jabberwock. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: No clear onomatopoeic bursts (e.g., snicker-snack or equivalent sounds). \"A flash, a crash,\" is borderline but \"crash\" is standard English, and none repeated as bursts. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Some internal alliteration in a couple of stanzas, e.g. \"frisk and wriggle\", \"deck did ring\", \"swift cut sent\", but not strongly or clearly in ≥2 stanzas beyond incidental repeats.

No.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The arc beats—warning, preparation, encounter, decisive action, return—appear in correct canonical order: warning (stanza 3), preparation (4), encounter (5-6), decisive action (6-7), return (8-10). Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim lines: No exact line matches with canonical poem lines on normalization. All lines are original or altered, none verbatim. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical vocabulary: Use of canonical lexicon is very limited—\"slithy toves\", \"mimsy\" appear only once at start, no other canonical lexemes like \"borogoves\" or \"mome raths\". Canonical tokens definitely ≤8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Lines vary widely in syllable count; poem does not maintain 8-9 syllable longer lines and 5-7 shorter lines pattern consistently in quatrains; and many stanzas are not quatrains. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The rhyme pairs (mostly the 2nd and 4th lines) tend to repeat words like \"beads\", \"gleam/dream\", \"mast/last/decree\", \"keen/feeling/reeling\", minimal end word variety across stanzas; some rhyme endings repeated more than twice, no strong variance. No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overused excessively; no word occurs more than 5 times or greater than 8% content word frequency, apart from probably \"beads\" and \"gaff\" repeated but not exceeding threshold. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages seem to come mainly from the roots wobblewink, brill-, parrel, and variants related to bead imagery. Possibly about 3-4 distinct roots; no dominant suffix inflating numbers. Borderline but only 3-4 distinct roots counts as barely meeting minimum. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem sticks to the subject of a creature \"wobblewink\" and the protagonist’s encounter with it, mirroring Jabberwocky’s style and narrative. No evident subject substitution. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem has an implied subtext/motif of a sailor encountering a mysterious magical creature, facing fear, taking decisive action, and returning safely. The undertones of courage, supernatural threat, and seafaring life give a coherent subtext beyond surface action.
