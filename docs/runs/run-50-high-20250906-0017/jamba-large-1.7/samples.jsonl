All stanzas quatrains.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Check meter for each stanza: does line length alternate longer-shorter within stanza with ≥2 content-word difference in ≥60% (4 of 6) stanzas?  \n1st stanza somewhat uneven but borderline; 2nd stanza lines less clearly alternating length; 3rd stanza lines length closer; 4th stanza lines almost uniform in syllable count; 5th stanza lines differ significantly; 6th stanza lines more uniform.  \nOverall fewer than 4 stanzas clearly show alternating long/short lines with 2+ content-word difference.  \nVerdict: no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (2,4) of each stanza:  \n1st stanza: hums/sums (slant rhyme, acceptable)  \n2nd stanza: twine/mime (full rhyme)  \n3rd stanza: weight/gait (full rhyme)  \n4th stanza: zest/sits (near rhyme, more off)  \n5th stanza: dim/slim (rhyme)  \n6th stanza: untamed/remain (no rhyme)  \n5 of 6 stanzas have rhyme (2,4). No evidence of AABB dominance as stanza rhymes are mostly ABAB or not AABB.  \n≥60% stanzas rhyme (2,4) - yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza echoes the first stanza only marginally, but it recalls \"And has thou slain the Glistenkraken?\", \"Returnest now ...\", and a warning \"Beware its sway...\"  \nAlthough there are a few repeated words/phrases (Beware, Glistenkraken), no clear refrain identical to initial stanza lines or repeated significant phrases.  \nNot an exact ring composition, but partial echo in title/creature and warning. Presence of repeated words but <2 in a stanza common phrase lacking; yes for minimal echo but question demands ≥2 repeated content words or a clear refrain.  \nGiven the weaker echo, answer no.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early caution admonition is present in stanza 2: “Beware the Glistenkraken, my son!” and further warnings follow. Clear admonition.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: stanza 3 shows “Its reel was swung with spooled intent,” and “The bandage tape, it writhed and bent,\" suggesting some preparation or wielding of an instrument before the encounter. Indirect, but present.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: the 4th stanza describes clicking, ticking, coils unspun, fizzled fits - the movement/action of the creature or interaction is described, and stanza 5 has “One, two! Its arms were thrust and spun,” and loud sounds, suggesting the encounter/confrontation. Clear meeting.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>A decisive act is present in stanza 5: “And with a snap, it all was done,” indicating an action that ends the conflict (the “entropy hissed like slim” implies resolution).</C9_think>\n<C10_think>The return or celebration is weak or absent; stanza 6 has “And has thou slain the Glistenkraken? Returnest now with spoils untamed,” suggesting return, but no jubilant acknowledgement or joyous tone.

Mostly follow canonical order.  \nLate warning in stanza 6 is unusual but not out of order arc-wise. Partial caution at end; primary sequence is maintained: yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines exactly match canonical poem lines; wording original with invented words and phrasing.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens present: beware, and, the, my, son, with, long, he, it, and, one, two, then, went, and, callooh, callay, “has thou”.  \nCanonical coinages used? No “brillig,” “slithy,” “toves,” etc.  \nCanonical tokens are either standard English or ≤8 canonical invented words from source poem, so canonical budget ≤8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Line syllable counts roughly approximate Jabberwocky metric pattern (long lines ~8-9 syllables, shorter lines ~5-7).  \nFirst stanza longer lines 8-9 syllables; shorter lines 5-7; consistent across quatrains.  \nMost quatrains have reasonable syllable tightness, so yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme end (2,4) words: hums/sums, twine/mime, weight/gait, zest/sits (slant), dim/slim, untamed/remain (no rhyme),  \nMost rhymes vary; no exact end word reused more than 2 times excluding ring echo. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: no single content word is excessively repeated (>5 or >8% of content words). “Beware” appears twice, “Glistenkraken” a few times but not over the threshold. No overuse found.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show diverse roots: brimmish, squeetch, skirr, spickled, reelick, waxwhirrs, drainchime, mazy, spinnery etc.  \nNo single suffix dominates >50%, at least 4 distinct roots seen. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem is a clear homage/parody of Jabberwocky focusing on the “Glistenkraken,” an invented creature and fairly direct adaptation of the original arc and style.  \nTopic clearly addressed, no substitution of unrelated topic. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem implies a motif of hazardous challenge with playful tension around an elusive, dangerous creature with caution and fight.  \nThe final stanza’s mixed warning and return suggest lingering threat, complex undertone.  \nYes, coherent subtext present.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.875, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.875, "criteria_yes": 21, "label": "high"}

No for strictness.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present: stanza 2 begins \"Beware the Snedge, my son! The jaws that snatch...\" clearly a warning. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Protagonist preparation before encounter: stanza 3 \"He took his laying stick in hand... So rested he by the H&J stand, And stood awhile in thought.\" This signals preparation, pause, resolve. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter: stanza 4 has direct meeting \"And as in uppish wrath he stood, The Snedge, with eyes of flame, Came whiffling from the chase and wood, And burbled as it came!\" Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive act resolving tension: stanza 5, \"One, two! One, two! And through and through The laying stick went snick-snack! He left it printless, clean and true,\" indicates the action striking the foe followed by leaving it defeated. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and jubilant acknowledgement: The last stanza is more somber, descriptive, and lacks a triumphant or celebratory tone like original. No joyous \"O frabjous day!\" or congratulation. No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Distinct invented coinages count: \"Brillike,\" \"reglets,\" \"kiltered,\" \"Quirkling,\" \"Snedge,\" \"Rumbledook,\" \"frumious\" (canonical), \"laire,\" \"uppish,\" \"snick-snack\"(variant on canonical \"snicker-snack\"), \"laying stick\" (not coinage) - at least 8 distinct novel coinages (excluding canonical words), yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least 1 coinage:  \n- stanza 1: Brillike, reglets, kiltered  \n- stanza 2: Snedge, Rumbledook, frumious (canonical), laire  \n- stanza 3: laying stick? (not coinage), Quirkling  \n- stanza 4: uppish  \n- stanza 5: snick-snack (variant of canonical but new form)  \n- stanza 6: printless? (standard English), turned back (standard)  \n- stanza 7: Brillike, fonted, fontfight, reglet’s  \nSo each stanza has some invented words or forms. Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: The Snedge (not canonical) is named and is the antagonist. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeic bursts: \"snick-snack\" (variant of canonical \"snicker-snack\") is present; also \"burbled\" (canonical) but only one clear onomatopoeia burst variant (snick-snack). Need ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts. Only one distinct clear onomatopoeia. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas:  \n- stanza 2: \"jaws that snatch, the claws that snare\" (alliteration of 's' and 'sn')  \n- stanza 5: \"stick went snick-snack\" (alliteration 'st' and 'sn')  \nAt least two stanzas with clear consonance/alliteration beyond incidental. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration  \nHere: stanza 2 warning, 3 prep, 4 encounter, 5 decisive act, 7 attempt return but no celebration. The sequence is preserved in order, no inversion. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines exactly matching canonical poem lines (normalized). Most lines are different wording, no identical line found. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens ≤8: \"frumious\" and \"burbled\" present canonical coinages, also \"whiffling\" reused? Only \"frumious\", \"burbled\", \"whiffling\" from canonical lexicon, total 3. Under 8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count: longer lines ~8-9 syllables, shorter lines ~5-7 syllables, alternating in ≥60% of stanzas. Some lines fit roughly, but some lines are less tight meter: \"And with its head, he turned back.\" (6 syllables), \"He took his laying stick in hand:\" (7 syllables), somewhat looser than canonical pattern. Given borderline, answer no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes vary, with no end word reused more than twice (except ring echo which is negative here). Repetitions minimal. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No word overused excessively—no single content word >5 times or >8% of content words. \"Brillike\" repeated twice, \"reglet(s)\" 3 times approx. Within limits. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages have at least 4 distinct roots: \"brillike,\" \"reglet,\" \"kiltered,\" \"quirkling,\" \"snedge,\" \"rumbledook,\" \"laying stick,\" \"snick-snack,\" \"uppish,\" \"fonted,\" \"fontfight.\" Multiple distinct roots with no suffix dominating >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-style encounter involving named creatures and a protagonist, matching the theme. No substitution of different subject. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/motif: Beyond surface action, no strong or consistent undertone or symbolic motif beyond literal battle with creature is detectable. No clear subtext or implied deeper layer.

Majority do not strongly alternate long/short lines with required metric difference. No clear evidence for ≥60% stanzas meeting this.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (2,4) in ≥60% stanzas with avoidance of AABB: \n- 1st stanza: gears/dance (no rhyme)\n- 2nd stanza: keen/clings (slant rhyme? no—not clear)\n- 3rd stanza: prepared/part (no)\n- 4th stanza: retort/bare (no rhyme)\n- 5th stanza: held/bound (no rhyme)\n- 6th stanza: son/song (near rhyme)\nMostly no rhyming 2/4 lines; less than 60% produce rhyme at (2,4). Thus no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Final stanza echoes the opening stanza partly (use of \"And has thou conquered Balance Spring?\" echoes sense of challenge, and the last stanza includes similar celebratory tone like the original final stanza). However, no direct word/phrase repetition of ≥2 content words or clear refrain from opening stanza. Opening is about \"brillbrass\" and \"spinning gears,\" final stanza doesn't repeat these content words. Hence no clear ring echo.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present? Second stanza contains repeated “Beware, beware, the Balance Spring!\" with cautionary language, i.e., an admonition to protagonist early on.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Protagonist prepares before encounter: The third stanza depicts \"The horologist, with tools prepared,\" approaching with \"practiced art,\" indicating preparation before engagement.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter between protagonist and adversary: Fourth stanza describes the confrontation with the Balance Spring with personification and interaction (\"chirped and clicked,\" force laid bare), fitting encounter/confrontation stage.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: Fifth stanza describes an action \"snicked! the spring was tightly felled,\" representing a decisive, resolving act.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Final stanza has a celebratory tone, addressing the protagonist (\"Come to my arms, thou careful son!\"), acknowledging successful conquest – meeting the return and celebration criterion.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Invented coinages count: bri llb rass, horologe, collet, mainspring, tremblous, retort (used as noun here), pinions, snicked! Possibly “spinning gears” is standard English, no coinage there. Distinct coinages identified: brillbrass, horologe, collet, mainspring, tremblous, pinions (arguably English but specialized), snicked! (onomatopoeic), so roughly 6-7. Probably less than 8 new distinct invented words.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinages spread: Each stanza contains at least one coined or specialized word:\n- stanza1: brillbrass (coinage), gears (common),\n- stanza2: Balance Spring (named entity), oscillations (common),\n- stanza3: horologist, collet (technical but valid coined/obscure),\n- stanza4: retort (used in unusual sense, okay),\n- stanza5: snicked!, concentric,\n- stanza6: deft, wrung (common)\nOverall, minimal coinage presence in last stanza; it's thin. So borderline, but probably ≥1 coinage per stanza if counting technical coinages.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named central to action - named non-canonical creature/entity other than Jabberwocky: The poem focuses on \"Balance Spring,\" a horological part, named and protagonist interacts with it as adversary. Balance Spring is a named entity central to the action.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia ≥2: “snicked!” in stanza 5 is onomatopoeic. Any others? “chirped and clicked\" in stanza 4 uses onomatopoeic verbs. So yes, at least two onomatopoeic bursts: \"chirped,\" \"clicked,\" and \"snicked!\"</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas: Check for repeated consonant sounds within lines in multiple stanzas:\n- stanza1: \"spinning,\" \"spiral\" — no spiral but \"spinning gears,\" \"gyre and click\" (g's repeated),\n- stanza2: \"Balance Spring\" shows 's' consonance,\n- stanza4: \"chirped and clicked with tremblous care\" - 'c' and 't' alliteration,\n- stanza5: \"snicked! the spring was tightly felled,\" 's' alliteration,\nAt least two stanzas with clear alliteration and consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Canonical narrative arc in order (warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration):\n- stanza2: warning,\n- stanza3: preparation,\n- stanza4: encounter,\n- stanza5: decisive act,\n- stanza6: return/celebration.\nOrder is canonical.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Check for verbatim lines matching canonical poem (ignoring whitespace/dashes): No exact lines match the canonical Jabberwocky poem lines exactly. Words like ‘’Twas’ used, but line phrasing differs substantially—answer yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens count: instances of canonical words: brillig partially replaced as \"brillbrass\" (not canonical), some jabberwocky words present:\n- “Did gyre” (common),\nBut most canonical tokens are missing except \"brill-\" root. Less than 8 canonical tokens, favoring coinages.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines about 8-9 syllables, shorter lines 5-7:\nExamples:\n- stanza1 line1: ‘’Twas brillbrass’ (4 syll), line2: \"Did gyre and click in orbital dance,\" (9 syll) — matches longer line\n- line3: ‘As mainspring wound its unseen sphere’ (8/9),\n- line4: ‘A horologe took its grandstand chance’ (8/9).\nOverall line lengths reasonably match Jabberwocky’s pattern of alternating longer/shorter lines per stanza lines, though the longer/shorter alternation is less strict because mostly lines about equal length. So syllable counts per line fit reasonable tightness for all lines. However, the alternating pattern is not clear (cf. C3). The criterion requires every stanza to have longer lines ~8-9, shorter lines ~5-7 syllables. Since all 4 lines quite long, no clear short lines; so no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Few or no (2,4) rhymes consistent, so no rhyme variety established. End words vary widely but no repeated end-rhyme more than twice, so yes in that sense; but since rhyme presence low (C4_no), overall no rhyme variety.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No single content word seems overused. Words like \"Balance Spring\" repeated but considered phrase, used few times. No content word used excessively. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Multiple distinct roots present (e.g., brillbrass, horologe, collet, mainspring, tremblous, pinions). No single suffix dominates >50%. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a clockwork mechanism (“Balance Spring”), a defined subject distinct from Jabberwocky but in similar style. So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext beyond surface action: Metaphor of time, precision, struggle with mechanical “foe,” possibly symbolizing challenges with craftsmanship or control over time—detectable motif beyond literal description. So yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.75, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.75, "criteria_yes": 18, "label": "medium"}

Borderline but mostly not strong, so no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (2,4) in ≥60% stanzas needed and no AABB dominance. Rhyme pairs mostly present (e.g., \"feasts\"/\"plead\" is slant but not a strong rhyme), many are imperfect or approximate rhymes.

Final stanza repeats \"Beware, beware the mesh-mawed beast,\" echoing stanza 2 intro line exactly; also first stanza has \"nib tine\" and last stanza references \"mesh-mawed beast\". However, final stanza does not echo the first stanza directly in content words, but rather repeats warning line from stanza 2. The very last stanza echoes an earlier admonition more than opening stanza. Ring echo usually requires last stanza to echo first stanza.

The poem exhibits some variation but does not consistently alternate line lengths across ≥60% stanzas; mostly line lengths are moderate and do not show clear long/short alternation.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme is generally present with rhyme between lines 2 and 4 in most stanzas, though some rhyme pairs are slant or imperfect. Rhyme scheme AABB is not dominant; mostly ABAB or ABCB is observed. However, the rhymes do not appear strong in ≥60% stanzas (some stanzas have no clear rhyme). </C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza echoes the opening stanza in theme (shade of the tree, kyūsu pot) but lacks ≥2 identical content words or an explicit refrain like the canonical ring composition. The repeated words are only general and insufficient.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>There is an explicit admonition: \"Beware the drip, my dear Sencha-seeker,\" and \"Beware,\" repeated later, satisfying warning criterion.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation is present: the protagonist \"With nimble hands, a tilt was made,\" \"gripped, and turned the pot with a deft curl\" before the encounter episode; clearly shows a deliberate preparation act.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>A clear encounter happens as the drip misbehaves, and the pot \"gave a sudden sneeze,\" presenting the obstacle and confrontation.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action occurs: the protagonist calms the pour, \"The pour became smooth, the drip serene,\" effectively resolving the tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>There is a return/homecoming: \"Back to the shade of the baozhong tree,\" with the pot now \"a hero now,\" and the tone is celebratory and calm - a modest but recognizable return and celebration.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages or invented words are relatively sparse. \"Kyūsu,\" \"boazhong,\" \"Sencha-seeker,\" \"murky surge,\" \"amber cascade,\" \"wends\" (arguably archaic usage), \"wily stain\" (metaphoric, not coinage), and a few others. Counting clearly invented or non-shop-English coined terms yields fewer than 8 distinct ones.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinages do not appear in every stanza; some stanzas have only standard English words (\"Then a hiss, a clink, a clatter of glass,\" has some onomatopoeia but no coinages). Many stanzas lack invented words clearly.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>The named entity \"kyūsu\" is a real object (a type of Japanese teapot), not a fantastical creature/entity. No non-canonical creature/entity is named as an adversary or in central action, so this is no.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>There are onomatopoeic bursts: \"hiss,\" \"clink,\" \"clatter,\" and \"sneeze,\" with \"hiss\" and \"clink\" especially onomatopoeic and used multiple times. At least two onomatopoeic bursts present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration or consonance is present in some lines: \"steep of a tall baozhong tree,\" \"steam like whispers wends,\" \"pot under a steady eye.\" However, only about 1-2 stanzas display very clear substantial alliteration beyond incidental; meets minimal threshold of ≥2 stanzas with clear alliteration/consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>The arc beats appear in canonical order: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration. The poem is structured following this narrative order clearly.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines exactly match the canonical poem lines verbatim upon normalization, so no verbatim line problem.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens from reference poem (\"brillig,\" \"slithy,\" \"toves,\" etc.) are absent or zero; canonical budget is well within ≤8 tokens, favorable to new coinages.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>The poem’s meter is more free-form; syllable counts vary, no consistent pattern of longer lines ≈8–9 syllables and shorter lines ≈5–7 across all quatrains; many lines too short or too long irregularly - syllable tightness not maintained reliably.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: some repetition of rhyme words across stanzas occurs (\"seen\" and \"green\" rhymes, for example), but no exact end word repeated >2 times excluding ring echo (which is minimal here). Rhyme variety is okay.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word is overused; repeated words like “brew,” “pot,” “drip” are natural but do not exceed 5 times or 8% of all content words. Lexical repetition is guarded.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages are few and somewhat similar (mostly Japanese tea terms: kyūsu, baozhong, Sencha) - arguably fewer than 4 distinct roots; suffixes are minimal given limited coinages; coinage variety is low.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>The poem clearly addresses the tea-making topic consistent with a “Jabberwocky” style poem about a tea pot and drip. The topic is evident and not substituted.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext is detectable: chaos vs. order, nature vs. human control, the tension underlying a seemingly peaceful tea process.
