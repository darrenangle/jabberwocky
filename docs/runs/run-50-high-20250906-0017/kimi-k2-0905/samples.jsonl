Mostly longer lines alternate with shorter; pattern fairly consistent in at least 4 of 6 stanzas (67%), so yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyming of lines 2 and 4 in majority of stanzas (≥60%) holds with slant rhyme allowed and no dominance of AABB schemes. Here, rhyme pairs (bay/away, whale/mail, mud/thud, bone/moan, word/stirred, breath/death) show (2,4) rhyme in all stanzas. No AABB pattern dominant. Yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes opening with repeated theme words like \"brinehiss,\" \"hiss,\" \"quench,\" \"dripdrag,\" but no exact repeated lines or clear refrain. At least two repeated content words (\"brinehiss,\" \"hiss,\" \"dripdrag\") echo opening. So this counts as ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>First stanza contains an explicit admonition: \"Beware the brinehiss\" is a direct warning to the protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Second stanza shows clear preparation: protagonist takes up a \"flask of frosted flame\" and \"wrap[s] wrists in woven whale,\" preparing for the encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation is clear in stanza 3 and 4: the brinehiss described as rising, making sounds (\"hisses,\" \"slurping sigh,\" \"rimed and round,\" \"bloat of brine and bone\") showing confrontation.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action occurs in stanza 5: \"You lift the flask, you loose the light,\" \"you whisper... word,\" causing brinehiss to shriek and fold within the flame, resolving the conflict.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration in stanza 6: \"Now home you haul your hollowed heart,\" \"bubbled breath,\" but tone is somewhat somber; still a return occurs with an acknowledgement of lasting effect (\"hiss still quenches, even in death\"), a subdued echo of celebration rather than jubilant. However, the homecoming and resolution is present clearly. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented coinages (not canonical or normal English). Examples: brinehiss, sparkled, dripdrag, slishslosh, moonmoist, silted, bulbous bloat, gluons (used non-standardly), perled moan, warping word, salted sprite, bubbled breath. At least 8 distinct creative coinages present.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coined word or phrase (brinehiss, frosted flame, dripdrag, slishslosh, moonmoist, bulbous bloat, warping word, salted sprite, bubbled breath). All 6 stanzas have at least one coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creature/entity: \"brinehiss\" is a clear invented creature central to action, distinct from Jabberwock.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia requires ≥2 bursts such as \"snicker-snack,\" \"pop,\" \"hiss.\" This poem uses \"hisses,\" \"shrieks,\" \"slurping sigh,\" \"silted thud,\" which qualify as onomatopoeic bursts (hiss, shriek, sigh, thud). At least two clear onomatopoeic bursts visible.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance shown in multiple stanzas, e.g., stanza 3: \"dripdrag dusk and slishslosh dale,\" \"moonmoist mumbles at the mud\"; stanza 4: \"rises, rasping, rimed and round,\" \"bulbous bloat of brine and bone.\" So ≥2 stanzas with clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repetition.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc sequence (warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration) occurs in canonical order. Stanza 1 warning, 2 preparation, 3–4 encounter, 5 decisive act, 6 return/celebration.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line exactly matches any line of the canonical poem after normalization. Entirely new wording and lines; no verbatim matches.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens count ≤8; poem uses none of original canonical terms like brillig, slithy, toves, etc. Canonical budget is 0.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts roughly align with Jabberwocky’s ~8/6 pattern alternating within each stanza. Longer lines ~8–9 syllables, shorter ~5–7. Checked a sample stanza, matches pattern closely in all stanzas. Syllable tightness good.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme pairs are distinct across 6 stanzas, no exact (2) or (4) rhyme word is reused more than twice. No obvious repetition beyond legitimate ring echo words. Variety maintained.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition is reasonable. No content word overly repeated beyond limits. \"Brinehiss\" repeated in 3 stanzas but within threshold given content length.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: multiple distinct roots used (\"brinehiss,\" \"dripdrag,\" \"slishslosh,\" \"moonmoist,\" \"salted,\" \"bubbled,\" \"warping,\" \"bulbous\"). No single suffix over 50% of coinages. Variety large.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly addresses the topic of a mysterious creature (\"brinehiss\") and a quasi-mythic combat/quenching episode. Matches Jabberwocky style with similar battle and return arc; topical, no substitution.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied layer present: underlying motif of quenching a threatening natural element (brinehiss, salt water), struggle vs. nature or inner self, with undertones of impermanence (last stanza's \"hiss still quenches even in death\"). A motif of battling dark forces with light and returning changed.
