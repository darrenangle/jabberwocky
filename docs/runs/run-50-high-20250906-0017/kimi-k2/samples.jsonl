Here, most stanzas show some line length variation but not clearly systematic or consistent for ≥60%. The alternation pattern is inconsistent and less strong than in Jabberwocky, so fails.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>The rhyme scheme in ≥60% stanzas should have rhyme on lines 2 and 4 avoiding AABB dominance. Here rhyme pattern is mostly ABAB or ABCB; some stanzas clearly rhyme lines 2/4 with slant rhymes or exact; no strong AABB dominance. Rhyme on lines 2,4 is present in at least 5 of 7 stanzas, so yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza echoes the first stanza with nearly identical lines repeated (e.g. “Beware the brackish brindle-brew...” and the whole stanza closely mirrors the opening stanza). Ring composition is clearly present.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>An early admonition/warning is present in the first stanza using phrase “Beware the brackish brindle-brew, my child,” which is a direct admonition analogous to the original poem’s \"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!\".</C6_think>\n<C7_think>The protagonist prepares by taking up a \"tawny tincture-tube\" and clasping the \"clinking color-claw\" before the encounter, indicating a tool and resolve, fulfilling preparation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>There is a clear encounter between protagonist and adversary in stanza 3 and 4: the “spraddle-spawn with slurping skin” emerges and the protagonist grabs a tool and attacks it. Thus encounter/confrontation is evident.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive act is present in stanza 4 where the creature “cracked” after the protagonist’s strike, resolving the tension decisively.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>There is a return/homecoming and a notion of safety restored in stanza 5 (“Now hasten home… Let no drip darken dwelling door”), indicating a celebratory return. Although less jubilant than Jabberwocky, it clearly implies relief and success.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count of distinct invented coinages (non-standard English and not canonical Jabberwock words) is at least 10: “Plum-Blueing”, “brackish”, “brindle-brew”, “bubbled blues”, “drangle-drops”, “tawny tincture-tube”, “clinking color-claw”, “gurglegloom”, “spraddle-spawn”, “clawed”, “crawlied”, “rivels”, “sudded”. Many words seem coined, exceeding 8 distinct coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coined word or phrase, so coinage is spread throughout all stanzas.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>A non-canonical creature/entity named and central to the action is the “spraddle-spawn” in stanza 3, which is clearly the adversary, fulfilling this criterion.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>The poem uses onomatopoeia minimally or not clearly: “Swish!” is one onomatopoeia; “clinking”, “cracked” are less clearly onomatopoeic bursts like “snicker-snack”. Only one strong onomatopoeic burst, not ≥2, so no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration and consonance are very frequent: examples include “brackish brindle-brew”, “plum meets brown in bubbled blues”, “clinking color-claw”, “gilded grappling-glass”, “slurping skin”, “sterling stroke”, “pigment-prowler’s pulled apart” across multiple stanzas (≥2). Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>The canonical arc order is warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration. This poem follows that order smoothly: warning (stanza 1), preparation (2), encounter (3), decisive act (4), return (5), and ring echo (7). Arc order preserved.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line exactly matches any line from canonical poem after normalization, so yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens are minimal: “Beware” and “my child” appear; no canonical Jabberwock terms are reused, so canonical token count ≤8; favoring new coinages.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>The syllable pattern is not strict but most longer lines have ~8–9 syllables and shorter lines ~5–7, roughly matching Jabberwocky’s pattern across all quatrains. Evidence suggests syllable tightness is mostly maintained.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme endings for lines 2 and 4 are varied throughout the poem; no single rhyme repeated more than twice, except possibly the ring echo which is allowed. Therefore, rhyme variety is adequate.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word is overused excessively outside the ring echo; lexicon is diverse with no word used over 5 times or 8% of content words.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages have ≥4 distinct roots (“brindle”, “tincture”, “claw”, “gloom”, “spawn”, “glass”, “stoke”, “prowler”, “drangle” etc.), and no suffix dominates more than 50%, so coinage variety is present.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic is clearly adhered to, with the poem addressing a strange bath/creature encounter as an analog to Jabberwocky’s theme; the subject is coherent to the poem’s own mythic narrative, so yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>The poem implies a layered subtext of a dangerous or corrupted bath (“brackish brindle-brew”), a test or rite involving colors and stains, perhaps symbolizing struggle with change or identity. This coherent undertone is detectable across the poem.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.9166666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.9166666666666666, "criteria_yes": 22, "label": "high"}

 \nHe twirled the twystle-stoppering with fingers faintly franked.  \nHe sniffled once, he sniffled twice, and felt the fumelet flit—  \nThen corked the clockwork bottle back and tucked it in his kit.  \n\nOut from the vat of vaporous dusk, the Snifferclomp arose,  \nA patchouled puff with peppered paws and petals in its throes.  \nIts tongue was tonka-tinctured, its tail a musky vine—  \nIt crooned a cloud of cumin-crust and clary-clove combine.  \n\nOne whiff, one whir, one waffling whirl, one whisk of whelming spice—  \nHe flung the flitch of flinty fume and pinned it in a trice.  \nThe creature coughed a cardamon chord, collapsed in cardamom snow.  \nHe bottled it in benzoin bliss; he let the leavings go.  \n\nHe trundled home through thistle-dusk, the atomer still hot—  \nThe civet curled within the glass, the drydown tied in knot.  \n“Oh fragrant frabjous day!” he cried, and danced with dappled dray—  \nFor he had tamed the tonka-tide—and none could sniff away.  \n\nBewarb, bewarb, the civet-note; it squiffles still afar—  \nThat glimmers in the gloaming and gleams like bottled star.  \nYet drydown drifts, and drydown drops—it waits in amber gleam—  \nSo mind the musk, the murmured husk, that haunts the haunt of dream.", "info": {"topic": "civet note and drydown"}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>Title line is non-empty and separate from stanza text, present before first stanza.</C1_think>\n<C2_think>There are 7 stanzas, each with exactly 4 lines, so all quatrains and stanza count is within 5–8.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>The line length alternation in ≥60% stanzas is not clearly evident;

A thrumbling tone, a buzz beneath the brain,  \nIt twirled through dreams and drummed on seams of sanity’s domain;  \nOne, two! One, two! He clapped the thought, he snuffed the wisping sound—  \nHe left it wrung in moonlight where its echo-dust lay drowned.  \n\n“And hast thou slain the Orin Bell? The hum that haunts the hush?”  \n“O child, I quelled its quivering tongue, its ever-quilted crush.”  \nHe wandered home through twilight’s hush, the air now still and numb—  \nYet somewhere soft, a susurrus... the faintest Orin Bell Hum.  \n\n’Twas brimsy in the glistermorn, the slithy torms did spin,  \nThe borogroves still whiffling out their toves beneath the bin—  \nBeware the Orin Bell Hum, my child, it murmurs still, though dumb...  \nIt waits in hush and hush again: the echo’s Orin Bell Hum.", "info": {"topic": "orin bell hum"}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>Title line \"**The Orin Bell Hum**\" is present before first stanza, non-empty and separate from stanza text.</C1_think>\n<C2_think>There are 5 stanzas, all quatrains with 4 lines each; stanza count 5 is within 5–8 inclusive.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Analyze meter pattern: majority of stanzas show alternation of longer and shorter lines with ≥2 content-word difference. Stanza 1 lines alternate longer/shorter; stanza 2 also shows alternation; stanza 3 also. So ≥3/5=60% met. Yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhymes of lines 2 and 4 exist with slant or full rhyme in at least 3 stanzas (1,3,4), and rhyme scheme is mostly ABAB or similar (not AABB). No stanza is strictly AABB dominant. Thus ≥60% rhyme (3/5=60%) is met.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza clearly echoes the first stanza with many repeated content words/phrases (\"’Twas brimsy in the glistermorn,\" \"slithy torms,\" \"borogroves,\" \"whiffling,\" \"toves,\" \"beneath the bin,\" \"Beware the Orin Bell Hum\"). This is a clear ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition is present in stanza 1 with \"Beware the Orin Bell Hum, my child, that murmurs in the gloam,\" clearly cautioning the protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation is present: Protagonist \"took his vorpal thoughts in hand,\" and \"cloak of calmness he wrapped the doubts,\" showing mental armament/preparation before encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter is clear in stanza 3: \"Then came the Hum! A thrumbling tone,\" \"One, two! One, two! He clapped the thought, he snuffed the wisping sound,\" describing confrontation with the Hum.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action in stanza 3 with him clapping and snuffing the sound, “He left it wrung in moonlight,” resolving the tension definitively.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration in stanza 4: \"He wandered home... the air now still and numb,\" and a quiet acknowledgment of the subdued threat, though subdued mood; a form of return and recognition is present, albeit subtle but clear.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Invented coinages include brimsy, glistermorn, slithy torms, borogroves (close but borogroves is canonical), whiffling (canonical), toves (canonical), Orin Bell Hum (new creature/entity), echo-halls, whisper-walls, thrumbling, drummed, snuffed, wisping, quivering, quilted, susurrus, hush, echo-dust, and others. Counting distinct coinages beyond canonical ones: brimsy, glistermorn, torms, borogroves is canonical, whiffling canonical, Orin Bell Hum new, echo-halls, whisper-walls, thrumbling, snuffed (standard English), quilted (standard). So at least 8 distinct coinages beyond canonical? Let's count strictly: brimsy, glistermorn, torms, echo-halls, whisper-walls, thrumbling, snuffed (common word, likely no), quivering/common, quilted/common, susurrus (dictionary, but obscure English), wisping (common). About 6–7 clearly invented coinages. So less than 8 clearly. So no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Most stanzas have at least one coinage: 1 has brimsy, glistermorn, torms; 2 has cloak of calmliness (calmliness unclear coinage), echo-halls, whisper-walls; 3 has thrumbling; 4 has susurrus; 5 has brimsy, glistermorn. So all 5 stanzas have ≥1 coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature named is \"Orin Bell Hum,\" a non-canonical entity, central to poem's action and subject.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: No overt onomatopoeic bursts like \"snicker-snack\" or \"Pop!\" In stanza 3, \"One, two! One, two!\" is rhythmic but not onomatopoeic burst. \"Thrumbling tone\" and \"buzz\" are descriptive but not bursts. So no clear onomatopoeia bursts ≥2.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration and consonance: Examples like \"slithy torms did spin,\" \"borogroves... beneath the bin,\" \"whisper-walls are thin,\" \"silent thoughts,\" \"snuffed the wisping sound\" show alliteration but mostly single instances. At least 2 stanzas show clear within-line alliteration beyond incidental repeats, yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza 1), preparation (stanza 2), encounter (stanza 3), decisive act (stanza 3), return/celebration (stanza 4), ring echo (stanza 5). The order is canonical.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line verbatim matching the reference poem. All lines are new or altered sufficiently.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token count: borogroves, slithy, toves appear. Canonical tokens ≤8, and spread is low. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Long lines mostly 8–9 syllables, short lines mostly 5–7 syllables in quatrains, consistent with Jabberwocky metric pattern.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: End rhymes of lines 2 and 4 differ across stanzas, no end word reused >2 times (apart from ring echo). Thus yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard holds: only moderate repetition of key content words (e.g., \"Hum\" appears multiple times but under limits), no single content word overused above threshold.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show variety with at least 4 distinct roots: brimsy, glistermorn, torm, echo-hall, whisper-wall, thrumbling, susurrus. No single suffix dominates over 50%.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem clearly addresses the topic of a Jabberwocky-style encounter with a named (non-Jabberwock) creature, \"Orin Bell Hum,\" matching requested style.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond surface, poem hints at mental struggle, quiet but persistent internal \"Hum\" as metaphor for anxiety or intrusive thought, coherent undertone throughout.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.9166666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.9166666666666666, "criteria_yes": 22, "label": "high"}
