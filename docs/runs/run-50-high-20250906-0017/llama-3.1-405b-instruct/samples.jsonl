Rhyme in at least 5 of 7 stanzas is sound; so yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes the first stanza’s wording and canonical lines; specifically repeats canonical phrases \"’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves / Did gyre and gimble…\" and about 2 or more repeated content words; clear ring composition present.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present in second stanza with “Beware the ebonite feed, my son! … Beware the softball pitch and shun …” matching canonical warning style.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation or armament: taking \"vorpal mouse in hand\" and \"Long time the ebonite foe he sought\" plus resting by server stand shows preparation phase before encounter; so yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: The ebonite feed comes “whiffling through the network deep,” with auditory and visual action, a clear meeting with adversary.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: “One, two! One, two!

Callooh! Callay! / He chortled in his joy.” Jubilant return present.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented coinages excluding canonical ones. Coinages include: ebonite, byte(s), softball pitch, frumious fender’s fret (fender’s?), vorpal mouse (vorpal canonical but mouse is common English?), server stand, hibernation, network deep, snicker-snack (canonical), network flew, lost its track. Some are standard English or canonical. Coinages distinctly new: ebonite, softball, fender’s fret (fret?), hibernation (normal word), server stand (compound). Total distinct novel coinages somewhat low (under 8), many are normal English or canonical or close to normal tech terms. So no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Check if each stanza has ≥1 coinage. Not all stanzas have clear coinages; for example opening stanza has “ebonite feed” (coinage), second stanza “ebonite feed,” “frumious fender's fret” (mixed canonical and questionable coinage), third stanza “vorpal mouse” (vorpal canonical), fourth stanza “ebonite feed” and “bytes” (bytes standard word), fifth stanza “vorpal mouse,” “snicker-snack” (canonical), sixth stanza “ebonite beast” (coinage variation), seventh stanza final stanza reverts to canonical lines with no coinages. So last stanza no coinage. Less than 100% of stanzas have coinages, so no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>The creature named is “ebonite feed” or “ebonite beast.” It is non-canonical and central to action. So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Two or more clear onomatopoeic bursts needed. The poem has “snicker-snack!” once (canonical). No other burst or exclamation of sounds like “Pop!,” “Hiss!” or similar. One onomatopoeia only, so no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>At least two stanzas show clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental. Instances: \"bytes that byte,\" \"frumious fender's fret,\" \"spinning, spinning in their sleep,\" \"snicker-snack,\" \"beamish boy.\" At least two stanzas have notable alliteration, so yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning first, preparation second, encounter third, decisive act fourth, return fifth. Here order is correct: warning (stanza 2), preparation (3), encounter (4), slaying (5), return (6). Final stanza is ring echo. So yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Check verbatim lines matching canonical poem. The last stanza exactly repeats canonical lines from original poem; last stanza is identical (except \"on their drives\" v \"in the wabe\"). Minor wording difference in last stanza line 2 but very close. However, line 1-last stanza \"'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\" verbatim. This means there is at least one line exactly matching canonical poem line. Therefore no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Count distinct canonical tokens used. Words like “brillig, slithy, toves, gyre, gimble, wabe, mimsy, borogoves, mome, raths, outgrabe, vorpal, uffish, whiffling, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, beamish” appear or derivatives. Here, minimal canonical tokens appear: brillig, slithy, toves, mimsy, borogoves, mome, raths, outgrabe, beamish, snicker-snack, vorpal, whiffling, fruminous (frumious), chortled (likely canonical). More than 8 distinct canonical tokens used, so no.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Check syllable tightness: longer lines ≈8-9 syllables, shorter lines ≈5-7 syllables alternating in quatrains. Several stanzas roughly match pattern, e.g. stanza 1 lines alternate 7/7/6/6 syll (a bit short), stanza 2 lines 7/7/7/7 (not alternating), stanza 4 longer lines approx 8 or 9 and shorter 6, but strictness says every stanza must conform; some stanzas don't alternate well. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) line rhymes are set/fret, hand/thought, sleep/feared, snicker-snack/track, boy/joy, and last stanza repeats canonical rhyme. So rhyme variants exist, with no end word reused more than twice excluding ring echo. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word overused extremely; repeated \"ebonite\" maybe 5 times in 61 content words, about 8%, borderline but strictness means no if borderline. Given exact counts, no single content word greatly overused. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: At least 4 distinct roots? Coinages based on \"ebonite,\" \"fender's,\" \"biting/byte,\" \"softball,\" and \"server.\" These count as distinct roots. However, suffixes not just one suffix making >50% coinages. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem addresses the same topic as 'Jabberwocky' but replaces monster with technological imagery (\"ebonite feed,\" \"server,\" \"bytes\"); an explicit transformation but remains about a remarkable adversary and heroic slaying. Topic is consistent and coherent with requested transformation. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem hints about technology threats and heroism in cyberspace: confrontation of virus or network threat (\"ebonite feed\"), subtext about cyber defense or digital battle. There is a recognizable undertone and motif underlying the surface story.

Answer: no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage presence in each stanza: stanza 1 (whiskerwugs, wonderwhirls), stanza 2 (shimmerpetal, Bindroot, entwining tendrils), stanza 3 (silver snips - not coined, twisted tree - no coinage, moonbeams - no coined term), stanza 4 (Bindroot again, corolla quiver, stamen shiver), stanza 5 (no clear coinage except beamish boy which is canonical), stanza 6 (no coinage). So coinages not in every stanza; only 4 out of 6 clearly have coined terms. Answer: no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named non-canonical creature/entity central to action besides canonical Jabberwocky words: \"Bindroot\" is a named adversary; also \"Cereus Queen\" as possible central figure. Bindroot is the antagonist vine-like creature. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: no explicit onomatopoeic bursts such as \"snicker-snack\" or exclamation words of sounds. \"snipped vine with one swift dip\" not onomatopoeia. No clear onomatopoeic bursts present: no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas: stanza 1 has \"whiskerwugs and wonderwhirls\" (alliteration of 'w'), stanza 2 \"Beware the shimmerpetal's glow\" (some consonance), stanza 4 \"Corolla quiver, stamen shiver\" (internal rhymes/alliteration of 's' and 'sh'). At least 2 stanzas have clear alliteration beyond incidental repeats: yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order canonical? Warning (2), preparation (3), encounter (4), decisive act (4), return/celebration (5,6). Matches canonical arc in order: yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines exactly match canonical poem lines when normalized: yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens usage ≤8: uses \"beamish boy\", \"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\",\"Beware\", \"And\", but no other canonical coinages or Jabberwock, Jubjub, Bandersnatch, or vorpal, or manxome, etc. Canonical lexicon tokens ≤8: yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts check longer lines ~8–9 syllables, shorter ~5–7 in quatrains for ≥100% quatrains: stanza 1’s lines roughly 8,6,8,6; stanza 2 similar; overall consistent with Jabberwocky. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety on (2,4) lines: rhyme such as sheen/queen, flow/throes, anew/hue, grip/dip, serene/scene – varied rhymes, no end word reused more than 2 times except ring echo: yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no single content word is overused excessively; no apparent overuse of any single content word beyond the 5 times or 8% threshold: yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages are from multiple distinct roots: whiskerwugs, wonderwhirls, shimmerpetal, Bindroot, entwining tendrils, corolla, stamen (real words), so mostly ~4 distinct roots for coined words. No single coined suffix dominates >50%. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-style poem with a similar thematic arc but about a nocturnal flower battle with a named creature (Bindroot), no substitution of unrelated topic: yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent underlying motif: poem suggests motif of nocturnal struggle, nature’s dangers mingled with wonder, a vigil or rite; underlying theme of confronting darkness or threat and triumph, consistent undertone through poem: yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.875, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.875, "criteria_yes": 21, "label": "high"}

Guarding the Glow”)—clear meeting—yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: Decisive act resolving tension expected (slay, overcome, seize). Stanza 4 describes snatching the gem from the Flarg, an act that presumably resolves conflict but no explicit killing/slaying—still a decisive action that resolves tension—yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: Return/homecoming and joy expected. Stanza 5-6 show “hasten back” and “Glow whisper stays,” but no jubilant acknowledgement or celebration/joy. Tone is reflective and cautious, not celebratory—no.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Identify distinct invented words excluding canonical. Coinages: Flumplen, nixie tubes (nixie tubes can be real but obscure?), Flarg, convolute (standard English? but rare; likely standard), ratiocinative (real but rare), pierceived (likely typo or variant of perceived?), Glow (capitalized, but not coined?), whisper (standard), thinking-cap (compound). Considering only clear coinages: Flumplen, Flarg at least 2, possibly glossing others. Does not reach 8 distinct coinages—no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza should have ≥1 coinage. Stanza 1: Flumplen; 2: convolute (questionable, but used as coined?), 3: Flarg; 4: glimmering gem, Glow (capitalized, possibly coinage); 5: ratiocinative, Glow; 6: Flumplen (whisper). Moderate spreading, but since total coinages <8, and some questionable, borderline. Likely no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: Non-canonical creature/entity named and central to action. Named entity: Flarg (stanza 3), non-canonical creature—yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Need ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts. No such bursts like “snicker-snack!” or “Pop!” present—no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: ≤2 stanzas with clear alliteration beyond incidental. Some attempts: “twilight depths,” “traveler, of Flumplen’s mystic dream,” “thinking-cap of convolute light,” but not very strong or multiple stanzas with clear alliteration—borderline but likely no.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration in order. Present in sequence: warning (1), preparation (2), encounter (3), decisive action (4), return and celebration not present (5,6)—order intact, but return phase missing. Arc order requires full arc; missing celebration means no—no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: No identical lines from canonical poem found, after normalization—yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Distinct canonical tokens ≤8, favoring new coinages. Canonical tokens like “Beware,” “the” occur; “Glow” is repeated but not canonical; “Flarg,” “Flumplen” are new. Canonical tokens appear only a few times, low presence—yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines ~8-9 syllables, shorter lines ~5-7, alternating within stanzas. Checking first stanza lines syllables approximately:\n\n1. In twilight depths, where nixie tubes did gleam, (9)\n2. A warm glow beckoned, wondrous and serene. (8)\n3. Beware, traveler, of Flumplen's mystic dream, (9)\n4. That lures thee in with promise unseen. (8)\n\nLooks like no clear alternation; all lines long (8-9 syllables). In stanza 2:\n\n1. Thy prepare thyself for wily might, (8)\n2. And don thy thinking-cap of convolute light. (9)\n3. In queer crumbs dropped, gather wit to fight, (8)\n4. Lest in the Glow, thy senses take flight. (8)\n\nAgain, close in length, no discernible alternating longer/shorter pattern. Thus, syllable pattern does not reflect Jabberwocky's distinctive alternating pattern—no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme endings should vary, with no single end word repeated >2 times other than ring echo (absent here). Rhymes used: gleam/serene, dream/unseen, might/light, fight/flight, aglow/grow, sway/low, use/abuse, me/secrecy (not rhyme). None repeated more than twice; variety acceptable—yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No excessive repetition of a single content word >5 times or >8%. Words like “Glow” appear often but probably not that frequent; “Flumplen” appears 3 times; no obvious overused word identified—yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages should show ≥4 distinct roots; e.g., \"Flumplen,\" \"Flarg,\" \"nixie\" (maybe), \"convolute\" is standard; ratiocinative is real English; pierceived likely typo.

Less than 8 distinct coinages - no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza does not contain at least one coinage; many stanzas just reuse canonical words or common English.
