However, 11 stanzas > 8 max limit, so total stanza count fails. All stanzas have 4 lines, but total stanzas is outside 5–8 inclusive.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter alternation requires lines to alternate longer/shorter with ≥2 content-word difference in ≥60% stanzas. The meter is irregular and syllable counts vary; many stanzas do not clearly alternate line length (many lines are long; not a clear alternating pattern). Probably less than 60% stanzas meet this.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme requires (lines 2,4) rhyme in ≥60% stanzas, avoiding AABB dominance. Here rhyme exists but is weak or inconsistent; rhymes are often slant or near-rhyme (e.g., \"hum\" / \"become\", \"pranced\" / \"danced\"). However, the rhymes (often in couplets (AABB)) dominate; stanzas frequently rhyme 1-2 and 3-4 or 1-2-3-4, showing AABB or perfect couplets, not mostly second and fourth lines (2,4) rhyming or varied pattern. So no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition needs final stanza to echo opening with ≥2 repeated content words or a refrain. The closing stanza echoes \"Beware\" and \"Florapex,\" but not the exact opening. The opening and closing have some repeated words like “vigil,” “cereus,” “lunar,” and “watcher.” But no strong direct ring echo or repeated stanza lines—more thematic echo. <2 common content words repeated. So borderline but strictly no.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present in stanza 2: \"A warning whispered\" and \"Beware, dear heart\" in final stanza. Early warning instructions to protagonist are there, so yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before encounter is present: stanza 3 and 4 describe the watcher preparing (\"don the mantling cloak,\" \"preparation puled,\" \"senses on reveal\"), so yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>The encounter/confrontation is explicit in stanza 5 and 6: \"forth emerged the Florapex\" and watcher stands transfixed, enemy named and described; clear meeting. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive act resolving tension is in stanza 7 and 8: \"burst of tetchy bravado,\" \"gently wound / tender wound,\" \"torpified,\" implying the creature subdued peacefully. So yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration are present in stanza 9,10,11: watcher returns, receives \"coinage earned,\" and gives a warning; suggests triumph and gained wisdom. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Distinct invented words beyond canonical. Examples: cerean, cereus, zingpocket, puled, glimmerglades, umbrous, floopenloops, crikkle, Florapex, fylox, cnorched, semaphored, yaptones, tetchy, fyrax, torpified, auron, auroral. Clearly ≥8 distinct coinages.

Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature named: yes, \"Florapex,\" a non-canonical creature central to the action, distinct from Jabberwock.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: looking for ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts like \"snicker-snack!\" or \"Pop!\" \"Hiss!\" Words like \"crikkle snapped\" can count as onomatopoeia; \"crikkle\" is likely onomatopoeic, \"yaptones\" may imply speech sounds but less clearly onomatopoeic. Only one clear onomatopoeic burst found (\"crikkle snapped\"). Insufficient for two distinct onomatopoeic bursts. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas with clear within-line pattern: examples \"silken threads,\" \"sweet, intoxicating light,\" \"bloomfall, when the cereus’ vigil spreads,\" \"mantling cloak,\" \"floopenloops of self-doubt wildly pranced,\" \"burst of tetchy bravado,\" \"petals fringed,\" \"silken threads of unity,\" \"twined, in that still…,\" \"torpified,\" \"wisdom gained.\" Presence is mild but at least two stanzas display alliteration clearly (e.g., \"silken threads,\" and \"floopenloops... wildly pranced\"). Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (st 2), preparation (st 3), encounter (st 5-6), decisive action (7-8), return/celebration (9-11). Admonition is early; preparation follows; encounter and action follow, concluding with return. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim line from the canonical poem found on normalization and comparison. All unique lines. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexicon tokens are present e.g. \"’Twas brillig,\" \"vorpal\" absent, but \"brillig\" and \"silken\" (not canonical), also some canonical words like \"beware\". Canonical tokens count ≤8 because poem mostly invents coinages; yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines approx. 8–9 syllables, shorter lines 5–7, alternating lines. The meter varies highly; many longer lines significantly exceed 9 syllables (e.g. stanza 1 line 3: 11 syllables). Some stanzas show no clear alternation or approximate syllable counts. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Repeated rhymes 2,4 lines but stanzas mostly AABB or other patterns with reuse of rhymes common; no strong variety; some rhyme words repeat multiple times (e.g. \"might\"/\"light\", \"zeal\"/\"reveal\"). So no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word appears more than 5 times or over 8% of content words, outside ring echo. Words like \"cereus,\" \"watcher,\" \"Florapex\" repeated but not overused. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages come from many distinct roots (crikkle, puled, fylox, semaphored, floopenloops, zingpocket, etc.), no single suffix dominates over 50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem is not about Jabberwocky or Jabberwock but about a named new creature \"Florapex\" and a vigil involving a flower and watcher.

The poem's stanzas have varying line counts: first two are quatrains (4 lines), third stanza has 4 lines, fourth and fifth have 4 lines; sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth stanzas have 4 lines mostly except last stanza seems to have 4 lines. So all stanzas appear to have 4 lines. Count carefully for stanza count: 9 stanzas, which is outside 5–8 inclusive requirement, so fails stanza count criterion.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter requires line length alternation (long/short lines alternating) with ≥2 content word difference in ≥60% of stanzas. Lines appear relatively uniform in length with little clear alternation. Most stanzas do not show obvious alternating longer/shorter line pattern with clear content word difference. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Analyze rhyme (2,4) for stanzas: e.g., stanza 1 lines 2 (\"play\") and 4 (\"day\") rhyme clearly. Stanza 2 lines 2 (\"engage\") and 4 (\"stage\") rhyme well. Stanza 3 lines 2 (\"might\") and 4 (\"night\") rhyme, and so on. Rhyme seems consistently (2,4) rhymed for ≥60% stanzas. Also avoid AABB pattern dominance; stanzas have ABCB rhyme pattern typical of ballads. So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes the opening stanza's theme of \"Pantograph's Azure Sway\" and workshop \"secret lies,\" but no direct repeated content words or clear phrase refrain from the first stanza. Weak or absent ring composition with at least 2 repeated content words/phrases. So no.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>An early admonition: stanza 3 includes \"Beware the snick of faulty might / That doth imperil the azure light,\" which is a warning to the protagonist. So yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: stanza 3 references preparation \"Prepare thyself with calipers bright,\" which is a tool and resolve prep before encounter; yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: stanza 4 depicts the clear meeting with \"A Glintzen, creature of sparks, did seem / To dance...\" so yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: stanza 5 \"I grasped the handle, firm and tight / And steadied the pantograph's wild flight\" indicates a resolute, decisive act to resolve the tension; yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: stanza 6, \"Through trials and errors, I did stray / Yet returned, wiser… / The pantograph’s song…\", a return and positive resolution. Also, stanza 7 expresses joy with words like \"a joyous bound.\" So yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented coinages: pantograph, brillig (canonical), frumious (canonical), snick (borderline), Glintzen, Zortle, Glimmerwings, Friznells, azure (standard), fizzing (standard), sway (standard), etc. Excluding canonical from reference and standard English, found: pantograph, snick, Glintzen, Zortle, Glimmerwings, Friznells — 6 distinct coinages approx. Less than 8 required, so no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Does each stanza contain at least one coinage? First stanza: \"pantograph,\" \"brillig\" (canonical); second stanza: \"frumious,\" \"gyroscopic\" (standard), \"pantograph\"; third stanza: \"snick\"; fourth stanza: \"Glintzen,\" \"Zortle\"; fifth stanza none obvious except pantograph; sixth stanza none; seventh stanza \"Glimmerwings,\" \"Friznells\"; eighth stanza \"pantograph\"; ninth stanza \"pantograph.\" Not every stanza definitively contains a coinage. So no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central apart from Jabberwock: Yes, \"Glintzen\" is a named creature and central in encounter. Also mentions \"Zortle’s scream,\" \"Glimmerwings,\" \"Friznells\"—creature or phenomena. So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"snick\" (snick of faulty might), \"fizzing\" sound, \"Zortle's scream\" (somewhat onomatopoeic). At least two audible bursts implied. So yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: stanza 1 \"workshop's haze / pantograph arcing blue,\" some consonance; stanza 2 \"frumious care,\" \"gyroscopic wheels\"; stanza 4 \"foe he sought,\" \"stood awhile in thought\" is canonical; here \"Glintzen, creature of sparks,\" \"fizzing sound,\" \"Zortle's scream\" shows multiple consonances; at least two stanzas show clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza 3 with warning), preparation (stanza 3), encounter (stanza 4), decisive act (stanza 5), return/celebration (stanza 6 and 7); arc proceeds in canonical order yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No exact line matches the canonical reference poem, after normalization. All original lines. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens: poem includes brillig, frumious (canonical), and some canonical lexicon like pantograph (non-canonical). Canonical tokens count ≤8: brillig, frumious, gyroscopic (no), so mostly few canonical tokens used. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Jabberwocky alternates longer (~8–9 syll) and shorter (~5–7) lines per quatrain stanza. This poem's lines generally uniform in length, more like 8–10 syll each, little shorter-longer alternation. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: stanza rhymes (2,4) vary: \"play/day,\" \"engage/stage,\" \"might/night,\" \"seem/dream,\" \"tight/light,\" \"stray/may,\" \"sound/round,\" \"lies/guise/prize\" show varied rhyme sets, no end word reused >2 times except minor echo. So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no single content word seems overused. \"pantograph\" appears multiple times but not excessively (>5 times or 8% content words). So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: have multiple distinct roots: pantograph, Glintzen, Zortle, Glimmerwings, Friznells, snick, etc. At least 4 distinct roots with no single suffix dominating. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem clearly addresses topic of a \"pantograph\" and arc/light experiment metaphor with creature and action, mapping to the given task (stylistic imitation of Jabberwocky with some new theme). So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Final stanza hints at \"a secret lies,\" \"innovation, art, and surprise,\" indicating a motif of creativity and struggle beyond surface action. So yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.75, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.75, "criteria_yes": 18, "label": "medium"}

Actually, confirmed 10 stanzas all 4 lines each. Total stanza count is 10, which exceeds max 8 – no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter alternation requires ≥60% stanzas with alternate longer/shorter lines ≥2 content words difference: trying to estimate. Lines vary in length but not strongly alternating in most stanzas; longer lines about 8–9 syllables mostly, shorter lines less common; alternation pattern weak or inconsistent – no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyming pattern in most stanzas: often lines 2 and 4 rhyme or slant rhyme - e.g. \"pace/start\", \"awry/last\", \"fine/amaze\". However, some stanzas have weak rhyme or no clear rhyme. Also check for AABB dominance - no full AABB dominant pattern but some partial pairs. At least 6/10 stanzas seem to have some rhyme (2,4) - borderline but not >60% with reliable rhyme. Given partial slant rhyme, cautious – no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: last stanza echoes the first stanza with at least two content words or a clear refrain? Last stanza repeats the phrase \"’twas in a whirlybird's whizzing space\", similar to first line. That's a clear ring echo with repeated phrase; meets requirement – yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition/warning: stanza 5 contains “Beware, dear hands, of blued screw’s might” – clear admonition – yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: next line of stanza 5 says “Prepare your tools, and take a stand”, clear preparation before encounter – yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: stanza 7 describes “encounter met the engineer’s glee” and “A socket wrench... did grip the blued screw” – clearly encounter – yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: stanza 8 details “decisive twist” that slows maddening reveal, implying resolution – yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: poem ends with peace creeping in and “sound of silence,” no explicit jubilant return or celebration, no welcoming lines like “come to my arms” or joyful chortle; this is more subdued ending – no.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: coined words include \"flibberflam\", \"whirlybird\", \"snickled\", \"scroodled\", \"aximo\", \"zoops\", \"bloofed\", \"whoomled\", \"thrum\", \"whizzing\" (arguably common), \"sortled\", \"klabbering\". At least 8 distinct coined words beyond standard English or canonical – yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza contains at least one coinage: yes, most stanzas have at least one coined word. For example, “flibberflam”, “snickled”, “scroodled”, “aximo”, “zoops”, “bloofed”, “whoomled”. All stanzas except maybe stanza 5, which has “blued screw” and “whirlybird” repeated; those are coinages. So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central to action: “blued screw” presented as antagonist; “whirlybird” appears as vehicle/context. “Blued screw” is not canonical and is central – yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: poem has “burble” (burbled is canonical, here “burbled”) and “snickled” (coinage but ambiguous), “scroodled”, “whoomled”—unclear if these are onomatopoeic bursts. No explicit exclamations like “snicker-snack!” or “Pop!”, “Hiss!”, so probably fewer than 2 clear onomatopoeic bursts – no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: multiple stanzas show alliteration e.g. “whirlybird’s whizzing wings,” “blued screw spun with frenzied pace.” At least two stanzas show strong alliteration – yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza5) → preparation (stanza5) → encounter (stanza7) → decisive action (stanza8) → return/celebration (stanza9/10). Return/celebration is subdued but peace suggested, arc mostly in correct order – yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: no exact line matches from Jabberwocky poem visible; all lines differ significantly – yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token usage ≤8: poem includes “frumious” and “burble(d)”, not many other canonical tokens; only “frumious” and “burble(d)” clearly from canonical lexicon; total canonical tokens ≤8 - yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines mostly around 8-9 syllables, shorter lines about 5-7 in most quatrains. Some lines a bit irregular (e.g. stanza with 10 syllables), but mostly fits tight syllable count pattern – yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: rhyme pairs vary between stanzas, no repeated exact end rhymes >2 times, excluding ring echo phrase – yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: “blued screw” repeated but less than 5 times or 8% of content words. No excessive repetition of any single content word – yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages from multiple distinct roots: “flibberflam”, “snickled”, “scroodled”, “aximo”, “zoops”, “bloofed”, “whoomled”, “thrum”, “sortled”, “klabbering” – diverse roots well spread, no single suffix dominates – yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly addresses the topic of a “blued screw” (mechanical antagonist or enemy) like Jabberwocky’s creature; no drifting to unrelated subjects – yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: beyond surface action, poem metaphorically suggests the struggle between tool/engineer and chaotic mechanics, hints at control/order motif; gentle peace replaces battle; consistent implied reflection – yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.7916666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.7916666666666666, "criteria_yes": 19, "label": "medium"}

Total stanza count is 5, which is within 5-8 inclusive. All are quatrains.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Check ballad meter: lines alternate longer/shorter with at least 2 content words difference in ≥60% stanzas? Some stanzas have lines of variable length but meter is uneven and not tightly alternating with required difference. Less than 3 of 5 stanzas clearly show alternating long/short pattern with this strictness.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme with (2,4) rhymes and avoid AABB dominance: Rhyme is inconsistent and weak. Some slant rhyme attempts (hum / drum), (boom / swoon), (swarm / form), (sound / around). These pairs rhyme in (2,4) lines mostly. No AABB dominance as no couplets formed. Rhyme in at least 3 of 5 stanzas (60%) present, so yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Final stanza repeats ≥2 content words/phrases from opening or has clear refrain. Opening stanza mentions \"tulgey dells,\" \"orin bells,\" \"whiffling wights,\" \"galumphing heart.\" Final stanza mentions \"orin bell,\" \"tulgey dells,\" and \"somnolent chime.\" Words like \"orin bell,\" \"tulgey dells\" repeated effectively. So ≥2 repeated content words/phrases are present.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning or admonition early: No explicit early admonition or \"Beware\" type caution is present. The poem observes and prepares but no direct admonition or warning line is detected.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before encounter: The protagonist \"readied self,\" \"steeled my nerves,\" and \"grasped the clapper,\" indicating preparation before the encounter with the bell.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter/confrontation: The poem describes the protagonist approaching and striking the orin bell, causing creatures to appear. This is the encounter/confrontation.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive slaying or action resolving tension: The central action is striking the bell with \"flumplenooks\" and the cessation of the hum. This seems to be the decisive action resolving the tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return homecoming/celebration: The poem ends with the protagonist turning to leave, with the \"tulgey dells ... echoed all around,\" but no jubilant or celebratory acknowledgment is given. Return without celebration.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Distinct invented coinages: Coinages include orin, flumplenooks, whiffling, galumphing (canonical), aflum, whum-whum, borogrove (canonical), somnolent chime (somnolent standard English but used poetically). Overall about 5-6 new coinages clearly invented (\"orin,\" \"flumplenooks,\" \"aflum,\" \"whum-whum,\" \"wights\" as non-canonical?), fewer than 8 distinct new coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Not all stanzas contain an invented coinage. For example, stanza 5 includes \"whum-whum,\" \"orin bell,\" and \"somnolent chime.\" Most stanzas have at least one coinage or semi-coinage, so meets the criterion.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named non-canonical creature/entity central (not Jabberwock): \"Orin bell\" is an entity, not a creature, but it is central. Additionally, creatures appear in stanza 4 (\"creatures ... whiffling swarm,\" \"borogroves\" is canonical). The new entity is the \"orin bell\" which is central to action. No other non-canonical creature named. So yes, \"orin bell\" is an entity named and central.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: No clear onomatopoeic bursts like 'snicker-snack', 'pop!', 'hiss!' present. Words like \"hum,\" \"thrumming,\" and \"whum-whum\" may suggest sounds but not clear bursts or exclamations recognized as onomatopoeia.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance ≥2 stanzas: Some internal alliteration such as \"whiffling wights,\" \"flumplenooks,\" \"swooping swoon,\" but overall minimal and not clearly in ≥2 stanzas beyond incidental. Possibly one stanza with alliteration but not two clearly distinct ones.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning (No), Preparation (Yes), Encounter (Yes), Decisive act (Yes), Return (Yes but no celebration).

Original lines all different.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens ≤8: Contains canonical words from reference: \"tulgey,\" \"whiffling,\" \"galumphing,\" \"borogrove,\" \"mome\" (mome-like), the thousand canonical words used sparingly, probably ≤8 distinct canonical tokens used. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines around 8-9 syllables and shorter around 5-7? Lines vary; for example, stanza 1 lines syllable counts approximately: 8, 7, 7, 7. Stanza 3 first line \"The orin bell, a borogrove deep\" ~8 syllables. Syllable count is approximate but mostly fits tightness, so yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes mostly different across stanzas with \"hum/drum,\" \"boom/swoon,\" \"swarm/form,\" \"sound/around.\" No reuse of exact rhyme words >2 times excluding ring. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overused excessively. Vocabulary is diverse and repetition low.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages vary (orin, aflum, flumplenooks, whum-whum, wights could count). No single suffix dominates. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem focuses on exploration and confrontation with the \"orin bell\" in \"tulgey dells,\" a similar fantastic setting as Jabberwocky but shifted subject. Since topic is not explicitly given, assuming topic is related to fantastical entities like Jabberwocky, this poem does address a mythical encounter with a named entity similar in style. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied layer: The poem evokes themes of facing unknown mysterious forces, preparation for challenge, and the tranquility after struggle suggesting undertones of bravery and contemplation.

Title is non-empty and separated.</C1_think>\n<C2_think>Stanzas count 8; all stanzas have 4 lines. Meets quatrain count and stanza count requirement.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter check: In many stanzas, line lengths alternate roughly longer/shorter with ≥2 content words difference (e.g., longer lines with more content words, shorter lines less). This pattern holds in at least 5 of 8 stanzas, so meets ≥60% criterion.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme pattern: Most stanzas rhyme lines 2 and 4. Examples: \"reside/inside,\" \"prepare/air,\" \"kind/find,\" \"stride/divide,\" and so on. No AABB dominance as the rhyme is consistently in (2,4). So ≥60% stanzas rhyme (2,4) with no AABB overuse.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza echoes the first stanza's content with shared phrases (\"Brockle Snareglow,\" \"twilight burrows,\" \"reside\"), effectively a ring composition with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition: In stanza 1 line 4, \"Beware, traveler, of this snare inside.\" This is a warning similar to Lewis Carroll's 'Beware' admonition.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before encounter: Stanza 2 shows badgers preparing with \"With flixle spades, the badgers prepare,\" indicating preparation before action.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: Stanza 3 mentions the traveler encountering \"Hriskle, badger kind,\" plus warning of the adversary \"Glintleg.\" Clear meeting with adversary's presence.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive act: Stanza 4 shows the traveler acting decisively: \"grasps the knot,\" and \"Zortle snaps,\" with lines suggesting breaking apart or resolving the obstacle.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Final stanzas (6-8) depict a return with wisdom gained and lessons learned, the path shining, and badgers residing peacefully. A clear return and positive acknowledgment.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count invented coinages: \"Brockle,\" \"Snareglow,\" \"flixle,\" \"gromble,\" \"wuggle,\" \"krizzle,\" \"zortle,\" \"floopen,\" \"flibloom,\" \"glimmering,\" \"twine\" (though some words like glimmering and twine might be English). At least 8 clear invented coinages present.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinages spread: Each stanza contains at least one coinage word. For example: stanza 1 (\"Brockle Snareglow\"), stanza 2 (\"flixle,\" \"gromble,\" \"wuggle\"), stanza 3 (\"Hriskle,\" \"krizzle,\" \"Glintleg\"), stanza 4 (\"zortle,\" \"floopen\"), stanza 5 (\"brockle\"), stanza 6 (\"twine\"), stanza 7 (\"glimmering\"), stanza 8 (\"Brockle Snareglow\"). All stanzas have coinages.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: \"Hriskle,\" described as badger kind, is named and central to the action and narrative. Also \"Glintleg,\" presumably a dangerous entity, is another named creature involved.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: No explicit onomatopoeic bursts like \"snicker-snack\" or \"Pop! Hiss!\" found. Words like \"zortle snaps\" suggest sound but are not clear onomatopoeia. So fewer than 2 clear onomatopoeia bursts.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Multiple stanzas show within-line alliteration or consonance such as stanza 2 \"Gromble sounds, and wuggle whispers,\" stanza 3 \"Krizzle eyes,\" stanza 4 \"floopen strings,\" stanza 5 \"brockle snare,\" etc. At least 2 stanzas with clear alliteration/consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The poem follows canonical arc order - warning (stanza 1), preparation (2), encounter (3), decisive act (4), then return/celebration (6-8). Order preserved.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines from Carroll's canonical poem detected. All lines are original phrasing.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexicon usage: No obvious canonical tokens from Carroll's poem (e.g., brillig, slithy, toves) used. Canonical tokens ≤8, likely zero here; thus favors new coinages.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines mostly around 8-9 syllables; shorter lines about 5-7. For example, in stanza 1 lines: \"In twilight burrows, deep and wide,\" (7 syllables? maybe 8) vs \"Badger knot bloom doth start to reside,\" (8 syllables). Pattern holds consistently across stanzas.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme pairs vary across stanzas: reside/inside, prepare/air, kind/find, stride/divide, wide/deride, tide/hide, shine/entwine, reside/hide. No exact end word reused more than twice. Good variety.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word overused above 5 times or 8% of content words. The word \"badger\" appears several times but under frequency thresholds.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages have multiple distinct roots (\"Brockle,\" \"Snareglow,\" \"flixle,\" \"gromble,\" \"wuggle,\" \"Hriskle,\" \"krizzle,\" \"Glintleg,\" \"zortle,\" \"floopen,\" \"flibloom\"). More than 4 distinct roots, no single suffix dominates.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem addresses a creature/adversary-centered adventure involving a badger creature and a snare, which fits the Jabberwocky-style invented creature confrontation topic without substitution.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is an implied subtext of overcoming dangers and learning wisdom (warning, preparation, courage, triumph, and return with lessons).

So not all stanzas have coinages; probably 6/8 have at least one coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: \"gleebs,\" \"snicks\" appear as adversaries or entities; \"snitches\" possibly less so; \"krenovian plane\" is location or entity. \"gleebs\" and \"snicks\" are creatures in action. Clearly central adversaries other than Jabberwock.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: examples like \"snicker-snack\" canonical; here, words like \"shriek\" repeated, but is \"shriek\" onomatopoeia or standard word? The poem uses no obvious onomatopoeic bursts or excitable bursts (e.g. “Pop!”, “Snicker-snack!”). So no distinct onomatopoeia bursts detected.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: stanza 1 “krenovian plane's,” “throaty scream”; stanza 2 “frumious winds,” “whisper low,” stanza 3 \"galimatias grips,\" \"grasped my shriek,\" stanza 4 \"did silence,\" \"did stab\" (not present), generally some consonance and alliteration. More than 2 stanzas with visible alliteration/consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza 1), preparation (2), encounter (3), decisive act (4), return/celebration (6-8). The arc beats happen in canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: no line matches reference poem line exactly; wording is original.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens usage: \"frumious\" is from canonical but used only once; no \"vorpal,\" \"slithy,\" etc. Canonical lexicon tokens ≤8 (only \"frumious\" clearly). No overuse of canonical tokens.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines ~8–9 syllables, shorter lines ~5–7. Scan a few stanzas: stanza 1 lines approx 7,7,7,7 or 8; lacks clear alternating pattern. No clear or consistent ballad-like meter; borderline, likely no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme varies (\"sway\"/\"may,\" \"know\"/\"woe,\" \"speak\"/\"shriek,\" \"might\"/\"flight,\" \"back\"/\"track,\" \"bite\"/\"night,\" \"alight\"/\"sight,\" \"sleep\"/\"creep,\" \"deep\"/\"keep\"). Some repeated (e.g., sight/alight), but appears to keep variety >2. Likely yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: no single content word appears overused; words like “shriek” 4 times might approach limits but unlikely >5 times or 8%. Distribution appears fine.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages include \"krenovian,\" \"gleebs,\" \"snicks,\" \"snatches,\" \"galimatias,\" \"glimbled,\" at least 4 distinct roots; coinage suffix repetition low. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a confrontation with a creature-like adversary (\"gleebs,\" \"snicks\") in a strange place (\"krenovian plane\") mirroring the style of Jabberwocky; theme consistent and no topic shift.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext present: The poem implies a journey through danger and battle leading to peace and understanding, a motif of overcoming fear, a subtle undertone beyond surface narrative.

Estimated at least 8 distinct coinages but some onomatopoeia are standard. So borderline, but can say yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Not every stanza clearly has at least 1 coinage; Snurflot appears central but mostly in stanzas 4, 6 and 9; \"Glint\" appears few times; onomatopoeia are primary coinages scattered in stanzas 2, 4, 6, 7.

No direct warning like \"Beware\" or similar admonition in first or second stanza. No caution to protagonist found. No.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Does protagonist prepare before encounter? In second stanza, lifting cup carefully, savoring aroma — this can be regarded as a quiet preparation or ritual before the \"creature\" visit. The pause and savoring indicate some preparation, so yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Is there a clear encounter with a creature or adversary? Third stanza introduces a \"curious creature\" with \"furry feet and eyes that twinkled,\" which interacts by sipping tea and vanishing. So yes, there is a clear encounter with a named creature (\"creature\").</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Is there a decisive act resolving tension? The poem lacks any clear conflict or killing/slaying; the encounter is brief and peaceful, ending with the creature vanishing. No violence or decisive action occurs. So no.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Is there a return and celebration? The poem ends peacefully with the traveler enlightened and strolling in the world, but no jubilant celebration or return home theme. This is more reflective than celebratory. So no.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented coinages (not canonical or standard English). Coinages present include: \"Kyusu\" (Japanese teapot), \"glip\" (onomatopoeic?), \"zhrak\" (steam sound?), \"whisk\" (standard English, exclude), \"brillig\" (canonical), \"twinkled\" (English), \"astringent\" (English). Only \"kyusu,\" \"glip,\" and \"zhrak\" stand out as coinages. Count is clearly less than 8. So no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Does each stanza contain at least one coinage? Only stanzas 1 and 3 contain coinages (\"kyusu,\" \"glip\"), stanza 6 includes \"zhrak.\" Others mostly standard English words. So less than all. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Is a non-canonical creature/entity named and central? Creature is introduced but not named with a specific invented name — called only “a curious creature” with furry feet and twinkling eyes, no unique coined name. Not canonical Jabberwock or known canonical character. So no.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Are there ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts? \"Glip\" and \"zhrak\" are possible onomatopoeic bursts; \"glip\" as a happy sound and \"zhrak\" as steam sound.

Some alliteration attempts like \"sip the bitter wisdom\" and \"soft whoosh and steam's gentle sway,\" but these are not strong nor prominent across multiple stanzas. At most one or two mild instances. This is borderline but likely no because it’s not clearly strong or multiple. No.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: canonical order is warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return. Here, no warning. Preparation present (stanza 2), then encounter (3), then no decisive action (no slaying), no return celebration, but reflective stroll (possible return). Missing warning and decisive act. So arc only partially present, but canonical order as strict? No.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Are there any verbatim lines from canonical poem? No lines exactly match canonical poem. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens ≤8? \"Brillig\" is used (canonical), no other canonical creatures or coinages appear. Only one canonical token \"brillig.\" So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Are syllable counts close to Jabberwocky's pattern (~8–9 syllables for longer lines, ~5–7 for shorter)? Lines mostly exceed 8 syllables, with few shorter lines below 7. The pattern of alternating longer and shorter lines is absent. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: the rhymes (2,4) are varied with no more than 2 repetitions of the same rhyme word across stanzas—different words: play/sway, rip/dip, swayed/glip, unfold/stroll, creep/seep, keep/deep. So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No overuse of single content words: no content word over 5 uses or 8% apparent. Words are varied. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety ≥4 distinct roots? Only 3 coinages total (kyusu, glip, zhrak). Not enough roots or coinages to meet variety requirement. So no.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem addresses a tea-related theme with a mysterious creature, evoking the Jabberwocky style but with tea setting instead of Jabberwock and nonsense coinages. So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Is there a coherent subtext or motif beyond surface action? The poem hints at a mystical, reflective experience with tea and an elusive creature, with notions of mystery, secrecy, and enlightenment.

does not meet 5 to 8 stanzas all of 4 lines each.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter echo: Lines do not clearly alternate long and short lines with ≥2 content-word difference in 60% of stanzas; meter is irregular and varied.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme: Rhyme scheme is mostly irregular; few stanzas have (2,4) rhyme and no clear avoidance of AABB dominance; rhyme is weak or absent in many.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Final stanza does not clearly echo opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words or a refrain.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning admonition: Early stanzas contain warning by the Photoflare and advice to don shades; an admonition-like caution is clearly present.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation armament: There is mention of \"don the shades\" and \"prepare for the stroke,\" indicating preparation before confrontation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter confrontation: There is a description of approach and encounter with the \"Furnacewyrm,\" the adversary creature; a clear confrontation exists.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying decisive action: The decisive act is less clear; the \"stir the burning deep\" and \"image fixed\" indicate resolution but not a classic slaying action; more subtle and less clear.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return celebration: There is no jubilant or triumphant homecoming or return; poem ends with cautious respect, no celebration or joy.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: At least 8 distinct coined words present including Flickerflame, Photoflare, Furnacewyrm, Sparklesnaps, Flickerfork, Thunderrip, Glintwraithe, Sizzlecrack, Fimbulwinter, Softsigh, Fracture, Flickerflame (repeated); exceeds 8 distinct coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Nearly every stanza contains at least one coined word; coinages are well distributed throughout.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: \"Furnacewyrm\" and \"Glintwraithe\" are non-canonical creatures named and central to action; yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"Sparklesnaps,\" \"sizzle,\" \"Thunderrip,\" and \"Sizzlecrack\" evoke onomatopoeic bursts; more than two onomatopoeic bursts present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration consonance: Several stanzas contain noticeable alliteration e.g. \"Flickerfork,\" \"fiery coils,\" \"sizzle,\" \"smoldering space,\" \"Softsigh,\" \"sparklesnaps\"; at least two stanzas clearly show this device.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The poem broadly follows the order warning → preparation → encounter → decisive action (image fixed) → no clear return/celebration (ends with caution); arc largely in canonical order but missing celebratory return.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: No exact matches to canonical poem lines; phrasing is original.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Very few canonical lexicon tokens appear (none of the canonical Jabberwocky lexemes are used); canonical tokens ≤8 (likely zero).</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Lines vary in length, sometimes longer than 9 syllables or shorter than 5 syllables; no consistent ~8/6 syllable rhythm as in Jabberwocky quatrains; syllable pattern irregular.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: End rhymes show low variety and inconsistent rhyme; some end rhymes repeated frequently; no clear variety in stanza rhymes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No content word seems overused to excess; words like \"flame,\" \"burning,\" \"warning\" appear moderately; no word crosses 5 times or 8% content words.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages have diverse roots, no single suffix dominates; at least four distinct roots (flicker-, photo-, furnace-, sizzle-, thunder-, glint-, soft-, fracture-); variety present.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem addresses a new subject: a dangerous enlarger and a 'Furnacewyrm'—not the Jabberwock or related canonical creatures; different subject but stylistic homage; topic not the canonical Jabberwock, but within the spirit of the poem (fantastical creature and duel). Since no explicit topic was provided, partial adherence to the theme of a fantastic creature encounter is present.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: An implied cautionary motif about respect for dangerous forces (art/technology), and careful preparation and respect for power; subtext is coherent across poem.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.625, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.625, "criteria_yes": 15, "label": "medium"}
