This is 6/6 = 100%. No dominant AABB pattern as quatrains are mostly ABAB or ABAB-like.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza repeats content words/phrases from opening stanza: \"In ebonite feed heat-set hour\" repeats exactly twice (first and last stanza). This is a clear ring composition echo.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition: first stanza includes \"Beware the frotch of gloamy fray,\" issuing a direct warning to the protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: second stanza describes \"quester hears a clanging,\" \"He dons burnglove and glassjacket dank / And grips a flameforger’s zeal.\" Clear preparation before confrontation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation is clearly described in stanza 3 and 4 with the frosted shape of \"spindleshade\" appearing and attacking, and the fight follows.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive act present: stanza 4 describes the attack and defeat with \"He lunged with flamestitch beam in hand / And smote the frotch,\" and the adversary \"borked and spurted.\" This resolves the central tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: the final stanza shows homecoming and joy, \"Now home he strides with ringing cheer / His burden light, his purpose clear / The realm revived,\" indicating a celebratory return.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Counted distinct invented coinages: ebonite, frotch, gloamy, wompish, quester (borderline English but archaic/rare), burnglove, glassjacket, flameforger, spindleshade, hissed a sizz (onomatopoeic but here more phrase), crackle (standard English), borked, spurfire-brand, brizzle-blood, scorch-spray — at least 9 distinct coinages (excluding standard words). So yes ≥8.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage: e.g., stanza 1: ebonite, frotch, gloamy, wompish; stanza 2: burnglove, glassjacket, flameforger; stanza 3: spindleshade; stanza 4: borked, brimzzle-blood, spurfire-brand, scorch-spray; stanza 5: no clear coinage (words like \"ringing cheer\", \"burden light\" are standard); stanza 6: \"ebonite feed heat-set hour\" repeated but \"ebonite\" is coinage. So stanza 5 may lack coinage–uncertain. Conservative answer: no (since 5th stanza has no clear coinage).</C12_think>\n<C13_think>A non-canonical creature is named: \"frotch,\" which is central to action (antagonist). The \"spindleshade\" is also mentioned as \"frosted shape\" but may be description or separate entity; the main adversary is \"frotch.\" So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts: \"hissed a sizz,\" \"crackle leapt\" appear but are subtle, not strong bursts or exclamations like \"snicker-snack\" or \"Pop!\"; onomatopoeia count is borderline. There are arguably 2 onomatopoeic sounds (\"hiss\" and \"crackle\"), but no burst words with punctuation or exclamation. Conservative: yes, 2 counts but weak.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance clearly in multiple stanzas: e.g., stanza 1 \"feed...frotch...fray,\" stanza 2 \"quester...clanging...clanging...clanging,\" stanza 4 \"flamestitch...flame...frotch...spurfire-brand,\" stanza 5 \"strides...ringing,\" etc. At least 2 stanzas with clear alliteration/consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order is canonical: warning (1st stanza) → preparation (2nd stanza) → encounter (3rd stanza) → decisive act (4th stanza) → return/celebration (5th and 6th stanza). Correct order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines exactly match the canonical poem when normalizing quotes, dashes, or whitespace; all lines are original.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used: \"Beware,\" \"jaws,\" \"bite\" (not in poem), \"long\" (not in poem), \"stood\" (not in poem), maybe some functional words, but canonical poem's special lexemes (brillig, slithy, toves, gyre, gimble, wabe, mimsy, borogoves, mome, raths, outgrabe, Jubjub, Bandersnatch, vorpal, manxome, Tumtum, uffish, whiffling, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish) are absent or nearly so; only \"beware\" is canonical, so yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: In each stanza, longer lines approx. 8-9 syllables, shorter lines 5-7. Quick scan: stanza 1 lines ≈7,7,7,6 syllables (short overall), stanza 2 lines closer to 7-8, stanza 3 possibly close to pattern; uneven but mostly fits. Some lines slightly short, but overall close enough. Conservative: yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme varies per stanza with \"fray/day,\" \"steel/zeal,\" \"spindleshade/blade,\" \"hand/brand,\" \"cheer/clear,\" \"bower/hour.\" All differ, no reuse over 2 times; yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: no single content word overused >5 times or 8% of content words.

Set blorp-emblems... prime your glint of flanger dream\"), clearly preparation before encounter, so yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: Third stanza describes the Spaghettron coils awakening (\"Spaghettron coils in snarl and hiss... twisty sinews wake\") which is the confrontation setup; stanza 4 depicts the active battle (\"madness-spikes phase amassed... You thrust the crystal burn at last\"), so yes, clear encounter.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: Fourth stanza includes decisive action (\"You thrust the crystal burn at last, And banish’d twist of snaky name\"), clearly resolving tension, so yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Fifth stanza depicts return (\"Home bled your foot through glimmered glade,\" \"Your signals hum in triumph clear\"), jubilant tone, no patch or coil haunting, so yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Count of invented coinages not standard English or canonical. Examples: \"tangle-skein,\" \"snafgle-knots,\" \"blorp-emblems,\" \"flanger dream,\" \"Spaghettron,\" \"birftle-riffs,\" \"madness-spikes,\" \"crystal burn,\" \"glimmered glade,\" \"signal hum\" (signal is English but more concrete?), maybe 8 distinct coined terms at least. Some compounds, but overall likely ≥8 distinct coinages, so yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza appears to contain at least one coinage (see examples under C11). Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: A non-canonical creature/entity named and central: \"Spaghettron\" is named and is adversary; so yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Look for onomatopoeic bursts or sounds (like \"snicker-snack\"). The poem uses words like \"hiss\" but that's standard English, no bursts like \"Pop!\" or repeated sounds. No clear onomatopoeia bursts as in original, so no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Are at least 2 stanzas showing within-line alliteration? Examples: \"Take up your knobs and crank the key, Strike sound-dial thrums in timbral gleam\" has alliteration (knobs/crank/key, strike/sound), and stanza 3 \"Spaghettron coils in snarl and hiss\" (some internal consonance). Probably yes for 2 stanzas.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The plot follows the canonical order: admonition → preparation → encounter → decisive action → return/celebration in proper sequence, so yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: The poem uses no exact lines from the canonical poem; wording is original and none verbatim match, so yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Canonical tokens like \"brillig\", \"slithy\" etc. are zero here. No canonical words used; well under ≤8; so yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines ~8-9 syllables, shorter lines ~5-7 syllables. Counting examples:  \nLine 1 stanza 1: Beware the patch of tangle-skein, (8 syll)  \nLine 2 stanza 1: Where sinewy cables writhe and coil, (8 syll)  \nLine 3 stanza 1: And snafgle-knots in neon rain (7)  \nLine 4 stanza 1: Will steal the spark of each bold toiler. (9?)  \nPattern not strict alternation but mostly lines near 7-9 syll; not strict shorter/longer alternation with 8/6 typical pattern. Probably no for strict handling.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme pairs are: coil/rain; gleam/dream; hiss/bliss; flame/name; clear/fear; slow/glow. No ending repeated more than twice ignoring ring echo. So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word overused; words like \"patch,\" \"coil,\" appear a few times but well under thresholds, so yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages derive from diverse roots: \"tangle-\", \"snafgle-\", \"blorp-\", \"flanger\", \"Spaghettron,\" \"birftle-\", \"madness-spikes,\" \"crystal burn,\" etc. No obvious dominant suffix accounting for >50%. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem addresses a styled adventure involving a \"patch\" with tangled cables and an adversary \"Spaghettron,\" clearly analogous to a creature-adventure, matching the stylistic topic (Jabberwocky-type poem about a foe). So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond surface action, the poem evokes themes of technological struggle, mastering chaos, and reclamation of control. The undertone of human ingenuity vs tangled complication is coherent, so yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.875, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.875, "criteria_yes": 21, "label": "high"}
