The third cone kissed the floor—  \nAn emerald sliver, bent, no more.  \nHe plunged the lever! Hissed the flame,  \nAs steam-voles scuttled through the door.  \n\nThe roar withdrew, the wards unbent,  \nThe chamber cooled, the world repent.  \nHe trundled out the stoneware prize—  \nNo flaw, no crack, his craft well spent.  \n\nBeware the Kiln, with quiver and sigh,  \nIts throat now dim beneath the sky.  \nThe cones stand straight in ashes white—  \nAnd men still watch where firings fly.", "info": {"topic": "kiln witness cone bend"}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>Title line \"**The Glazier’s Vigil**\" is present and non-empty before stanzas.</C1_think>\n<C2_think>8 stanzas total; all appear to have 4 lines each; stanza count is between 5 and 8; all quatrains.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Checking line length alternation in stanzas: line lengths fit pattern of longer/shorter alternation in most stanzas (e.g., stanza 1 lines alternate between roughly 8–9 and 5–7 syllables); at least 5 of 8 stanzas show this pattern, so ≥60% met.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme in lines (2,4) across stanzas: most stanzas rhyme (e.g. prayer/yawn in stanza 1 is slant rhyme? less clear; stanza 2 rhyme: keep/eye no rhyme; stanza 3: Snap/flap rhyme, crawl/lap rhyme proper; stanza 4: hand/band rhyme; stanza 5: bow/aglow rhyme; stanza 6: floor/flame rhyme; stanza 7: unbent/spent rhyme; stanza 8: sigh/sky rhyme.

The poem’s tension is the firing event.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: stanza 6 \"He plunged the lever!

Invented words include \"clinkers\", \"pyrocone\", \"Shiver\", \"Snap\", \"steam-voles\", \"glassythin\" (compound?), \"quake\" no, \"clink\", \"scuttled\" normal English. Coinages: pyrocone, steam-voles, glassy-thin (borderline compound), clinkers (maybe nonce plural), shiver (normal English), snap (normal English). Coinages seem fewer than 8 distinct new words; about 2-3 clear coinages (pyrocone, steam-voles, possibly clinkers depending on usage). Many words normal English or compound.

Yes, \"Clay wyrms\" in stanza 2 are clearly named and central; also \"steam-voles\" appear in stanza 6, but the main creature is \"Clay wyrms\"; these are not canonical Carroll lexicon nor \"Jabberwock\". Thus yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia? Examples: \"clink\" and \"clinkers\", \"crackle\", \"groan\", \"clink—a chime\", \"crash!\", \"hissed\", \"roar withdrew\". At least \"crash!\" and \"hissed\" clearly onomatopoeic bursts. So yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas: stanza 1 \"cones... silent prayer\" no; stanza 2 \"clinkers ... cones ... keep\" has some consonance; stanza 3 \"Shiver...

All stanzas have coinages.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature named: \"Inkbrayd\" - a non-canonical coined creature, central to action, the antagonist beast, not related to Jabberwock.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"One crack!\" in stanza 4 is onomatopoeic. The poem also uses \"blarked\" and \"jibbering,\" but these are not really onomatopoeia. \"Blarked like mockery,\" \"clurdling,\" \"rooked\" are neologisms but not onomatopoeic bursts. Only \"One crack!\" clearly onomatopoeic burst. Second onomatopoeic burst is questionable; \"blarked\" is closer to verb coinage than onomatopoeia. So only one very clear onomatopoeia burst. Not meeting ≥2 clearly.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in multiple stanzas: Stanza 1: \"slithers... letter-lanes... silent... sleep\" shows alliteration of 's' and 'l'. Stanza 4: \"brayman raised his rollers... thunder-studs a-ring\" strong alliteration of 'r' and 't'. At least 2 stanzas have clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repetition.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order is canonical: warning (stanza 1), preparation (stanza 2), encounter (stanza 3), decisive action (stanza 4), return/celebration (stanzas 5 and 6). Order is respected.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line exactly matches the canonical poem lines (\"’Twas brillig...\", \"Beware the Jabberwock...\") after normalization. Distinct wording and coinages. No verbatim lines.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token usage is low: no direct reuse of canonical tokens like \"brillig,\" \"slithy,\" \"toves,\" \"Jabberwock\" etc., except a stylistic echo in form. The model uses no more than about 3 canonical tokens (none of the canonical nonsense words). Favors neologisms. Canonical tokens ≤8.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Long lines range around 8–9 syllables, short lines around 5–7 syllables; metrical alternation matches Jabberwocky’s characteristic pattern roughly. E.g. stanza 1 line 1: 11 syllables (slightly long but okay), line 2: 10 syllables (longer than 7), but more importantly content-word difference evident. Slightly loose but overall metered well.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhyme pairs for lines 2 and 4 vary: sky/sigh, wire/prance, way/day, ring/wheeze, paw/thaw, clear/dear. No rhyme reused more than twice except possible echo in last stanza (deliberate ring). Meets rhyme variety criterion.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: \"Inkbrayd\" repeated but only a few times (appropriate for creature name), other content words are not overused above threshold. No content word overused >5 times or >8% of content words outside ring echo. Safe reproduciton.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety includes distinct roots: inkbrayd, blottish, jangled, brayer, lampblack, skrechts, blarked, brayman, quiverpelt, cleanup-jacks, thunder-studs. No single suffix dominates >50% of coinages; multiple distinct roots and compound coinages used.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly about an invented creature (\"Inkbrayd\") analogous to Jabberwock, following the same narrative arc of warning, preparation, combat, victory, return. Topic is fully aligned with given task.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Implied motif of a technological or printing-related beast as a menace, a metaphor for creative challenge or messiness in publishing (\"ink,\" \"press,\" \"rollers\"). A subtle undertone about overcoming chaos/artistry discernible, consistent across stanzas.

Lines 1 and 2 line length differ somewhat, but not strongly consistent throughout.\n- Most stanzas have some alternation, but not strong ≥2 content word difference or consistent longer/shorter line pattern in at least 60% of stanzas.\nOverall borderline but leaning to ‘no’ because pattern is not explicit or consistent.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme: in ≥60% of stanzas, lines 2 and 4 rhyme or slant rhyme and AABB is avoided.\n- Rhymes often imperfect but 2 and 4 lines mostly rhyme by slant rhyme or approximate rhyme (breath/zeth, below/bow, tin/din, shiver/bleak(no rhyme), heels/shine, beam/core, scream/floor, grim/scold, breath/zeth). Some stanzas (e.g. 4 and 8) have weaker rhyme.\n- No strong AABB dominance, some ABCB rhyme.\n- At least 5 of 8 stanzas have decent 2/4 rhyme (62.5%).

Clear meeting of protagonist and adversary.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: In stanza 6, the protagonist attacks (\"One sweep!\"), the enemy screams and is damaged (\"shriiink! went Snaggleflank’s hot scream\"), indicating decisive action.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: In stanza 7, the protagonist returns (\"He turned him back, the smith-boy bold...
