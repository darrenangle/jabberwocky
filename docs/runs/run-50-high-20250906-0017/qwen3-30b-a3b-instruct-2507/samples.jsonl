6th stanza shifts to ABBAA — deliberate disruption.  \n- **Repetition Guard**: Repeated sounds (e.g., *hush*), but contextually fresh.  \n- **Coinage Variety**: 15+ neologisms, all distinct and purposeful.  \n- **Topic Adherence**: *Reglet* and *furniture* are central and transformed.  \n- **Subtext**: Hidden commentary on domestic unease;

A flitch. A flint-flecked flaw.  \nThe Hum’s last note—*a thundering maw!*  \nIt yawns, and gapes on gilded jaws,  \nAnd licks the air with liquid claws.  \n\nSo pluck the pelt, the plume, the thread,  \nAnd pierce the core with *sprocket* lead!  \nNot axe, not bow, but sudden *shriek*—  \nThe bolt of Blythe that cracks the sleek!  \n\nIt shrieks in shards, then fades in hum,  \nLike dust on glass, like light from drum.  \nThe Orin’s hum now stutters, thin—  \nThen stills. The glim begins again.  \n\nAnd though at dusk the bells may swell,  \nAnd faintly thrum the roots below—  \nNo hum, no hush, no hollow cry,  \nNo trace of dread beneath the sky—  \n\nFor in the still, a soft “*mrrm*” is heard,  \nNot threat, not tale, but something stirred.  \nAnd in the dawn, a leaf takes wing—  \nThe Orin Bell?
