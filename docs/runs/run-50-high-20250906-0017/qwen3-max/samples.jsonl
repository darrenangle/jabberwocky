Each stanza has 4 lines (quatrains). Total stanzas between 5 and 8? Yes (7). All quatrains? Yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter pattern (alternating longer and shorter lines with 2+ content word difference): Checking the lines suggests mostly consistent alternation between longer and shorter lines in most stanzas (lines 1 and 3 longer; 2 and 4 shorter), with 5+ stanzas showing this pattern ≥60%. Yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (lines 2 and 4 rhyme/slant rhyme) in ≥60% stanzas:  \nStanza 1: groans / thin - near rhyme weak  \nStanza 2: dread / dwell - clear rhyme  \nStanza 3: stood / maze - no rhyme  \nStanza 4: *snick—* / quick! - partial rhyme  \nStanza 5: spent / lent - clear rhyme  \nStanza 6: cried / guide - clear rhyme  \nStanza 7: grones / grin - no rhyme  \nOut of 7 stanzas, 4 have (2,4) rhyme or slant rhyme → 57%, below threshold.  \nAlso does not avoid AABB dominance (mostly ABAB and some variation). Slightly borderline but pattern mostly mild. No.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Final stanza reuses the opening stanza lines with slight variation (\"grones\" vs \"groans\", \"bendin’ grin\" repeated as warning); at least 2 content words repeated (\"kiln-wit cones\", \"brimful dusk\", \"bendin’ grin\"). Strong matching with refrain. Yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition/warning present: \"Beware the Kiln-Witson’s bendin’ grin!\" in first stanza (line 4), repeated in last stanza—yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation or armament before confrontation: \"He took his tongs (the grip was dread), / Long watched the pyro’s crimson thread; / Then sought he where the kiln-fumes swell\" — clearly preparation with tool (tongs), observation and seeking the place. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: \"And, as in uffish thought he stood, / The Kiln-Witson, with clay-foot shood, / Came blundering through the sagger maze,\" — yes, the meeting of protagonist and adversary is clear.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive slaying action: \"One, two! One, two! His tongs went *snick—* / Through glaze and grit and warp-stick quick! / He left it steaming, slack and spent,\" — decisive act concluding the tension. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: Next stanza \"’And hast thou slain the Bend? he cried. / ’Come to my arms, my beamish guide! / O frabjous day! Calay! Huzzah! / He clinked his mug (with cider, raw).\" — clear jubilant return/celebration. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Distinct invented coinages count ≥8:  \nkiln-wit, mallewarp, glaze-tongue, bendin’, pyro’s, kiln-fumes, warped ware, clay-foot shood, sagger maze, warp-stick, brimful, grones, Calay, huzzah (though huzzah is established English interjection, so borderline), plus \"bend\" as a coined entity—about 10+ coinages counting invented compounds and nonce words. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Every stanza has ≥1 coinage, e.g.:  \n1) kiln-wit, mallewarp, glaze-tongue, bendin’  \n2) pyro’s, kiln-fumes, warped  \n3) uffish, clay-foot, shood, sagger  \n4) snick, warp-stick  \n5) steaming, slack (less coined but matches invented style)  \n6) beamish, Calay, Huzzah (beamish canonical, Calay and Huzzah uncertain but can count as nonce)  \n7) brimful, kiln-wit, grones, bendin’  \nAll stanzas contain at least one coinage or nonce compound. Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central, not \"Jabberwock\": The \"Kiln-Witson\" is clearly named, described as the adversary, distinct and central. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeic bursts ≥2: \"crackle-hiss\" in stanza 4, \"snick—\" in stanza 4 line 1, \"clinked\" in stanza 6 line 4 (mildly onomatopoeic). At least two clear bursts \"crackle-hiss\" and \"snick—\". Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance:  \n- Stanza 1: \"kiln-wit cones\", \"twist their tips\"  \n- Stanza 2: \"grip was dread\", \"pyro’s crimson\"  \n- Stanza 3: \"Kiln-Witson... clay-foot shood\", \"sagger maze\" (soft),  \n- Stanza 4: \"glaze and grit and warp-stick quick\" (g and w sounds).  \nAt least two stanzas (~stanzas 1,4) have clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order follows canonical sequence: warning (stanza 1), preparation (2), encounter (3), decisive act (4-5), return/celebration (6), ring echo (7). Matches canonical order. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim canonical lines check: No lines match precisely any canonical poem line after normalizing punctuation/spaces. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used ≤8:  \nOriginal canon words used: \"uffish\", \"beamish\", \"snick\" (close to \"snicker-snack\" but not exact), \"frabjous\" (used as \"frabjous day?\" replaced by \"Calay\" and \"Huzzah\" instead), and \"came\" (common). Some canonical words replaced or not present. Rough count: less than or equal to 8 canonical words reused. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines ~8-9 syllables, shorter lines ~5-7 per stanza examined.  \nExample stanza 1:  \nLine 1: ’Twas brimful dusk, and kiln-wit cones (8 syllables)  \nLine 2: Did twist their tips in furnace groans; (8 syllables) borderline, should be shorter?  \nLine 3: All mallewarp and glaze-tongue thin— (7 syllables) shorter line?  \nLine 4: Beware the Kiln-Witson’s bendin’ grin! (8 syllables) long line instead of short (rhythms somewhat off strict Jabberwocky tightness).  \nOther stanzas show some syllable count deviations, but generally lines split into longer/shorter lines reasonably close to 8/6 pattern. Considering close but borderline due to some lines longer than the reference's short lines. Partial but do not count this as yes due to strictness. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety (2,4 end rhymes) without exact end word reuse more than twice:  \nRhyme words: groans/thin (weak), dread/dwell (1), stood/maze (no), *snick—*/quick! (slant rhyme), spent/lent (1), cried/guide (1), grones/grin (no).  \nNo end word exact repetitions more than twice; rhyme variety seems good. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No content word appears excessively repeated across all stanzas. No single word dominates. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Over 10 coinages across 7 stanzas, roots seem diverse (kiln, warp, glaze, pyrom, clay, sagger, bend, snick), no single root dominates >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly addresses the made-up creature \"Kiln-Witson\" as the central subject, fits the style of a quixotic monster hunt similar to Jabberwocky without substituting unrelated subject. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Implied undertone of craft, artisanal trial, heroic confrontation with fire and transformation (kiln, pottery metaphors), fits coherent underlying motif of artisan’s quest or trial; beyond surface action there is a subtle undertone.

Borderline but not clearly met for every quatrain.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: rhyme pairs (2,4) vary with no exact end word repeated more than twice excluding ring stanza.

Alternation is not perfect but clearly present in majority.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme is mostly ABCB or ABAB; lines 2 and 4 rhyme or slant rhyme in 5 of 7 stanzas (~71%), and AABB dominance avoided. Some slant rhymes present, e.g., \"tray\"/\"day\", \"spins\"/\"shins\", and \"stilled right there\"/\"rollers gladdened\" weaker, but overall majority stanzas have rhyming (2,4) line pairs.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza repeats the first stanza almost fully with slight textual variation (\"And the brayer went “—” (but not today)\"), thus echoing opening with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases, functions as clear ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Second stanza includes clear admonition: \"Beware the Brayer-Chatter, child! / The squeak that skids, the squelch that spins! / Beware the Inkblot, wild and wiled! / And shun the Roller’s rumbly shins!\" as an early warning against danger.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Third stanza shows protagonist preparing: \"He took his gouge—sharp, keen, and keenly— / Long time the murky marks he sought— / Then rested by the press, serenely, / And dreamed of prints his hands had wrought.\" This indicates preparation and planning before encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Fourth stanza portrays the encounter: \"And, as in uffish thought he sat, / The Brayer-Chatter, with a *skritch-skree*, / Came blunder-slithering—squelch and spat— / Its rubber ribs a-wobbling free!\" Clear meeting between protagonist and adversary.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Fifth stanza contains decisive action resolving the conflict: \"One, two!
