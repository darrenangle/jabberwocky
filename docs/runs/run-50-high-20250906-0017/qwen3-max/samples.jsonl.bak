One slice! The nib did gleam—  \nHe carved the clause with steady hand;  \nThe beast collapsed in blotted stream,  \nIts syntax split by bold command.\n\n“And hast thou slain the Scribe-Line dread?”  \nHis mentor cried and clapped his back.  \nHe bowed and whispered, “Quill o’erhead—”  \nThen shelved the blade inside its rack.\n\n’Twas scribble-dark, and crisp the page,  \nWith kiridashi sharp as spite;  \nThe Line now sleeps in quiet cage,  \nIts wrath confined to ruled respite.", "info": {}}
