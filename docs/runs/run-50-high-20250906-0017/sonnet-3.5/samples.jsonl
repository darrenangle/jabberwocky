Count confirmed at 8 stanzas and all quatrains.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Alternate line length pattern (longer/shorter) in majority of stanzas is unclear; syllable counts approximately 9-7 alternating but content-word difference threshold (≥2) is borderline or hard to confirm in more than 5 stanzas. Likely below 60% definitive match.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Most stanzas rhyme on lines 2 and 4 with slant rhymes permitted; rhyme mostly on second and fourth line holds in ≥5 stanzas; no strong dominance of AABB; pattern aligns with the ballad rhyme scheme.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes opening stanza with repeated phrases \"’Twas glimmer-gloam,\" \"whiff and whisper,\" framing, and repeated concepts like scoring blade, matching signature ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early warning present in second stanza: \"Beware the Kiridash, my friend! Its bevel-bite ...\" which is a clear admonition to protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation is shown: protagonist takes \"trusty angle-vise\" and \"marking gauge held tight,\" then rests near workbench light before encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter described in fourth stanza: \"The Kiridash... came slashing through the space between...\" meeting the adversary.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action present in fifth stanza: protagonist’s \"tools rang true,\" \"straight-edge flashed,\" resulting in \"beast…scored perfect lines,\" resolving tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration in sixth stanza: call to celebrate mastery and glowing workbench, joy and accomplishment acknowledged.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>At least 8 distinct invented coinages: e.g., Kiridash, glimmer-gloam, scribbly sheets, whiff, slench, scritchly, bevel-bite, Pencilbar, graphite-grasp, angle-vise, line-mist, metal-mouth, etc.—well beyond 8 coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage or invented compound word (e.g., scribbly, slench, bevel-bite, Graphite-grasp, scribe-marks, etc.).</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creature/entity is the \"Kiridash,\" non-canonical and central to the poem's conflict and climax.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>At least two onomatopoeic bursts: \"scritchly sounds\" and \"One, two! One, two! His tools rang true,\" also verbal sounds like \"scritchly\" and \"rang true\" resemble onomatopoeia sufficiently.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Multiple stanzas show within-line alliteration and consonance: e.g., \"scribbly sheets,\" \"whiff and whisper,\" \"scoring blade,\" \"metal-mouth,\" and \"scribe-marks made the surface sing.\"</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc beats appear in canonical order: early warning admonition, preparation, encounter confrontation, decisive act, return/celebration clearly in successive stanzas.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line matches exactly the canonical poem. No verbatim reuse of lines from \"Jabberwocky,\" normalizing punctuation and spacing.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used (e.g., \"beware\") ≤8; main coinages dominate; canonical lexicon very limited or absent as per \"Jabberwocky\" list.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Longer lines roughly 8–9 syllables; shorter lines about 5–7 syllables; syllable pattern is consistent and close to \"Jabberwocky\" style.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhymes on lines 2 and 4 vary; no rhyming end word appears more than twice except ring echo repetition; rhyme variety is good.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No content word is overused; no single word exceeds 5 times or 8% of total content words; lexical repetition is guarded.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show distinct roots well above 4; no single suffix dominates—variety in inventive formations.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>The poem addresses the named topic \"Kiridash,\" a crafted tool or creature with clear conflict and story; no subject substitution.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext is coherent with motif of craftsmanship, struggle, and mastery; implied undertone of battling a difficult tool and achieving artistic triumph.</C24_think>\n</think>\n\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.9583333333333334, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "reward": 0.9583333333333334, "criteria_yes": 23, "label": "high"}
