{"i": 0, "prompt": "Write a poem about underpass echo in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about underpass echo in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Let me start by recalling what makes Jabberwocky unique. Carroll uses lots of neologisms, playful language, and a whimsical yet slightly ominous tone. The poem has a rhythmic structure, often with anapestic tetrameter, and features made-up words that evoke vivid, fantastical imagery.\n\nFirst, I need to focus on the underpass echo. So, elements like tunnels, echoes, sounds reverberating, maybe some mysterious creatures or personified elements. The challenge is to blend the concrete idea of an underpass with the fantastical language of Jabberwocky.\n\nThe title should be catchy and a bit nonsensical but still relevant. Maybe \"The Tulgey Tunnel's Refrain\" since \"tulgey\" is a term from Jabberwocky, and \"refrain\" relates to echoes.\n\nNow, structure: quatrains with a consistent rhyme scheme, probably ABAB. The first stanza should set the scene. Use alliteration and invented verbs. Words like \"gallivant\" and \"galleon\" to add that Carroll-esque flair. The tunnel as a living entity, \"murm’ring musics\" to hint at the echo.\n\nNext stanza introduces the echo as a creature. Maybe \"Echoflux\" as a noun, with \"wlak\" (a blend of walk and something odd) and \"gromble\" for the sounds. The echo grows, taking on a life of its own. \"Cheshire chime\" references the Cheshire Cat, adding a Carroll touch.\n\nThird stanza brings in more action. \"Brouhaha beetles\" making noise, \"frumious\" (another Carroll word) feet moving. The tunnel's breath, \"mome-wracks\" (from \"mome\" in Jabberwocky) howling. The echo as a beast that's hunted, but slippery.\n\nFourth stanza escalates with a chase. \"Outgrib\" as a verb, \"burble\" sounds. The echo leaves traces but vanishes, leaving the traveler to question reality. The tunnel's whisper as a warning or invitation.\n\nFinally, closing stanza with the echo lingering, the tunnel's song, and the traveler's departure. Emphasize the enduring mystery of the echo. Use \"vorpal\" (another Carroll term) to strengthen the connection.\n\nCheck for rhyme and meter. Ensure the language is playful with made-up words that still convey the intended imagery. Make sure each stanza flows into the next, maintaining the whimsical yet eerie atmosphere of Jabberwocky. Avoid being too literal; keep the poem abstract and fantastical while rooted in the underpass setting.\n</think>\n\n**The Tulgey Tunnel's Refrain**  \n\nBeware the Echoflux, my son,  \nThe jaws that Enumerable-grin,  \nThe tunnel's murmur, thick as sun  \nThat drools through galleon'd flumplenin.  \n\nBeware the wlak and gromble's hum,  \nThe vogs that vagulate the air,  \nAnd shun the frabjous Cheshire chime  \nThat breeds in hollows, void of stair.  \n\nHe took the vorpal pounct in hand—  \n\" 'Tis just a burbly brook's CONFAB,\"  \nBut tulgey tunnels twist all sound—  \nBeware the Echoflux's crab Waltz grab!  \n\nHecharged the void where Gumby's foam  \nDid sloam the walls in glimmerwings,  \nBut Echoflux, a jackal's yawn,  \nCame snicker-snack with iron rings.  \n\n\"O frumious foe!\" the youth did cry,  \n\"Your jabber's all in reverb's thrall—  \nA gorging hymn of what's gone by,  \nA reve 'midst shuttles of the Mall!\"  \n\nThe tunnel's breath, a steam of inklings,  \n Blew Out the brute with chuff and chide,  \nAnd all the wabe grew still as twit,  \nSave for the road that swerved inside.  \n\nSo heed the chortled moral, Son:  \nThe Echoflux, though slain by rhyme,  \nLurks in each mome-wrack, grunty, stun,  \nTill \"Time\" itself shall Tarnish thyme.", "info": {"topic": "underpass echo"}, "reward": 0.5, "label": "low", "criteria_yes": 9, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.5, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 1.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}}

Maybe something like \"The Fogwiffy Morn\" to mimic \"Jabberwocky.\" Now, setting the scene: a eerie, mystical morning with the fog as a character. Use a rhyme scheme similar to the original, probably ABAB. \n\nIn the first stanza, introduce the mist creeping in. Use alliteration and made-up verbs, like \"slinkwyrms\" or \"glimmerwings.\" Next, describe the fog's effect on the environment—maybe personify the mist as a creature.

{"i": 2, "prompt": "Create a poem about déjà vu in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, I need to create a poem about déjà vu in the style of 'Jabberwocky.' First, let's recall what makes 'Jabberwocky' unique. Lewis Carroll uses made-up words, playful language, and a whimsical yet somewhat ominous tone. The structure is consistent with a certain rhythm and rhyme scheme, often AABB.\n\nSo, the user wants the poem to capture the essence of déjà vu, which is that feeling of familiarity or recognition in a situation that's actually new. I need to convey that eerie, time-warp sensation. Now, how to blend that with the 'Jabberwocky' style.\n\nStarting with the title. 'Jabberwocky' has a nonsense title that sounds meaningful. Maybe something like \"Déjà Vu's Wamble\" or \"The Frumious Déjà Vu.\" Let's brainstorm. \"The Mome Cronce\" comes to mind, as \"mome\" is from the original, meaning a fool, but here it can be part of the whimsy.\n\nNext, the opening lines. Original uses \"Twas brillig and the slithy toves...\" So, setting a scene with action and invented creatures. For déjà vu, maybe starting with a time reference: \"Beware the mome crocnce, my son! / The clocks that wibble, wamble, and run...\" Here, \"wibble\" and \"wamble\" are playful verbs suggesting unsteady movement, fitting the time distortion.\n\nIncorporate the idea of repeating moments. \"The sh rotational tweedle-suns...\" \"Rotational\" hints at cycles, \"tweedle-suns\" references both the sun and maybe Tweedledum/Tweedledee, adding a Carroll touch.\n\nNeed some made-up creatures or terms. \"Jubjub's ghostly vespers hum\" – Jubjub is from the original, so that's a good tie-in. Vespers are evening prayers, giving a haunting feel.\n\nMiddle stanza about the experience: \"Your feet upon a whispered path / Will trip on seconds-lived-in-twain...\" \"Whispered path\" suggests familiarity, \"seconds-lived-in-twain\" implies split moments.\n\nInclude a paradoxical element, like \"the air athick with yester-morn.\" Mixing past and present, thickness in the air.\n\nEnd with a warning to confront the feeling: \"So grab the vorpal clave and fight! / For time's a loaf we slice askew— / 'Tis just the déjà vu's maunder, / A mome crocnce—er, didn't you?\" Using \"vorpal\" from the original, and \"maunder\" meaning to talk indistinctly, fitting the confusion.\n\nCheck the rhythm and rhyme. Each stanza should follow the AABB pattern with a trochaic meter. Read it aloud to test the flow. Adjust any lines that stumble.\n\nEnsure the poem doesn't just describe déjà vu but immerses the reader in the fantastical, logic-defying world of 'Jabberwocky.' Make sure the made-up words enhance the theme rather than obscure it. Each verse should build the sense of being caught in a familiar yet strange loop, with creatures and actions that feel both new and remembered.\n\nFinally, the closing lines should tie back to the title and the central metaphor, leaving the reader with that lingering sense of \"haven't I heard this before?\" Maybe end with a question that mirrors the confusion of déjà vu, addressed to the reader directly.\n</think>\n\n**The Mome Crocnce**  \n\nBeware the mome crocnce, my son!  \nThe clocks that wibble, wamble, and run—  \nThe sh rotational tweedle-suns  \nThat glimmer-flux as moments are undone.  \n\nOh, frumious loops of what's-now-past,  \nThe jubjub's ghostly vespers hum.  \nYour heart may leap with knowing dread—  \n*\"This, this all’s happened—\" (“All, all’s been said!”)*  \n\nYour feet upon a whispered path  \nWill trip on seconds-lived-in-twain,  \nThe air athick with yester-morn,  \nA mimic wave where all’s forsworn.  \n\nSo grab the vorpal clave and fight!  \nFor time’s a loaf we slice askew—  \n’Tis just the déjà vu’s maunder,  \nA mome crocnce—er, didn’t you?", "info": {"topic": "déjà vu"}, "reward": 0.5, "label": "low", "criteria_yes": 9, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.5, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 0.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 1.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}}

{"i": 7, "prompt": "Compose a poem on layover bay in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about Layover Bay in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" Let me recall what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique—its playful language, made-up words, rhythmic structure, and whimsical yet slightly ominous tone. \n\nFirst, I need to capture that essence. The original uses a lot of nonsense words that still evoke imagery. So, I should invent similar-sounding terms related to a bay setting. Words like \"splishyblop\" could mimic waves, and \"flazzlepaws\" might be a creature.\n\nNext, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has a consistent meter and rhyme scheme, mostly quatrains with an ABAB pattern. I'll need to maintain that. Let me outline the stanzas to ensure the rhythm flows smoothly.\n\nNow, the theme of a layover—maybe a traveler stuck between destinations. The bay is a liminal space, so blending that with fantastical elements. Creatures and obstacles that represent the frustrations or wonders of waiting. \n\nIn the original, there's a narrative of a hero battling the Jabberwock. Here, maybe the traveler faces challenges in Layover Bay. The \"mome wraths\" could become \"grumplenui,\" and \"Beware the Jabberwock\" might translate to warnings about local beasts like \"snickerwings.\"\n\nI should also include a sense of urgency and eventual departure, mirroring the hero's return.Ending with the traveler moving on, perhaps with a lingering memory of the bay. Need to check that made-up words are consistent and fit the rhythm. Testing each line's syllable count to match the original's iambic tetrameter.\n\nPossible pitfalls: forced rhymes, inconsistent meter, or words that don't evoke the right imagery. Let me revise any lines that stumble. Ensuring the title fits the style too, maybe alliterative and playful. \"The Layover Bay's Frabjous Flarp\" uses \"frabjous\" from the original and \"flarp\" as a nonsense verb.\n\nAlright, time to piece it together, stanza by stanza, maintaining the whimsy and structure. Once done, read it aloud to test the flow. Make adjustments where needed.

{"i": 8, "prompt": "Create a poem about screen burn‑in in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about screen burn-in in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" Let me recall that \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll uses nonsense words and a playful, rhythmic structure. The challenge here is to blend technical terms related to screen burn-in with that whimsical, made-up language.\n\nFirst, I need to understand screen burn-in. It's a display issue where a static image stays on the screen permanently, common in older OLED screens. Terms like pixels, static, ghosting, marquees, LCDs, plasma, Gorilla Glass, AMOLED might be relevant. Now, how to Jabberwocky-fy these terms?\n\nThe original poem has a consistent meter, mostly trochaic tetrameter. So I need to maintain that rhythm. Also, the use of alliteration and portmanteau words is key. For example, \"slithy\" combines \"slimy\" and \"lithe.\" \n\nLet me brainstorm some made-up terms. Maybe \"pixelfroth\" for pixel-related issues, \"glowjaws\" for the static images that cause burn-in. \"Static's grim marquee\" could refer to the persistent image. \"Ghostcreep\" might describe the lingering effect. \n\nI should structure the poem similarly to \"Jabberwocky,\" with a narrative flow: introduction of the problem, the battle against it, and a resolution. Including a warning or advice, like keeping screens active, would mirror the original's cautionary tone.\n\nNeed to check the rhyme scheme. \"Jabberwocky\" uses ABAB, so each stanza's second and fourth lines rhyme. Let me draft some lines ensuring that. For example:\n\n\"Beware the burn-in’s pixelfroth, my son!   \nThe jaws that glimmer, glowjaws wet,  \nThe screen that freezes, stuck as one—  \nBeware the static’s grim marquee, and shun  \nThe LCD’s revenant regret.\"\n\nHere, \"son\" and \"shun\" aren't rhyming. Oops, need to adjust. Maybe end with \"and shun\" and \"regret\" to keep the rhyme. Wait, \"son\" and \"shun\" do rhyme if pronounced similarly. Maybe it's okay.\n\nContinuing, introducing terms like \"plasma’s wraith\" and \"Gorilla Glass\" for the screen's durability. Suggesting movement on the screen as a solution. Ending with a warning to avoid stagnant images, using playful language.\n\nNeed to ensure the poem maintains the whimsical tone while explaining the technical issue. Testing the flow aloud to catch any rhythm issues. Once done, add a fitting title, maybe playing on \"Jabberwocky\" like \"The Burn-in’s Marquee\" to tie in the theme.\n</think>\n\n**The Burn-in’s Marquee**  \n\nBeware the burn-in’s pixelfroth, my son!  \nThe jaws that glimmer, glowjaws wet,  \nThe screen that freezes, stuck as one—  \nBeware the static’s grim marquee, and shun  \nThe LCD’s revenant regret.  \n\nHe took the pixelwhip in hand:  \nLongtime the plasma’s wraith had glared,  \nAnd many a screen died, ghostcrept, bland,  \nBy LCD crypts, with submenu snared.  \n“Beware the marquee’s burn,” he’d been warned.  \nBut “Frabjous firmware!” he vogued, undeterred.  \n\nTwo, two to stir the screen’s stale night!  \nThe AMOLED’s glow Gnarl did steep,  \nAnd with a Gorilla Glass shield bright,  \nHe galloped—Burble!—down the deep,  \nWhere dead-pixel spiders spin their threads,  \nAnd VR wasps nest in device heads.  \n\n“Flee,LCD specter!” he warcroaked.  \nBut oh! The marquee, grim and gray,  \nHad seared its mark where menus bloomed,  \nA phantom grid, foreverset to stay.  \n“Reboot! Reboot!” the crowd cried late,  \nAs ghosting crept with substrate weight.  \n\nThe battle slyth’d with gamma blades,  \nHe flashed the screen—a furious fizz—  \nAnd danced, pixelwhip a’flump, displayed  \nThat stagnant art shall mar and miz.  \nYet some, my son, who screens neglect  \nShall rue the burn-in’s pixeled wretch.  \n\nFor so it was in CRT’s reign,  \nWhen tubes grew old and phosphors bled—  \nThe warning still outjabs the pane:  \n“Keep motion, lest the static’s dread  \nMarquee your view, a blitzened stain,  \nIn wuggle, wum, the burn-in’s bane!”", "info": {"topic": "screen burn‑in"}, "reward": 0.5555555555555556, "label": "medium", "criteria_yes": 10, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.5555555555555556, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}}

It's filled with neologisms, playful language, and a whimsical tone, mixing nonsense words with vivid imagery. The structure is quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme.\n\nFirst, I need to brainstorm elements associated with Monte Carlo: casinos, luxury, maybe the Monaco Grand Prix, ocean views, wealth, high stakes, glamour. Now, how to twist these into Carroll-esque nonsense terms. For example, \"tweedle\" sounds could become \"Tweedlebaccarat\" blending \"tweedle\" with \"baccarat\". The \"Jabberwock\" itself could be a metaphor for the allure or danger of gambling.\n\nNeed to keep the rhythm similar. Let me attempt the first stanza with setting the scene. Maybe \"Beware the Tweetsnorai\" as a playful warning. Incorporate the coast and shimmering lights. Then introduce the games and the blend of real and imaginary elements.\n\nNext, the narrative should have a sense of adventure and caution, mirroring the original's journey. The protagonist might face the challenges of the casino, with made-up creatures like \"Floopet\" dealers or \"Mimsy Milliners\". Use alliteration and portmanteaus. Rhyme scheme check: lines 1 and 3, 2 and 4.\n\nIn the second stanza, describe the casino's interior with whimsy. \"Glimmerglass\" for slot machines, \"frabjulice\" drinks. Maybe the \"Mome Raths\" as excited onlookers. Build up to the central conflict—resisting the temptations or facing the risks.\n\nThird stanza could involve the climax, perhaps a high-stakes moment. \"The Juggernaut's whirl\" for roulette. Use words like \"galumphing\" from the original. The \"Tweedlebaccarat\" as characters engaged in the game. Then the resolution, walking away or overcoming the challenges.\n\nFinally, conclude with a reflection on the experience, using sunset imagery and a lingering sense of the fantastical. Ensure the title captures the essence, maybe something like \"The Jaws of Jouvence\" blending \"jaws\" (danger) with \"Jouvence\" (youth or temptation).\n\nCheck for consistent meter, usually trochaic tetrameter.
