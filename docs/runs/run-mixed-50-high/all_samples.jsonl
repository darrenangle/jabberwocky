The traveler arms themselves with a \"glintsnap\" and \"fizzleflint.\" Need onomatopoeia like \"ticka-tap.\" Maybe mention \"shadowthorn\" for the creature's lair.\n\nThird stanza: Encounter. Describe the Echoflux with \"jinglejaws\" and \"gloopernaughts.\" Onomatopoeia like \"thrum\" and \"wheee\" to mimic the echo. The battle scene where the creature is slain.\n\nFourth stanza: Return and celebration. Use \"flumplenax\" and \"jubbleness\" to show joy. Mention the \"flarp\" of a gate and a new coinage like \"flibberjibits.\" Echo the opening warning at the end.\n\nCheck for alliteration and lively cadence. Make sure each stanza has the required elements without repeating lines. Avoid canonical words from the original Jabberwocky.

Echo the opening at the end. Avoid verbatim lines; limit canonical words.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about morning fog in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" First, I need to recall the characteristics of that poem. Carroll uses made-up words, playful language, a rhyming scheme, and a narrative structure. The request specifies a ballad rhyme, so ABAB or ABCB. Let me check the example they provided to ensure I'm on the right track.\n\nThe title needs to be catchy and hint at the fog theme. Maybe something like \"Mornfog'sumblrieve\"? Hmm, \"Mornfog\" combines morning and fog. Then \"umblrieve\" sounds like a mix of tumble and believe, with a whimsical twist. That seems to fit the invented language style.\n\nNext, the arc: warning, preparation, encounter/slay, return/celebration, and echo the opening. The example starts with \"Beware the mornfog'sumblrieve,\" which sets the warning. The first stanza introduces the creature \"Flogwyrms\" and uses alliteration like \"wamble\" and \"wove.\" Onomatopoeia like \"hizz\" and \"ploom\" are included.\n\nFor the second stanza, preparation. The protagonist takes action, sharpening a blade made of starlight. The invented word \"slorvish\" could mean something sluggish, and \"Flish\" might be a creature. The rhyme scheme here is ABAB. The onomatopoeia \"whirr\" and \"chime\" add to the rhythm.\n\nThe encounter in the third stanza introduces the \"Jawjub\" bird. The coinages \"flabber\" and \"gyre\" contribute to the whimsy. Alliteration like \"glibbery\" and \"guttered\" works here. The action of striking the fog with the blade and the sound \"sploff\" helps build the scene.\n\nThe return and celebration in the fourth stanza brings the protagonist back with the \"Mistmaw's\" tooth. The invented words \"flum\" and \"glowt\" add to the unique vocabulary. Alliteration like \"flum of flight\" and \"patter\" of hooves creates a lively cadence. The onomatopoeia \"chug\" and \"brrroo\" enhance the sensory experience.\n\nFinally, echoing the opening with \"Beware the mornfog'sumblrieve\" ties the poem together, reminding us of the initial warning. The closing line reinforces the cyclical nature of dawn and the lingering mystery of the fog.\n\nI need to ensure each stanza has a new creature and coinages. Checking the example: Flogwyrms, Jawjub, Mistmaw. Each has a role in the narrative. The rhymes are consistent, and the meter is lively, alternating stressed and unstressed syllables. The onomatopoeia and alliteration are sprinkled throughout to keep the verses engaging and dynamic.\n\nAvoiding verbatim lines from \"Jabberwocky\" is crucial. The user wants originality, so the invented words shouldn't be direct copies. The example seems to achieve this. Also, limiting canonical words means steering clear of overused terms, which the made-up language helps with.\n\nThe structure follows the ballad rhyme scheme. Let me verify the rhyme for each stanza. First stanza: believe/leave, wyrms/whirr. Second: bright/blade, Flish/chime. Third: gyre/fire, shiver/shatter. Fourth: tooth/truth, hooves/brews. The final echo repeats the opening lines, reinforcing the warning and closure.\n\nOverall, the example meets the requirements. Now, applying the same logic to create a new poem. Think of the warning first, introducing a creature. Then preparation with action and new words. The encounter needs a battle with onomatopoeia. Return and celebration bring the hero back, and the echo at the end. Each stanza must have coinages, alliteration, and maintain the rhythm. Let me draft each part step by step, ensuring the elements are in place without copying the example's exact phrases.\n</think>\n\n**Mornfog'sumblrieve**  \n\nBeware the mornfog’sumblrieve, my son,  \nThe Flogwyrms wamble where the wild firs groan—  \nIt wove a shroud of hizz and ploom, ’tis spun,  \nAnd frumious claws that glint like bone.  \n\nHe snatched the vorpal blade of starlight bright,  \n“Beware the slorvish Flish with eyes of bale!”  \nThe snicker-snack of glibbery wings took flight—  \nHe chime-whirred forth, his galligaskins hale.  \n\nWhen Jabberjaws with flabberjib jaws agape  \nDid gutter, “Sploff!” went blade through brume and blubber—  \nHe carved the mist where Jawjub gyres escape,  \nAs g transistor’shatter druvvled in the stubble.  \n\nBack clomped the youth, all flum of flight forsworn,  \nWith Mistmaw’s tooth, a glint of gilded tooth.  \nThe burbles sang a patter-chug of morn,  \nAnd bravo-brrroo of kettles brewed in youth.  \n\n“Beware the mornfog’sumblrieve, my son—  \nThe fog devours, yet dawn’s still half-undone.”  \nHe grinned, and slurvish light did frab the sun…  \n’Twas brillig, and the slivs outglmmed, anon.", "info": {"topic": "morning fog"}, "reward": 1.0, "label": "high", "criteria_yes": 18, "metrics": {"composite_score": 1.0, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "model_id": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "model_slug": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1"}

Echo the opening at the end. Avoid verbatim lines; limit canonical words.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about déjà vu in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" Let me break down the requirements. First, I need to recall the structure of \"Jabberwocky\"—it's a nonsense verse with made-up words, a ballad rhyme scheme (ABAB or ABCB), lively rhythm, and an adventure arc.\n\nThey specified the arc as warning, preparation, encounter/slay, return/celebration, and to echo the opening at the end. So, I need to make sure each stanza follows these stages. The poem should have a title, new coinages in each stanza, a named creature, onomatopoeia, alliteration, and avoid verbatim lines from the original.\n\nStarting with the title. \"Déjà Vu\" needs a twist. Maybe \"Déjàvulgar\" or \"Déjàvulch\"? The latter rhymes with \"clutch\" which could work. \"Beware the Déjàvulch, my son!\"—that's a strong opening, similar to \"Beware the Jabberwock.\"\n\nNext, the warning. The original uses \"jaws that bite, claws that catch.\" For déjà vu, perhaps something like \"the frabjul grasp of yore's misturn\" where \"frabjul\" is a new coinage and \"yore's misturn\" relates to past events repeating.\n\nIntroduce a creature. \"Déjàvulch\" is the main one, but maybe others like \"mome-wumps\" or \"snicker-snatch\" in later stanzas. Each needs a unique name and action.\n\nOnomatopoeia: \"Snicker-snatch\" could make a sound like \"Tlotz! Plim!\" when they attack. The encounter should have a battle with these creatures, using lively sounds.\n\nRhyme scheme: Check each quatrain follows ABAB or ABCB. For example:\n\nTake the vorpal wordlet—incy-wincy, keen—\nIn your lexicon pouch, let it glint, let it glean.\nLong the manxome borogove with mimsy tufts unseen\nJaws agape in staid reruns, déjàvulgar sheen.\n\nHere, the rhyme is keen/glean, unseen/sheen. That's ABAB. Wait, \"keen\" and \"glean\" aren't perfect rhymes. Maybe adjust to \"keen\" and \"sheen\"? Let me see. \"Vorpal wordlet\" is a nod to \"vorpal sword\" from the original, but modified.\n\nThe preparation stanza needs a weapon or tool. The \"wordlet\" as a linguistic weapon fits. Then moving to the encounter, using the wordlet against the Déjàvulch. Onomatopoeia like \"Flish! Kaboom!\" when the creature is defeated.\n\nCelebration upon return. The last stanza should echo the opening line. \"And whether 'twas but a dream, let it blear, let it bloom— / Beware the Déjàvulch, my son!\" Repeats the warning, closing the loop.\n\nCheck for new coinages in each stanza. Stanzas 1: Déjàvulch, frabjul, yore's misturn. Stanza 2: vorpal wordlet, manxome borogove, mimsy. Stanza 3: mome-wumps, snicker-snatch, tlotz, plim. Stanza 4: snicker-snatch, flish, kaboom. Stanza 5: wizzle whim, thistledown, glim. Stanza 6: echoes the opening.\n\nAlliteration: \"frabjul frost,\" \"vorpal wordlet,\" \"mome-wumps,\" \"snicker-snatch,\" \"wizzle whim,\" etc. Each stanza has some alliteration.\n\nAvoiding verbatim lines from \"Jabberwocky.\" Instead of \"He took the vorpal sword in hand,\" use \"Take the vorpal wordlet—incy-wincy, keen.\"\n\nEnsure the arc is clear: warning (first stanza), preparation (second), encounter (third and fourth), return/celebration (fifth and sixth), echoing the opening.\n\nNow, piece it all together, checking rhyme, meter, and the required elements. Make adjustments where needed to maintain the lively cadence and ballad structure. Test the flow by reading aloud, ensuring the stress patterns match the original's iambic tetrameter.\n\nFinal check for onomatopoeia and creature names. Each stanza introduces something new, and the sounds enhance the imagery. The déjavulch is slain with the wordlet, and the celebration includes fading echoes, tying back to the theme of déjà vu as a familiar yet fleeting experience.\n</think>\n\n**Beware the Déjàvulch**  \n\nBeware the Déjàvulch, my son!  \nThe frabjul frost that clings to time,  \nBeware the glufters, spin and stun—  \nThe jaws agape with *almost* thine.  \n\nTake the vorpal wordlet—incy-wincy, keen—  \nIn your lexicon pouch, let it glint, let it glean.  \nLong the manxome borogove with mimsy tufts unseen  \nJaws agape in staid reruns, déjàvulgar sheen.  \n\nHe traced the mome-wumps where the tulgey yaşmak grew,  \nSnicker-snatchers lurked, all a-tizz and a-glint.  \nBut “Frivolee!” he shouted.

Let me start by recalling the structure of \"Jabberwocky\"—ballad rhyme with an ABAB or ABCB pattern, lively cadence, made-up words, onomatopoeia, alliteration, and a narrative arc. The arc needs to be warning, preparation, encounter/slay, return/celebration, and echo the opening at the end.\n\nFirst, the title. \"Jabberwocky\" has a whimsical, made-up title. Maybe something like \"The Fizzlethorpe's Fricassee\" to incorporate the brown butter theme and a creature name. \n\nNow the warning. The original starts with \"Beware the Jabberwock\". So I need a creature related to cooking, perhaps the Fizzlethorpe. The warning should mention the danger of burning the butter. Use alliteration and coinages here. Maybe \"Beware the Fizzlethorpe's froth\" and describe the butter's state.\n\nNext, preparation. The protagonist needs tools and maybe a method. Introduce another creature, like the Splishyblop or something, to assist or be part of the process. Use onomatopoeia here, like \"sizzle\" or \"crackle\". Maybe \"Take the frothspoon, keen and bright\" and describe the cooking process.\n\nThen the encounter/slay. Describe the actual cooking where the butter transforms. The creature (Fizzlethorpe) is conquered by the chef. Use action words and more coinages. Maybe \"When the pot chants 'froth-froth-flee!'\" and the butter turns golden, defeating the Fizzlethorpe.\n\nReturn/celebration. The chef returns victorious, maybe serving the dish. Introduce a celebratory scene with another creature, like the Meringue Maw. Use onomatopoeia for the feast, \"slurp\" or \"crunch\". \"Then the Meringue Maws all cheer\" and the protagonist tastes the success.\n\nEcho the opening. Repeat the first line or a variation to close the loop. End with the warning again, tying it back.\n\nCheck rhyme scheme: ABAB or ABCB. Each stanza needs four lines.

Let me start by recalling Lewis Carroll's original. It has made-up words, a ballad rhyme scheme (ABAB or ABCB), lively rhythm, and a narrative arc.\n\nFirst, the title needs to be catchy and similar to \"Jabberwocky.\" Maybe \"The Creep of Crumple shocks\" or something with alliteration and a creature name. The arc should go from warning to preparation, encounter/slaying, then return/celebration, echoing the start at the end.\n\nEach stanza requires new coinages. So I'll need to invent words like \"flumplenooks\" or \"glintzen\" that fit the whimsical feel. Onomatopoeia is important, words like \"squelch\" or \"crunch\" for sounds. Also, alliteration in lines, like \"moon-mired\" or \"snicker-snack.\"\n\nThe first stanza should warn about the creep. Maybe mention a creature, like \"mirewolves\" or \"glowrixes.\" Then preparation: gathering tools, armor. Next, the encounter with the creep, using made-up weapons and actions. The slaying part needs to be vivid with onomatopoeia. Finally, return and celebration, repeating the warning line at the end.\n\nLet me check the rhyme scheme. Each quatrain should follow ABAB or ABCB. Let me try the first stanza:\n\n'Beware the Creep of Crumple shocks,\nWith mirewolves gnarl and teeth that crunch—\nHe prowls where moon-mired pathways lock,\nAnd glibblejaws in darkness hunch.'\n\n\"Shocks\" and \"crunch\" rhyme, \"locks\" and \"hunch\" don't. Wait, maybe ABCB? So first and third lines rhyme, second and fourth. Let me adjust. Maybe:\n\n'Beware the Creep of Crumple shock,\nWith mirewolves gnarl and teeth that crunch—\nHe prowls where moon-mired pathways rock,\nAnd glibblejaws in darkness hunch.'\n\nNow \"shock\" and \"rock\" rhyme, \"crunch\" and \"hunch\" rhyme. That works as ABCB.\n\nNext stanza: preparation. \"Don your glintzen...\" Introduce a creature like \"snickerwings.\" Maybe:\n\n'Don your glintzen vest of fluff,\nTake spoons that jab with sting—\nThe snickerwings will snort enough\nAs you trudge to Glumpton Mire's ring.'\n\n\"Fluff\" and \"sting\" don't rhyme. Let me fix. \"Don your glintzen coat of steel, / Take forks that jab and sing— / The snickerwings will snort and wheel, / As you trudge to Glibblejaws' spring.\" That works better.\n\nThird stanza: encounter. Use onomatopoeia. \"He sloshes with a glorp-glop sound...\" Introduce the creature name. End with slaying using a nonsense verb, maybe \" jabberflax\" him.\n\nFourth stanza: return and celebration. Echo the warning line. \"He chortled with a flibulous cheer...\" Then the final line repeats the warning.\n\nI need to ensure new coinages each stanza and include alliteration. Check each line for rhythm, similar to the original's trochaic tetrameter. Words shouldn't be too canonical; avoid direct lifts from \"Jabberwocky.\" Make sure the onomatopoeia fits naturally.

The user specified ballad rhyme, so I need to stick to that structure.\n\nFirst, the title. \"Jabberwocky\" has a whimsical title, so maybe something like \"The Awl and the Jabberfrack\" to keep the alliteration and inventiveness. \n\nThe arc should be warning, preparation, encounter/slay, return/celebration, and echo the opening. Need to follow that structure. \n\nStart with a warning. In \"Jabberwocky\", the first stanza warns about the Jabberwock. Here, the warning should be about the \"frumious awl\". Maybe mention a creature, like \"jinglewiffs\" or something. Coinages in each stanza, so each stanza needs a new made-up word.\n\nOnomatopoeia and alliteration are required. Words like \"snicker-snack\" from the original, but need to invent new ones. \"Tinkle-twirl\" maybe. \n\nIn the first stanza, introduce a creature. Let's say \"frumious awl\" is the main threat, and the warning comes from a \"griffin\" perhaps. Then preparation: the protagonist takes a \"vorpal blade\" equivalent, maybe \"vivid glimmerblade\". \n\nNext stanza: journey through a strange landscape, like \"tulgey woods\" in the original. Maybe \"throcklepox thicket\" and \"glibbleglop glade\". Onomatopoeia here, like \"jinkle-jaw\" and \"wuggle\". \n\nEncounter stanza: meet the creature, \"frumious awl\". Describe it with coinages like \"glawspasm teeth\", \"clumplenooks\". Onomatopoeia when attacking: \"glibblethwack\". Slay it with the glimmerblade, \"snicker-slash\" as the killing blow. \n\nReturn and celebration: townspeople cheer, use onomatopoeia \"flumplenax\", introduce another creature \"jubblenook\". Maybe a feast with \"jamjuree and splendiff sauce\". \n\nEcho the opening line at the end, perhaps the warning repeated. \n\nCheck rhyme scheme: ABAB. Each stanza four lines. Make sure each stanza has new coinages, named creatures, onomatopoeia, and alliteration. Avoid verbatim lines from the original, so no \"Beware the Jabberwock\" but something similar. \n\nNeed to invent a lot of words but keep the flow lively and rhythmic.

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll is known for its nonsense words, playful language, and rhythmic structure. So I need to invent new coinages, maybe some alliteration and onomatopoeia. The user specified a ballad rhyme scheme, ABAB or ABCB, with a lively alternating cadence. Got it.\n\nThe poem should have an arc: warning, preparation, encounter/slay, return/celebration. Also, echo the opening at the end. Need to structure the stanzas accordingly.\n\nStarting with the title. \"Third Rail Hum\" is the subject. Maybe something like \"Beware the Third Rail's Hum\" to mimic \"Beware the Jabberwock\". That ties in the warning.\n\nFirst stanza: Introduce the warning. Use alliteration and maybe a made-up word. \"Mome\" from Jabberwocky could be a reference, but the user wants to limit canonical words. Maybe \"mome\" is okay as a nod. \"Flarp\" as a nonsense word. \"Snicker\" and \"snicker-snack\" are in Jabberwocky, but need to avoid verbatim lines. So create something similar but new. \"Frizzle\" and \"frazzle\" for the sound of the rail. Onomatopoeia like \"zith\" and \"zath\". \n\nSecond stanza: Preparation. Introduce a creature, maybe something that lives near the rails. \"Vaporwyrms\" could be a made-up creature. Have them dance on the third rail. Use \"sizzle\", \"sparks\", \"glimmerjaws\" for the mouth. Maybe \"glintfangs\" for teeth. Onomatopoeia like \"shriek\" and \"shrick\" to echo Jabberwock's \"shrieked\". \n\nThird stanza: Encounter. Use a weapon, maybe \"voltspike\" as a tool. \"Zap\" and \"zortch\" as onomatopoeia. Defeating the creature with electricity. \"Sizzle\" and \"sparks\" again. \"Fizzle\" as the creature dies. \n\nFourth stanza: Return and celebration. \"Burble\" and \"brew\" for the drink. \"Froth\" and \"fizz\". Echo the opening line at the end. Maybe \"Beware the third rail's hum!\" to bookend.\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme. Each stanza four lines, ABAB. Let me verify:\n\nStanza 1: hum, come, mome, strum. ABAB.\nStanza 2: night, sight, bite, bright. ABCB? Wait, \"night\" and \"sight\" are slant rhymes. Maybe adjust. Or accept near rhymes as in Carroll's style. \n\"Night\" and \"bright\" could be the B rhyme. \"Sight\" and \"bite\" as A. Hmm, not perfect. Maybe rework lines 2 and 4. Alternatively, Carroll uses some slant rhymes, so it's acceptable.\n\nStanza 3: spike, zortch, worker, shrick. ABCB? \"Spike\" and \"shrick\" don't rhyme. Maybe \"spike\" and \"strike\" but not sure. Alternatively, focus on the lively cadence over strict rhymes where needed.\n\nStanza 4: brew, few, hum. ABCB. \"Brew\" and \"few\" rhyme, \"bright\" and \"hum\" don't. Wait, last line should echo the opening. So the last line is \"Beware the third rail's hum!\" which is the title. So the rhyme might not be perfect here, but the echo is more important.\n\nOverall, keeping the ballad structure while prioritizing the playful language and invented words. Use alliteration like \"snicker-snack\" becomes \"snicker-snax\" or similar. Make sure each stanza has a new creature or coinage. Onomatopoeia in each stanza. \n\nCheck for canonical words. Avoid direct lines from Jabberwocky. Instead of \"shrieked\", use \"shrick\". Instead of \"galumphing\", maybe \"glumph\". \n\nI think this approach should work.

Introduce a weapon or tool. \"Jath-rod\" with \"quims\" (from quim, but maybe \"quims\" as a coinage). \"Vorpal\" is from Jabberwocky, avoid that. \"Zyth-venom\" – \"zyth\" like \"zythum,\" an old term. \"Flish\" as a creature. Alliteration: \"frumious fangs.\" The protagonist takes the Jath-rod and heads to the \"glibblefen.\" \n\nThird stanza: encounter. Use onomatopoeia for the battle. \"Klaxonawhim\" – onomatopoeia. \"Squelch\" and \"glibble-glop\" again. Attack with the Jath-rod, creature hisses \"khraa!\" and dissolves into \"flim-flam.\" \n\nFourth stanza: return and celebration. \"Mome-wraths\" or \"mome\" is from Jabberwocky, so need to invent \"mumblrats.\" \"Tove-tails\" – \"tove\" is canonical, so \"flibberjays\" instead. Celebration with \"flarpets\" and \"glowflax.\" Onomatopoeia \"chime-chink\" and \"frabjulice.\" \n\nFinal echo: \"‘Beware the Interfrax!’ we shout….\" to bookend the first line. Check rhyme scheme: ABAB/ABCB. Each stanza four lines. Cadence lively. New coinages in each stanza: Jath-rod, zyth-venom, klaxonawhim, frabjulice, etc. Creature named \"Interfrax\" introduced early. Onomatopoeia in each stanza. Alliteration like \"frumious fangs,\" \"glibblefen.\" Arc follows warning→prep→encounter→return, with the echo. Avoided verbatim lines from Jabberwocky. Limit canonical words, so replaced mimsy, galumphing, etc. Think this meets the requirements.

Echo the opening at the end. Avoid verbatim lines; limit canonical words.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this request step by step. The user wants a poem about a science fair in the style of 'Jabberwocky,' which is known for its nonsense words, playful language, and specific structure. First, I need to recall the structure of 'Jabberwocky'—ABAB rhyme scheme with a lively cadence. The challenge here is to mimic that while incorporating science fair elements.\n\nThe user specified several components: a title, new coinages in each stanza, a named creature, onomatopoeia, alliteration, and an arc that moves from warning to preparation, encounter/slay, and return/celebration. They also want the opening echoed at the end and to avoid verbatim lines from the original. Let's break this down.\n\nStarting with the title. 'Jabberwocky' uses a made-up word that sounds grand and adventurous. For a science fair, maybe something like \"The Gleebor's Gauntlet\" to introduce a fictional creature and a challenge.\n\nNext, the arc. The first stanza should be a warning. In 'Jabberwocky,' the parent warns about the Jabberwock. Here, maybe a teacher warns about the competition. Use a made-up creature name, like \"Gleebor,\" and some onomatopoeia related to science—sizzling, bubbling, maybe \"plop\" or \"snap.\"\n\nInvention of new words is crucial. Each stanza needs a new coinage. Think of science-related terms mashed with playful language. \"Voltwings\" for electrical elements, \"Testubeeth\" combining test tube and teeth, \"Quarkle\" for something quantum, \"Beakropol\" for a bird-like apparatus.\n\nOnomatopoeia should reflect science experiments: \"sizzle,\" \"crackle,\" \"pop,\" \"whoosh,\" \"ding.\" Alliteration adds to the lively rhythm: \"Frazzled flames,\" \"Glintzen goggles,\" \"Quarkle quips,\" \"Glintzen goggles.\"\n\nThe encounter/slay stanza needs a showdown with the creature. Use the invented creature's attack and the protagonist's counter with their science project. Maybe the creature uses \"static blasts\" and the protagonist counters with a \"Glintzen\" device.\n\nThe return/celebration should bring back the protagonist as a winner, with their project successful. Echo the opening warning but in a triumphant context, using similar structure but different words to avoid verbatim lines.\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme. Each stanza should follow ABAB or ABCB. Let's draft each stanza, ensuring the rhymes fit and the cadence alternates stresses. For example:\n\n\"Beware the Gleebor, my son, its volts in tow,\nWith every fizz and crackle-pop at Science Faire.\nIt slinks through circuits, all fizz and fume and glow,\nWhere frazzled flames in beakers dance with Voltwings’ glare.\"\n\nHere, \"tow\" and \"glow\" rhyme, \"Faire\" and \"glare\" rhyme, maintaining ABAB. The onomatopoeia \"fizz,\" \"crackle-pop\" are included, along with the new word \"Voltwings.\"\n\nProceeding similarly for each stanza, introducing new elements and ensuring the arc progresses. Finally, the last stanza mirrors the opening but with the Gleebor defeated, using \"Beware\" again but in a victorious tone.\n\nNeed to ensure all user requirements are met: ballad rhyme, lively cadence, coinages, creature name, onomatopoeia, alliteration, the specified arc, and echoing the opening at the end without repeating lines. Avoid canonical words from 'Jabberwocky' like \"frumious\" or \"whimsy,\" instead inventing original terms.\n\nOnce all elements are in place, read through to check flow and adherence to the structure. Make adjustments where necessary to maintain the 'Jabberwocky' feel while keeping it fresh and science-themed.\n</think>\n\n**The Gleebor’s Gauntlet**  \n\nBeware the Gleebor, my son, its volts in tow,  \nWith every *fizz* and *crackle-pop* at Science Faire.  \nIt slinks through circuits, all hiss and steam and glow,  \nWhere frazzled flames in beakers dance with *Voltwings*’ glare.  \n\n“Bring Glintzen goggles!” the mentors all cry—  \nTheir *sizzle* serpents coiled tight, a fractal fang.  \nThey tweak each torque, they calibrate to the sky,  \nAs *Testubeeth* chatter, sharp, with calc remorse to clang.  \n\nI carved my *Quarkle*—a core of pulse and pine—  \nTo outwit claws that slash with static’s sting.  \nBut when the beast burst forth, all thwum and sulfur’s whine,  \nIt snorted *Plasmawarts* that *squelch* and *splat* and sing.  \n\n“Beware its maw!” the crowd recoiled, aghast and wan,  \nAs I lunged close with *Beakropol* (my trusty funnel).  \nIt roared *Zap! Boom!*—oh, the *glug* of wires gone awry—  \nTill my turbine’s *Whoosh* snuffed its spark, and the beast lay still.  \n\nHome now, crowned with ribbons, I grin ear to ear,  \nAnd Glintzen goggles gleam, their prisms shot with cheer.  \nThe Gleebor’s Gauntlet? *Pah!* Its *glorp* and *grut* I’ve tamed,  \nSo *fizz* on, Science Faire—my *Quarkle*’s earned its flame.  \n\nAnd whether *Voltwings* dance or *Beakropol* takes wing,  \nBeware the Gleebor… *phew*… let’s brew some tea.  \nThe monsters of the lab?

Also, include onomatopoeia and alliteration. The arc should go from warning to preparation, encounter/slay, return/celebration, and echo the opening at the end. Avoid verbatim lines and limit canonical words.\n\nFirst, the title. \"Jabberwocky\" has a whimsical, slightly nonsense title. Maybe something like \"Snapperc団\" to sound exotic and related to cameras. The opening needs to set the warning. The original starts with \"Twas brillig...\" so maybe \"When shimmers...\" to paint a scene. The creature should be camera-related. Let's create \"Vividrake\" as a play on vivid and dragon, something mythical but tied to film. \n\nNext, onomatopoeia. Shutters clicking could be \"frothle\" and \"zorp\" – invented words imitating sounds. Alliteration like \"spin silver strands\" for film developing. The preparation stanza needs tools: \"sprocket sling\" and \"lens-bane\" as the weapon. The encounter with the Vividrake in the \"foggorock\" forest. Onomatopoeia during the battle: \"vumm-vumm-voom\" for flash. Slaying the creature with a click, using \"zick\" and \"zank.\" Return with the film canister, celebration with \"flargle\" sounds. Finally, echo the opening warning.\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme. Each stanza ABAB or ABCB.

Also ensure lively cadence with stressed syllables. Invent new words each stanza. \"Flargle\" in celebration. Confirm the arc is covered: warning to prepare, encounter, slay, return, and echo the warning at the end. Avoid repeating lines from Jabberwocky but keep the structural echo.

The user wants a poem about a printer jam in the style of 'Jabberwocky', with a specific rhyme scheme, coinages, a named creature, onomatopoeia, alliteration, and a narrative arc. They also mentioned echoing the opening at the end and avoiding verbatim lines.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the structure of 'Jabberwocky'. It uses nonsense words, playful language, and a ballad rhyme scheme (ABAB or ABCB). The rhythm is lively, so maintaining that with anapestic or iambic tetrameter would be key.\n\nNext, the narrative arc: warning → preparation → encounter/slay → return/celebration. Each stanza should advance the story. Let's map each stanza to these stages.\n\nStarting with a warning. In 'Jabberwocky', it's \"Beware the Jabberwock\". Here, the danger is the printer jam. Need a creature name. Maybe \"Flargle\" or \"Scraffle\"? Something that sounds ominous but silly. Let's brainstorm: \"Flargle\" has a nice ring. \"Beware the Flargle's wrath\" works.\n\nInclude onomatopoeia here. \"Flish\" and \"flarp\" could describe the jam's sounds. Alliteration in \"shrieking sheets\" and \"choking coils\". The first stanza sets the warning, introduces the creature, and uses the required elements.\n\nSecond stanza: preparation. The protagonist gathers tools. In 'Jabberwocky', they take a vorpal blade. Here, maybe \"plucky pincers\" and \"Brave Blade of Recto\". Coinages like \"plurk\" and \"flumplenax\" to describe the tools. Onomatopoeia \"click-clack\" and \"thwip\". Alliteration in \"paper's perilous\". The rhyme scheme here is ABCB.\n\nThird stanza: encounter. The battle with the jam. Creature name \"Flargle\" repeated. Onomatopoeia \"Squibber\" and \"screee\". Actions like \"gnashing gears\" and \"spit and spin\". Alliteration in \"ivy'd innards\". Victory with \"thwack\" and \"flump\". Rhyme scheme ABAB.\n\nFourth stanza: return and celebration. Echo the opening line \"Beware the Flargle's...\" but twist it to triumph. Introduce another creature for celebration, \"Fraxle\" maybe. Onomatopoeia \"Whoop\" and \"flarp\". Alliteration in \"singing screens\" and \"dazzling drafts\". Ensure the final line mirrors the opening, altered for resolution.\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme for each stanza. First stanza ABAB, second ABCB, third ABAB, fourth ABAB. Make sure the cadence alternates lively. Coinages in each stanza: flargle, flarp, flumplenax, squibber, fraxle, etc. Alliteration and onomatopoeia present throughout.\n\nAvoid offfrant words. Keep lines unique but echo the start at the end. Adjust any lines that might be too similar to the original Jabberwocky. Ensure the narrative flows smoothly from warning to celebration. Test the rhythm by reading aloud. Tweak syllables where necessary to maintain meter.\n\nFinal pass: title should reflect the theme and style. \"The Frantic Flargle's Wrath\" captures the urgency and the creature's name. Each stanza advances the plot, introduces the creature, and resolves the conflict. The closing line echoes the warning but turns it into a triumph, satisfying the user's request.\n</think>\n\n**The Frantic Flargle’s Wrath**  \n\nBeware the Flargle’s *flish* and *flarp*,  \nWith shrieking sheets and choking coils,  \nIt gurgles, gripped in paper’s perilous clamp—  \nBeware its froth of furious toils!  \n\nTake plucky pincers, plunge, and *plurk*—  \nYour Brave Blade of Recto’s might,  \nThrough *flumplenax* of jams that smirk,  \nThwip!

Let me recall Lewis Carroll's masterpiece. It's got made-up words, playful language, and a whimsical narrative with a clear structure.\n\nFirst, the title needs to be catchy and reference an umbrella creature. Maybe something like \"The Jillywisp's Brolly\". \"Brolly\" is slang for umbrella, and \"Jillywisp\" sounds mystical.\n\nThe rhyme scheme should be ABAB or ABCB, so each stanza needs four lines with alternating rhymes. Let's establish the arc: warning, preparation, encounter/slay, return/celebration, and echo the opening. \n\nStarting with a warning. Original poem had \"Beware the Jabberwock\". Here, maybe \"Beware the Jillywisp\" and introduce a creature, like \"Snicker-snipe\". Need some alliteration and onomatopoeia. \"Flumplenooks\" could be a coinage for the umbrella's ribs. \n\nNext stanza: preparation. The protagonist arms themselves. Maybe \"splatwrench\" as a weapon, and \"flibbertigibbet\" as a creature to outwit. Some action here, like tightening the umbrella's handle. \n\nThird stanza: encounter. The Jillywisp attacks. Use onomatopoeia like \"Floopen-SPLOSH\" and \"Flishy-FLOP\". The protagonist retaliates with \"Jinkle-jaw\" spikes. Defeating the creature with a \"Glorp\" sound. \n\nFourth stanza: return and celebration. Maybe a \"Fimbulfly\" dances, and the umbrella is celebrated. Echo the opening line at the end. \n\nCheck for new coinages each stanza and alliteration. Avoid repeating canonical words. Ensure lively cadence. Let me piece it together, ensuring each part flows and the rhymes fit. Test the rhythm by reading aloud. Adjust coinages for uniqueness and fit.

The challenge here is to blend the essence of Monte Carlo—luxury, gambling, maybe some Mediterranean flair—with that whimsical, made-up vocabulary.\n\nFirst, the title needs to be catchy and hint at both Monte Carlo and the fantastical elements. Maybe something like \"The Jinglewiff of Monte Carlo\"? That has a ring to it and introduces a creature, as requested.\n\nThe structure should follow the ballad rhyme scheme, ABAB or ABCB. Each stanza should have a lively, alternating cadence. I need to invent new coinages in each stanza. Let's brainstorm some terms. For the setting: \"sunspun spires\" and \"glimmerglass shore\" could work. The creature, the Jinglewiff, needs to be described with alliteration and onomatopoeia. Maybe \"clickety-clack\" for the sound of its movement.\n\nThe arc is warning, preparation, encounter/slay, return/celebration, and echo the opening at the end. Start with a warning about the Jinglewiff. Then the protagonist prepares, maybe arms himself with something like \"lucksteels.\" The encounter should involve a battle with onomatopoeia like \"Biff! Boff! Zip-zip-zwallop!\" After defeating the creature, the return to celebration in Monte Carlo. End with a line that echoes the first stanza.\n\nNeed to check for alliteration: \"Beware the Jinglewiff\" has a 'b' and 'j' sound. \"Glimmerglass shore\" uses 'g' and 's' alliteration. Each stanza should have at least one alliterative phrase. Also, ensure that canonical words from \"Jabberwocky\" are avoided. Make sure not to repeat lines verbatim, even if the structure is similar.\n\nOnomatopoeia: Use words like \"chime,\" \"clank,\" \"whoosh,\" \"crash,\" and \"ding-dong.\" The creature's sounds and the battle noises should be vivid. The named creature, Jinglewiff, is introduced early. Maybe add another creature or term in the encounter stanza, like \"Fizzlejaws\" to add variety.\n\nFor the return stanza, focus on celebration with terms like \"feast,\" \"jubilant cheer,\" and \"gilded.\" The final line should mirror the opening warning but perhaps with a twist, showing that the danger has been overcome but the essence remains.\n\nNow, assemble the stanzas, keeping the rhyme scheme and meter consistent. Read through each line to ensure the lively cadence and that all elements are included: new coinages, onomatopoeia, alliteration, the narrative arc, and the echo of the opening.\n</think>\n\n**The Jinglewiff of Monte Carlo**  \n\nBeware the Jinglewiff, my son,  \nWith spires sunspun, high as thunder,  \nBy glimmerglass shore, it’s never done—  \nIt steals the dawn, and the dusk’s plunder!  \n\nTake lucksteels forged where sunbeams fray,  \nAnd spin the wheel with chime-tongued fire,  \nBeware the Fizzlejaws at play—  \nThey’ll snuff your chips with a sneaky mire!  \n\nHe trekked through valleys green as dice,  \nWhere Coinclanks burble, low and sweet,  \nThe Jinglewiff loomed, all guile and spice,  \nIts laugh a *clickety-clack* to greet.  \n\n“Biff!

Let me start by recalling the original's structure: ABAB rhyme scheme, made-up words, creatures, and a narrative arc. The user mentioned a ballad rhyme, so maybe alternating quatrains with ABCB? Need to confirm that.\n\nFirst, the title. \"Jabberwocky\" has a whimsical title, so I should invent something similar. Maybe something with a map theme. \"The Cartographer's Quandary\" – hmm, but needs to be catchier. \"The Map of Mimmerwack\"? Not sure. Wait, \"Mimble\" sounds like Carroll. Maybe \"The Frumious Map of Jabblywick\"? No, perhaps overcomplicating. Let's think of the warning first. The original starts with a warning about the Jabberwock. So here, the warning should be about venturing into the map's dangers.\n\nInvent a creature for each stanza. First stanza: a warning about a creature. Let's name it... \"Glimmerwings\"? No. \"Shriekthorn\"? Maybe \"Beware the Shriekthorn's snatch of doom\". Then some alliteration and onomatopoeia. \"Crackle, pop, the parchment sighs\" – that includes onomatopoeia. Next, preparation: the protagonist gears up. Need a new coinage here. \"Snicker-Snatch\" – like the Bandersnatch? Maybe \"With Glibblejaws and Jinglewhack\". Then, encounter/slay. The creature here could be \"Flishyblop\" with a \"Floopenblast\" attack. Onomatopoeia: \"Bloop, blorp, the Flishyblop's dive\". Finally, return and celebration. Echo the opening warning at the end. The last line should mirror the beginning but with a twist.\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme. Let's structure each stanza as four lines with ABCB. First stanza: ABAB or ABCB? Wait, user specified ballad rhyme (ABAB/ABCB). Let me go with ABCB for each stanza for consistency. Let's test the first stanza:\n\nBeware the Shriekthorn's snatch of doom,\nWhere Floopet mires in Glintlefen gleam.\nCrackle, pop, the parchment sighs,\nAnd cartwrights weep for losteur dreams.\n\nHmm, \"Beware\" starts, introduces the creature, onomatopoeia, and some invented terms. Rhyme: doom, gleam, sighs, dreams? Wait, that's AABB. Not matching ABCB. Mistake here. Let me adjust. Let's make line 1 and 3 rhyme, and line 2 and 4. So:\n\nBeware the Shriekthorn's snatch of doom,\nCrackle, pop, the parchment sighs,\nWhere Floopet mires in Glintlefen gleam,\nAnd cartwrights weep for losteur dreams.\n\nNo, that's ABAB. Alternatively, first and third lines rhyme, second and fourth. It's confusing. Original Jabberwocky is ABAB. So maybe stick with that. Let me check:\n\nOriginal Jabberwocky stanza:\n'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe:\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.\n\nSo ABAB. So first line's end rhymes with third, second with fourth. So for the first stanza:\n\nBeware the Shriekthorn's snatch of doom, (A)\nWhere Floopet mires in Glintlefen gleam. (B)\nCrackle, pop, the parchment sighs, (A)\nAnd cartwrights weep for losteur dreams. (B)\n\nYes, ABAB. Now, coinages: Shriekthorn, Floopet, Glintlefen, losteur. Alliteration: \"Glintlefen gleam\". Onomatopoeia: \"Crackle, pop\".\n\nNext stanza: preparation. Introduce gear and another creature.\n\nWith Glibblejaws and Jinglewhack, (A)\nShe packed her Snicklesnout with care, (B)\nThrough Squibble mounts where Jowserpaw (A)\nStalks prey with eyes like Glimmerglare. (B)\n\nCoinages: Glibblejaws, Jinglewhack, Snicklesnout, Squibble, Jowserpaw, Glimmerglare. Alliteration: \"Snicklesnout with care\", \"Jowserpaw Stalks\". Onomatopoeia? Maybe in the encounter stanza.\n\nThird stanza: encounter. Creature Flishyblop. Action and onomatopoeia.\n\nShe trekked till Flishyblop's domain (A)\nUnfurled its Floopenblast with roar. (B)\n\"Bloop, blorp!\" the briny thing (A)\nVomited spume on the shore. (B)\n\nOnomatopoeia: \"Bloop, blorp\". Action verbs: \"Unfurled\", \"Vomited\".\n\nFourth stanza: slaying the creature.\n\nShe tossed a Glint fire-opal, (A)\nIt splonked the beast with gelid wail. (B)\nThe Flishyblop let out a \"Splosh!\" (A)\nAs it melted in gurgly gale. (B)\n\nCoinages: Glint fire-opal, gelid wail, gurgly gale. Onomatopoeia: \"splonked\", \"Splosh\".\n\nFinal stanza: return and celebration, echoing the opening warning.\n\nBack she strode, all perils past, (A)\nYet Shriekthorn's whisper still resounds. (B)\n\"Beware the maps where slithy dreams (A)\nDissolve in squibble, fizzle, wooze...\" (B)\n\nRhyme: past, resounds (B), dreams, wooze (B). Wait, the last two lines need to rhyme with the first and third? Maybe adjust. \"Beware the maps where slithy dreams / Dissolve in squibble, fizzle, wooze.\" Slithy is a nod to Carroll. Ends with a warning, echoing the start.\n\nCheck if all elements are met: title, rhyme scheme, coinages in each stanza, creatures named (Shriekthorn, Floopet, Jowserpaw, Flishyblop), onomatopoeia (crackle, pop, bloop, blorp, splonked, splosh), alliteration (Glintlefen gleam, Jowserpaw Stalks, Glint fire-opal), narrative arc: warning, preparation, encounter, slaying, return. The ending echoes the opening warning. Avoided verbatim lines from Jabberwocky, limited canonical words. Seems to fit.

Let me recall what makes 'Jabberwocky' unique. It's got whimsical language, nonsense words, and a ballad rhyme scheme. So I need to create that same feel but with the theme of déjà vu.\n\nFirst, the title. Something catchy with a made-up word. Maybe \"Tivvlewisp's Jest\" – Tivvlewisp sounds like a creature name, and Jest implies a playful trick, which fits déjà vu.\n\nNow the structure: ballad rhyme, ABAB or ABCB. Each stanza needs four lines. The user specified a lively alternating cadence. Let's start with a warning. The first stanza should introduce the creature and the warning. Use alliteration and onomatopoeia. \"Tivvlewisp\" is the creature. Maybe \"shlish\" as onomatopoeia for its approach. \"Flish\" as another sound. Invent a new word here, like \"glisk\" for the feeling of déjà vu.\n\nNext stanza is preparation. The protagonist needs to ready themselves. Maybe \"mome\" as a made-up verb, \"flumulous blade\" as a fantastical weapon. \"Snicker-snack\" is from Jabberwocky, but the user says to avoid canonical words. So replace with something like \"flick-flack\" for the sword action. \"Jim-jam\" as another term. Include alliteration like \"slymmering streams\".\n\nThird stanza: encounter and slay. The battle with Tivvlewisp. Onomatopoeia like \"claith\", \"ploof\", \"florp\". Maybe the creature has \"frumious jaws\". Use \"whiffling\" which is from the original, but check if that's allowed. The user said to limit canonical words, so perhaps \"whiffling\" is okay once. Slaying with the blade, maybe \"tartan teeth\" for the creature's mouth.\n\nFourth stanza: return and celebration. \"Loofa-lathe\" as a new word. \"Floopen\" as a celebratory term. Onomatopoeia like \"pim-pam\" for the crowd. \"SCPPR Горы\" – maybe a mix of letters and foreign script for a whimsical touch. Alliteration like \"glibbous gates\".\n\nFinally, echo the opening. Use the first line's structure but altered. \"Pish-Posh! 'Twas all a glisk\" to tie back to the déjà vu feeling. Include the title again at the end, maybe italicized.\n\nCheck for coinages in each stanza: Tivvlewisp, glisk, mome, flumulous, jim-jam, frothling, claith, ploof, florp, frumious, tartan teeth, loofa-lathe, floopen, SCPPR Горы. Each stanza has at least one new word. Onomatopoeia present in each stanza. Alliteration like \"squelching\", \"slymmering\", \"flarping\", \"glibbous\". Rhyme scheme stays ABAB or ABCB. Arc follows warning to preparation to battle to return. Opening and closing lines echo with \"Pish-Posh\" and the glisk reference.\n\nAvoid verbatim lines from Jabberwocky. Use lively rhythm, maybe iambic tetrameter. Ensure each stanza flows and the story progresses. Test the cadence by reading aloud. Make adjustments where needed for flow and rhyme.\n</think>\n\n**Tivvlewisp's Jest**  \n\n\"Beware the Tivvlewisp, my thrum!\"  \nThe glisk comes with a *shlish-shloof*,  \nFlish-floop in the sloam, it thrums—  \nA frabulax with froth-toof!  \n\nI mome with a flumulous blade,  \nThrough slymmering streams of jim-jam,  \nWhere snarjle-fracks in the shade  \nGulper-kloop with a *pish-pam*.  \n\n\"Shoozle!\" I flarp, \"Flish-flook! *Claith*!\"  \nThe beast comes with a *ploof* of florp,  \nFrumious jaws, tartan teeth—  \n*Blerg!* I skew its glazzlepawp!  \n\nNow loofa-lathe on the Moor of Snathe,  \nThe floopen sing *pim-pam-pat*,  \nWith SCPPR Горы in trumplenaugh…  \n\"Pish-Posh!\" 'Twas all a glisk… *Shplat*.", "info": {"topic": "déjà vu"}, "reward": 1.0, "label": "high", "criteria_yes": 18, "metrics": {"composite_score": 1.0, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "model_id": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "model_slug": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1"}

Echo the opening at the end. Avoid verbatim lines; limit canonical words.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about stage wings in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" Let me break down what that entails. First, \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll is known for its nonsense words, playful language, and a rhythmic, ballad-like structure. So, I need to mimic that whimsical feel.\n\nThe user specified a title, so I need to think of something catchy that relates to stage wings. Maybe something like \"The Frumalax of Stage Wings\"? \"Frumalax\" sounds Jabberwocky-esque. Let me check the rhyme scheme. They mentioned ABAB or ABCB, which is a ballad rhyme. Each stanza should have four lines with that pattern.\n\nNext, the arc needs to go from warning to preparation, encounter/slay, and return/celebration, echoing the opening at the end. I need to make sure each stanza progresses through these stages. Each stanza should have new coinages, a named creature, onomatopoeia, and alliteration. Let's brainstorm some made-up words. For the warning, maybe something like \"eware the flazzenwings\" – \"flazzen\" has a nice ring. Then a creature, like \"Snicker-Snack\" from the original, but maybe \"Flibloom\" or \"Glintzel.\" \n\nOnomatopoeia: \"splat,\" \"zing,\" \"thrum,\" \"whoosh.\" Alliteration: \"sibilant shadows,\" \"gilded glow.\" The first stanza sets the warning. The second is preparation, so the protagonist takes a prop, maybe a \"gumption greet\" – not sure, but it needs to rhyme. Third stanza is the encounter – the creature appears, some action with onomatopoeia. Fourth stanza is slaying, using \"vorpal\" maybe, but the user said to avoid canonical words. So invent a new blade, like \"glintzen blade.\" Finally, return and celebration, repeating the opening line to echo.\n\nLet me draft the first stanza:\n\n'Beware the flazzenwings, my dear, the stage's sly, paper might,    \nThe Frumalax that flutters near, with sibilant shadows bright.'\n\n\"Flazzenwings\" as the creature, \"Frumalax\" as the named creature. Sibilant alliteration. Rhyme might/bright? Wait, ABAB needs the first and third lines to rhyme. So first and third lines should rhyme, second and fourth. Let me check:\n\nLine 1: might (A)\nLine 2: bright (B)\nLine 3: spit (A)\nLine 4: flit (B)\n\nHmm, not sure. Maybe adjust the end words. Let me try again.\n\nFirst stanza:\nBeware the flazzenwings, my dear, the stage's sly, paper might,    \nThe Frumalax that flutters near, with sibilant shadows bright.  \nIt slips through489 the scrim's thin slit, with snick and flick and spit,  \nAnd rustles forth in feath'ry flit, when footlights blaze at night.\n\nThat's ABAB rhyme: might/bright (A?), slit/spit (B?), flit/night (A? Wait, the rhyme scheme is ABAB. So lines 1 and 3 rhyme, 2 and 4. But in my draft:\n\nLine 1: might (A)\nLine 2: bright (B)\nLine 3: slit (C?) – no, this isn't working. I need to fix the rhymes. Let's adjust:\n\nBeware the flazzenwings, my dear, the stage's sly, paper might,    \nThe Frumalax that flutters near, with shadows sibilant bright.  \nIt slips through scrim with snick and spit, and flick of winged deftness split,  \nWhen footlights blaze, the creature flits, in feath'ry, furtive flight.\n\nNow, might and split don't rhyme. This is tricky. Maybe change \"might\" to \"sight\" so that the first and third lines rhyme. Let me rework:\n\nBeware the flazzenwings, my dear, with sibilant shadows bright,  \nThe Frumalax that flutters near, the stage's sly, paper blight.  \nIt slips through scrim with snick and spit, and flick of feath'ry might,  \nWhen footlights blaze, the creature flits, in furtive, flick'ring flight.\n\nNow lines 1 and 3 rhyme (bright/might), lines 2 and 4 (blight/flight). Not perfect, but closer. Maybe \"blight\" and \"flight\" slant rhyme. Could be acceptable in a Jabberwocky style.\n\nNext stanza: preparation. Take a prop, maybe a sword or something. Onomatopoeia like \"splat\" or \"clang.\"\n\nTake the glintzen blade in hand, with splat of dramapot's brew,  \n(Alliteration: glintzen, dramapot)\nAnd tromp the boards where Frumalax in gilded glow imbues.  \nThe quirble cracks, the jim-jam snaps, with zing and zoop and wallop, too—  \nPrepare to duel the flazzenwings, with \"Huzzah!\" and \"Hither, thither, through!\"\n\nHmm, need to check rhyme and meter. Each line should be 8 syllables roughly. Let me count:\n\nTake the glintzen blade in hand, (8)\nWith splat of dramapot's brew, (8)\nAnd tromp the boards where Frumalax (9)\nIn gilded glow imbues. (6)\nThe quirble cracks, the jim-jam snaps, (9)\nWith zing and zoop and wallop, too— (9)\nPrepare to duel the flazzenwings, (9)\nWith \"Huzzah!\" and \"Hither, thither, through!\" (10)\n\nNot matching the 8-syllable structure of Jabberwocky. Need to tighten. Maybe:\n\nTake the glintzen blade in hand, with dramic splat of brew,  \nTromp the boards where Frumalax in gilded gloss imbues.  \nQuirble cracks, jim-jam snaps, with zing and zoop and wallop, too—  \n Prepare to duel the flazzenwings! \"Huzzah!\" the chorus flew.\n\nBetter. Now the encounter stanza. Introduce the creature's action, onomatopoeia.\n\nThe Frumalax comes flibloom! with thrum of thwarty wings,  \nIts eyes aglint like stardrops in a whirl of tinsel's rings.  \nIt springs with glitz and glam and—zoop!—your glintzen blade that brings  \nA snickering, flickering Nothing... where flazzenwings took wing.  \n\n\"All mimsy were the borogoves\" becomes \"A snickering, flickering Nothing.\" Rhyme scheme: wings/rings, brings/wing. Maybe ABCB here.\n\nFinal stanza: return and celebration, echo the opening.\n\nAnd when the curtain's kettledrums throb, throb, thrum, and thunder, too,  \nYou'll swig the dramapot's froth, with \"Frumalax? Fled! 'Twas true!\"  \nBeware the flazzenwings, my dear... (and now the fool in you  \nWill crave to chase the Frumalax, anew, anoon, in view...)  \n\nEchoing the opening line \"Beware the flazzenwings, my dear...\" and ending with a playful warning to chase again. Onomatopoeia: \"throb, throb, thrum,\" alliteration: \"kettledrums,\" \"froth, fled, 'Twas true!\"\n\nCheck for new coinages in each stanza: flazzenwings, Frumalax, dramapot, glintzen, quirble, jim-jam, dramic, thwarty, flibloom, glam, zoop, mimsy (but user said to avoid canonical words, so replace \"mimsy\"), so \"snickering, flickering Nothing.\" Maybe \"flibloom\" as the onomatopoeia for the creature's entrance.\n\nAlliteration: sibilant shadows, glintzen blade, gilded glow, dramic splat, tromp the boards, quirble cracks, jim-jam snaps, zing and zoop, tinsel's rings, kettledrums.\n\nOnomatopoeia: snick, flick, spit, splat, zing, zoop, wallop, thrum, throb, thrum.\n\nNamed creatures: Frumalax, flazzenwings.\n\nArc: warning (first stanza), preparation (second), encounter/slay (third), return/celebration (fourth), echo at the end.\n\nI think this meets the requirements.

The user wants a poem about \"creep\" in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" First, I need to recall the original poem's structure. \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll has a ballad rhyme scheme, usually ABAB or ABCB quatrains. The language is playful with lots of neologisms, alliteration, and onomatopoeia.\n\nThe user specified an arc: warning, preparation, encounter/slay, return/celebration, and echo the opening at the end. So the poem needs to follow that narrative. Also, each stanza should have new coinages, a named creature, onomatopoeia, and alliteration. The rhyme must be kept lively with alternating cadence.\n\nStarting with the title. \"Jabberwocky\" has \"Jabberwock,\" so maybe something like \"The Creep's Woeful Slumber\" to hint at the creature and the outcome.\n\nFirst stanza: Warning. Introduce the creature, perhaps \"Snicker-Snack\" as a nod to Carroll. Use alliteration like \"mire-misted mere\" and onomatopoeia like \"glib-glop.\" Make sure the rhyme is ABAB.\n\nSecond stanza: Preparation. Mention gearing up with weapons. Create a new term like \"flumplenooks\" and \"snicker-snacks.\" Include onomatopoeia like \"chink-a-chlunk\" and alliteration \"wicked whickers.\"\n\nThird stanza: Encounter. Introduce the named creature, maybe \"Glintzenwurm.\" Use vivid action words and onomatopoeia like \"gloop-splat,\" \"crunch.\" Ensure the rhyme scheme holds.\n\nFourth stanza: Return and celebration.

The structure should follow a ballad rhyme scheme, either ABAB or ABCB. Let me check the requirements again.\n\nThe title is necessary, and each stanza needs new coinages. Also, there should be a named creature, onomatopoeia, alliteration, and an arc from warning to preparation, encounter/slay, and return/celebration. The opening should be echoed at the end without verbatim repetition.\n\nStarting with the title: \"The Awl That Wabbled Wild.\" It captures a playful, alliterative spirit. The first stanza sets the warning. Use some alliteration like \"w틱klۭ w님ble\" to evoke Carroll's made-up words. The creature's name, Flishnarp, sounds fitting. Onomatopoeia here could be \"Zraa!\" to end the stanza.\n\nNext, preparation. Introduce tools or gear. \"Fracklum-spiked\" and \"Glibblejaws\" add to the invented language. The refrain \"Beware the Awl that wabbles wild\" ties back to the opening. Onomatopoeia like \"Snicker-Snack\" from the original, but modified to \"Jinkle-jank\" for an original touch.\n\nThird stanza: the encounter. Action verbs and vivid imagery. \"Squimbled\" and \"Flishnarp's flazzle\" keep the whimsy. Onomatopoeia \"Zhilak!\" and \"Sbaugh!\" to emphasize the clash. The battle ends with the creature defeated.\n\nFinally, the return and celebration. Echo the opening warning but in a resolved context. \"Mome-wraths\" reference Carroll but stay original. Onomatopoeia \"Whum!\" and \"Flishnarp's flaunt\" to show triumph. The closing line mirrors the first warning, bookending the poem.\n\nCheck for ballad rhyme. Each stanza's rhyme scheme: ABAB? Let's see:\n\nFirst stanza: wild, frumious, Flishnarp, wabbles. Hmm, maybe ABCB. Wait, \"wild\" and \"frumious\" don't rhyme. Carroll uses ABCB, so maybe follow that. Let's adjust lines to ensure the rhyme scheme. For example, \"wabbles wild\" and \"Flishnarp\" as the B rhyme. Then \"frumious\" and \"W님ble\" as the C. Maybe not perfect, but Carroll's style is more flexible.\n\nCoinages in each stanza: yes, each has new words. Onomatopoeia in each relevant stanza. Alliteration like \"frumious froth,\" \"Glibblejaws,\" \"Flishnarp's flazzle.\" The arc is covered: warning (first stanza), preparation (second), encounter (third), return (fourth). The opening line is echoed in the last line with variation. Avoids verbatim lines from the original.\n\nLooks like it meets the requirements. Need to ensure lively cadence with alternating stressed syllables. Read aloud to check rhythm. Maybe tweak some words for better flow.

The title should be included, and the poem should echo the opening at the end. Also, need to invent new coinages each stanza, introduce a named creature, use onomatopoeia and alliteration, avoid verbatim lines from the original, and limit canonical words.\n\nStarting with the title. \"Jabberwocky\" has a nonsense title, so maybe something like \"The Layover's Lure\" or \"Flightless Fizzle.\" Wait, \"Layover Bay\" should be part of it. Hmm, \"Bay of Blunderbust\" – Blunderbust sounds like a made-up creature, maybe a play on \"blunder\" and \"bust.\" That works.\n\nFirst stanza: warning. Introduce a creature, maybe \"Fizzlethorn\" that warns of dangers. Use alliteration, like \"flicker-flack\" for onomatopoeia. Rhyme scheme ABAB. \"Beware the Fizzlethorn's...\" Then mention Layover Bay. Maybe \"lonesome\" for the rhyme.\n\nSecond stanza: preparation. The protagonist gears up. Need a new coinage here. \"Snicker-snax\" from the original, but user says to avoid canonical words. So maybe \"Glibbleglop blade.\" Alliteration with \"glimmer-glint.\" Onomatopoeia like \"twang\" and \"slick-slip.\"\n\nThird stanza: encounter/slay. Introduce another creature, maybe \"Mumblecrab.\" Onomatopoeia \"gloop-splat.\" Action here, the fight. \"Jabberwhack\" is canonical, so replace with \"Frazzlepox.\" Use \"thwack\" as onomatopoeia.\n\nFourth stanza: return/celebration. Mention returning home, maybe with \"Whooperwill\" singing. Echo the opening line \"Beware the Fizzlethorn...\" but in a different context. Use repetition for echo.\n\nCheck rhyme schemes. Each stanza's rhyme should follow ABAB or ABCB. Let me verify:\n\nStanza 1: B (Beware), A (flicker-flack), B (glum), A (drum). Wait, ABAB. Yes.\n\nStanza 2: A (chuckle), B (twang), A (slick-slip), B (clamber). ABCB? Hmm, maybe structure as quatrains. Wait, \"Jabberwocky\" uses ABCB. Let me check:\n\nOriginal first stanza:\n'Twas brillig and the slithy toves\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe:\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.\n\nABCB. So, lines 1 and 3 rhyme (A), 2 and 4 (B). So, need to follow that. Let me adjust the stanzas accordingly.\n\nStanza 1: Lines 1 and 3 rhyme (B), 2 and 4 (A)? Wait, maybe I messed up. Let's re-examine. First line ends with \"Fizzlethorn's\" (B), second \"flicker-flack\" (A), third \"glum\" (B), fourth \"drum\" (A). So ABAB? Hmm, conflicting. Maybe better to stick strictly to ABCB.\n\nWait, user said ballad rhyme ABAB/ABCB. So either is acceptable. Let me check each stanza again.\n\nFirst stanza:\nBeware the Fizzlethorn's grim snicker (A)\nThat flicker-flacks at dusk's dull drum (B)\nWhen Whingeing Wings go glum and quicker (A)\nTo Layover Bay, where fliers succumb (B)\n\nHmm, this seems ABAB. Maybe that's okay. Alternatively, adjust to ABCB.\n\nBut the user allows either, so perhaps proceed. Then ensure each stanza has new coinages. Stanzas have Fizzlethorn, Mumblecrab, Frazzlepox, Whooperwill. Onomatopoeia: flicker-flack, gloop-splat, thwack, whim-wham. Alliteration: whingeing wings, glimmer-glint, mumble-mire, whimsy-wham.\n\nArc: First stanza warning, second preparation, third encounter/slay, fourth return/celebration. Ending with the echoed warning as a testament. Need to make sure the opening line is echoed at the end. \"Beware the Fizzlethorn...\" and the last line \"Beware the Fizzlethorn—its tale's been told!\" which mirrors the opening.\n\nAvoid verbatim lines, so paraphrase the opening warning in the end.

A desire path is a trail created by foot traffic, so I need to blend that idea with the fantastical elements.\n\nFor the warning stanza, introduce a creature and some alliteration. Carroll uses words like \"frumious\" and \"whiffling.\" Let me invent a creature, maybe \"mimsygrumps\" that lurk in the shadows. Onomatopoeia could be \"squelch\" and \"gurgle.\" The warning should caution about the path's risks.\n\nPreparation stanza: The traveler needs to gear up. Maybe \"moonmilk boots\" and \"starmetal gloves.\" The creature here could be \"glamourghasts\" that try to mislead. Alliteration like \"shimmer-shriek\" and onomatopoeia \"tink\" and \"clink.\"\n\nEncounter/slay: Introduce the main antagonist. Let's name it \"Flickerwrym\" with \"ember eyes.\" The battle involves a \"snicker-snack\" blade, referencing Jabberwocky's vorpal sword.

'Jabberwocky' by Lewis Carroll uses nonsense words, playful language, and a bouncy rhythm. The rhyme scheme is usually ABAB or ABCB, so I need to stick to that. The user specified a ballad rhyme, so maybe quatrains with that structure.\n\nFirst, the title needs to be catchy and reminiscent of 'Jabberwocky'. Maybe something like \"The Fogwraith's Fray\" to introduce a creature and action. The arc should be warning, preparation, encounter/slay, return/celebration, and echo the opening at the end.\n\nStarting with a warning. In 'Jabberwocky', it begins with \"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!\" So here, maybe warn about the Fogwraith. Need some coinages here. \"Fogwraith\" is a start, but also maybe \"mistmaws\" and \"glimmergut\" as made-up terms. Onomatopoeia like \"hiss-hush\" could work.\n\nNext stanza: preparation. The protagonist needs to gear up. Invent a weapon, like a \"snicker-snath\" (similar to vorpal blade). Use alliteration like \"whispering\" and \"wield\". Maybe \"glibberglow\" for some sort of light source. Onomatopoeia: \"tink-tink\" of a bell.\n\nThird stanza: encounter. Introduce the creature, \"Flish\" with \"flumplenooks\". Action here: slashing the Flish, using onomatopoeia like \"splat-squelch\". Show the battle, maybe the fog reacting with \"hiss-hush\" again.\n\nFourth stanza: return and celebration. Use \"Twas brillig\" as in the original, but modified to fit the fog theme. Echo the opening line. Include \"mome wrath\" and \"jade jaws\" as new terms. End with a celebratory note and a callback to the title.\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme for each stanza. ABAB or ABCB. Let's see:\n\nStanza 1: fog/son, maws/gut – ABCB\nStanza 2: blade/bell, glow/slew – ABCB\nStanza 3: fell/look, squelch/steal – ABCB\nStanza 4: jaws/lore, throng/song – ABCB. Okay, that works.\n\nCoinages in each stanza: fogwraith, mistmaws, glimmergut; snicker-snath, glibberglow; flish, flumplenooks; mome wrath, jade jaws.\n\nOnomatopoeia: hiss-hush, tink-tink, splat-squelch.\n\nAlliteration: \"Heed the hish of morn\" (maybe not perfect), \"whispering wield\", \"Twas brillig\", \"mome wrath\", \"flumplenooks\".\n\nArc is followed: warning, prep, fight, return. Ending echoes the opening with \"the Fogwraith's Fray\" and \"hiss-hush\".\n\nAvoid verbatim lines from Jabberwocky. Use \"Beware\" but in a different context. Canon words limited, mostly new inventions.\n\nI think this meets the requirements. Let me put it all together and check the flow.\n</think>\n\n**The Fogwraith’s Fray**  \n\nHeed the hish of morn, my son,  \nWhen fogwraiths snick and creep—  \nBeware the mistmaws’ glimmergut,  \nTheir jaws in hiss-hush steep.  \n\nTake the snicker-snath in hand,  \nWhispering, wield with care;  \nTink-tink the glibberglow bell,  \nSeek the gloom to share.  \n\n“Beware the Flish,” the fogs cry,  \nWith flumplenooks in tow,  \nIts blade-slash splits the vap’rish fell—  \nSplat-squelch, the dawn to know.  \n\nTwas brillig when he strode back,  \nMome wrath still in his lore,  \nJade jaws agape, fogwraith’s hymn  \nNow thrummed a victor’s score.  \n\nSo here’s to morn’s dissembled throng,  \nThe fray that dares the mist—  \nHiss-hush the Fogwraith’s Fray unsung,  \nAnd glory smites the drist.", "info": {"topic": "morning fog"}, "reward": 1.0, "label": "high", "criteria_yes": 18, "metrics": {"composite_score": 1.0, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "model_id": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "model_slug": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1"}

Original Jabberwocky starts with \"Twas brillig...\" So maybe \"Beware themanaflax...\" Manaflax could be a creature. Then establish the setting with onomatopoeia like \"clickyclack\" of keyboards. Alliteration like \"shimmering screens\" and \"glibs\" for glib presentations.\n\nSecond stanza: preparation. Introduce a weapon, like \"vocab Shiv.\" More coinages: \"Snicker-Snarks\" as a creature. Onomatopoeia with \"hissper\" and \"growl.\" Alliteration like \"sly persuasions.\"\n\nThird stanza: encounter. Bring in the named creature, \"Snicker-Snark.\" Use onomatopoeia like \"SCREEE-mmm\" and \"blorp.\" Battle scene with monitors flickering, data streams. Defeat with \"Voltox bloomed\" and \"plink\" of a mic.\n\nFourth stanza: return and celebration. \"Triumphant sprint\" back to the office. Alliteration like \"gloopernacks\" and \"glintzen mugs.\" Echo the opening warning at the end: \"And whether came...\" to loop back to the start.\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme: ABAB throughout.

Introduce \"Flishyblop\" and \"Vroomalope\", onomatopoeia like \"VROOOOM\".\n\nThird stanza:\nThe Flishyblop oozed with a gloam-squelch\nI lunged where the Vroomalope shrilled “VROOOOM!”\nIt writhed, all flazzlepox, roused to clutch\nMy blade bit its snicker — then still, then tomb.\n\n\"Gloam-squelch\" combines dusk and sound. \"Vroomalope\" and \"VROOOOM\" as onomatopoeia. \"Flazzlepox\" for texture.\n\nFourth stanza: return and celebration. Echo the opening line. Maybe \"Beware the Echoflump...\" again. Mention returning, onomatopoeia like \"ting-a-ling\".\n\nFourth stanza:\nWe trudged back through the gloopstains of dawn\nThe city’s loud-twang hummed ting-a-ling brazen\nNo glissando stalked where his glimmer went drawn\nBeware the Echoflump’s ululation!\n\n\"Gloopstains\" for morning residue. \"Loud-twang\", \"ting-a-ling\" onomatopoeia. \"Glissando\" musical term for sliding sound. End with the opening line.\n\nCheck rhymes. Each stanza is ABAB. Coinages in each stanza: Echoflump, Glintzelwraithe, Flishyblop, Vroomalope. Onomatopoeia and alliteration present. The arc follows warning, prep, battle, return. The opening line is echoed at the end.\n\nNow, ensure no canonical words are repeated verbatim. Use \"ululation\" instead of \"Jabberwock\" terms. Seems okay. All set.

Echo the opening at the end. Avoid verbatim lines; limit canonical words.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about a printer jam in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" Let me recall how that poem works. \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll uses nonsense words, playful language, and a specific rhyme scheme. The user mentioned ABAB or ABCB rhyme scheme, so I need to stick to that. Also, they want a lively alternating cadence, which means varying the stress and rhythm.\n\nFirst, the title should be catchy and reference both the printer and the fantastical style. Maybe something like \"The Frumious Jam\" since \"frumious\" is a Carroll coinage from \"fuming\" and \"furious.\"\n\nNext, the structure needs to follow the arc: warning, preparation, encounter/slay, return/celebration, and echo the opening at the end. Let me outline each stanza.\n\nWarning stanza: Introduce a creature that warns the protagonist. Carroll uses made-up creatures like the Jabberwock, so maybe the \"Inkthimble\" with \"gloomious\" as an adjective. Onomatopoeia here could be a sound the creature makes, like \"Slishy! Sloo!\" Alliteration with \"s\" sounds.\n\nPreparation: The protagonist gathers tools. Use alliterative names for the tools, like \"jam-tongs\" and \"pixel-spear.\" Onomatopoeia for the preparation action, maybe \"Clink, clank, sprawl!\" Coin a verb like \"galumphs\" but modify it to \"าจำนวนมาก\" – wait, no, needs to be English. Maybe \"galumphs\" is okay but the user wants new coinages. So \"flarping\" screens and \"glintzen\" blades.\n\nEncounter: Battle the jam. The jam could be a creature, \"The Jamjow!\" with \"gl stitched\" as a coinage. Onomatopoeia like \"Ztix! Ztoom!\" Alliteration in \"vicious vortex.\" Use words that mix tech and fantasy, like \"paperwyrm\" and \"toner-talons.\"\n\nSlay the jam: Action of defeating it. \"Plinksnap\" as the sound of breaking. \"Flish, floam, unfurl!\" for the unjamming. \"Beglian blades\" as invented tools. Alliteration with \"shrieking shafts.\"\n\nReturn/Celebration: Triumph and returning to normal. \"Burble\" and \"chortle\" as sounds. \"Inkthimble\" returns to give a thumbs-up. Onomatopoeia \"Huzzah! Hum, hush.\" Echo the opening line \"Beware the frumious jam!\" to close.\n\nCheck rhyme scheme: Each stanza ABAB or ABCB. Let me test the first stanza:\n\n\"Beware the frumious jam, my son!\nThe Inkthimble’s ‘gloomious’ call—\nSlishy! Sloo! The maw is spun,\nZorbles clogged in yonder hall.\"\n\nABAB rhyme: jam, call (not perfect, maybe \"son\" and \"call\" don't rhyme. Oops, need to fix. \"Son\" and \"call\" are not rhyming. Let's adjust. Maybe:\n\n\"Beware the frumious jam, my son!\nSlishy! Sloo! The maw is spun,\nThe Inkthimble’s ‘gloomious’ call—\nZorbles clogged in yonder hall.\"\n\nNow the rhyme is son/spun, call/hall – no, still not. Maybe ABCB for easier rhyming. Let me try:\n\n\"Beware the frumious jam, my son!\nThe Inkthimble’s ‘gloomious’ call\nSlishy! Sloo! The maw is spun,\nZorbles clogged in yonder hall.\"\n\nNow ABAB: son, call, spun, hall – not matching. Maybe \"son\" and \"call\" don't need to rhyme if it's ABCB. Wait, Carroll sometimes uses ABCB. Let me check:\n\nOriginal \"Jabberwocky\" first stanza:\n\n'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe:\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.\n\nThat's ABCB: toves, wabe, borogoves, outgrabe. So the second and fourth lines rhyme. Wait, wabe and outgrabe – not exactly. Hmm, maybe he uses near rhymes. So maybe I can have ABCB with the second and fourth lines slant rhyming.\n\nBut user says \"ballad rhyme (ABAB/ABCB)\", so perhaps alternate between ABAB and ABCB. Let me check the user's example again. They said to keep ballad rhyme (ABAB/ABCB). So either of those is acceptable. Let's go with ABCB for consistency.\n\nLet me adjust the first stanza:\n\n\"Beware the frumious jam, my son!\nSlishy! Sloo! The maw is spun—\nThe Inkthimble’s ‘gloomious’ call\nZorbles clogged in yonder hall.\"\n\nNow ABCB: son, spun, call, hall – no, call and hall rhyme (hall and call are near rhymes, maybe acceptable). Alternatively:\n\n\"Beware the frumious jam, my son!\nThe Inkthimble murmurs, ‘Gloom, gloom!’\nSlishy! Sloo! The maw is spun,\nZorbles choke the printer’s womb.\"\n\nNow son, gloom, spun, womb – not rhyming. Hmm. This is tricky. Let me try to force ABCB:\n\n\"Beware the frumious jam, my son!\nSlishy! Sloo! The gears now hum,\nThe Inkthimble’s ‘gloomious’ call\nZorbles breed in yonder room.\"\n\nNow son (A), hum (B), call (C), room (B). Not ABCB. Maybe ABAB:\n\n\"Beware the frumious jam, my son!\nThe Inkthimble’s ‘gloomious’ call—\nSlishy! Sloo! The maw is spun,\nZorbles clog the printer’s hall.\"\n\nNow ABAB: son, call, spun, hall. Still not perfect. Maybe \"hall\" and \"call\" can be slant rhymes. In Carroll, the rhymes are sometimes near. Okay, proceed.\n\nNext stanza: preparation.\n\n\"He seized the jam-tongs of might,\nClink, clank, sprawl! He layouts ground,\nFlarping through the glintzen blades,\nVowed to slay the foe unbound.\"\n\nA: might, ground, blades, unbound. Doesn't rhyme. Need ABCB. Let's fix:\n\n\"He snatched the pixel-spear of old,\nClink, clank, sprawl! He layouts ground,\nFlarping through the glintzen blades,\nVowed to vanquish the foe unbound.\"\n\nNow old, ground, blades, unbound. Not ABCB. Maybe:\n\n\"He grasped the jam-tongs keen of edge,\nClink, clank, sprawl! The paper’s heaving,\nFlarp through the glintzen, blades outspread,\nVowed to conquer, thread by thread.\"\n\nEdge, heaving, spread, thread – no. Struggling here. Let me focus on ABCB:\n\n\"He seized the jam-tongs, bold of grip,\nClink, clank, sprawl! He layouts ground,\nFlarping through the glintzen blades,\nVowed to slay the foe unbound.\"\n\nGrip, ground, blades, unbound – not ABCB. Maybe need different structure.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n\"With jam-tongs raised and pixel-spear,\nClink, clank, sprawl! The hall he’ll tread,\nHe blitzes snarls of glintzen hair,\nTo joust the jam that slinks ahead.\"\n\nSpear, tread, hair, ahead – ABCB. Tread and ahead rhyme. Okay.\n\nThird stanza: encounter.\n\n\"Long time the foe in cartridge gloom\nFlish, floam, frapp! The fiend’s design,\nHad snavished reels in v venom’s plume,\nTill—‘Tosh!’—he spied the Jamjow’s shine.\"\n\nGloom, design, plume, shine – ABCB. Gloom and design don't rhyme, design and plume? Not quite. Maybe:\n\n\"Long time the foe in cartridge gloom\nFlish, floam, frapp! The threads did sing,\nHad snavished reels in venom’s plume,\nTill—‘Tosh!’—he spied the Jamjow’s sting.\"\n\nGloom, sing, plume, sting – ABCB: sing and sting rhyme. Okay.\n\nFourth stanza: battle.\n\n\"The Jamjow glintzed its teeth of brass,\n‘Villain, thou art jammed, anon!’\nIts paperwyrm in vizor’d pass\nCrunched toner-talons, zraa! Zron!\"\n\nBrass, anon, pass, Zron – ABCB: anon and Zron don't rhyme. Maybe:\n\n\"The Jamjow glintzed its teeth of brass,\n‘Villain, thou art jammed, avant!’\nIts paperwyrm in vizor’d pass\nCrunched toner-talons, zraa! Zangl!\"\n\nBrass, avant, pass, Zangl – not rhyming. Maybe:\n\n\"The Jamjow glintzed its teeth of brass,\n‘Villain, thou art bound for trash!’\nIts paperwyrm in vizor’d pass\nCrunched toner-talons, zraa! Zlunk!\"\n\nBrass, trash, pass, Zlunk – ABCB: trash and Zlunk don't rhyme. Hmm. Let's try:\n\n\"The Jamjow glintzed its teeth of steel,\n‘Villain, thou art jammed, unseel!’\nIts paperwyrm in vizor’d peal\nCrunched toner-talons, zraa! Zrill!\"\n\nSteel, unseel, peal, Zrill – maybe steel and peal rhyme, unseel and Zrill? Not quite. This is challenging. Maybe prioritize onomatopoeia and coinages over perfect rhymes if needed, as per Carroll's style.\n\nFinal stanza: return and celebration.\n\n\"He plunged the blades in zingpocket deep,\nFlish, floam, unplink! Oh, frabjous cheer—\nThe Jamjow’s snout now still did keep,\nAndBurble! Chortle! All’s clear!\"\n\nDeep, cheer, keep, clear – ABCB: cheer and clear rhyme. Okay.\n\nEcho the opening line at the end: \"Beware the frumious jam!\"\n\nPutting it all together, check the flow and coinages. Ensure each stanza has a named creature (Inkthimble, Jamjow), onomatopoeia (Slishy, Sloo, Clink, clank, etc.), alliteration, and follows the arc. Revise any lines that don't meet the criteria. Make sure not to use verbatim lines from Jabberwocky but mimic the style. Avoid canonical words like \"Jabberwock,\" use new inventions. Once all elements are included, finalize the poem.\n</think>\n\n**The Frumious Jam**  \n\nBeware the frumious jam, my son!  \nSlishy! Sloo!

The user wants a poem in the style of \"Jabberwocky\" about a music room. First, I need to recall what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It's the nonsense words, playful language, and a ballad rhyme scheme. The rhyming pattern is ABAB or ABCB with a lively alternating cadence. So, each stanza should have four lines with that structure.\n\nThe user specified a title, so I need to come up with something that hints at a musical adventure. Maybe \"The Mimsy Melisma\" since \"mimsy\" is from the original poem and \"melisma\" relates to music. That works.\n\nNext, the arc: warning, preparation, encounter/slay, return/celebration, and echo the opening at the end. Let me break it down. Start with a warning about the music room's dangers. Then the protagonist prepares. They encounter a creature, defeat it, return, and celebrate. The end should mirror the beginning.\n\nInventing new coinages in each stanza is crucial. Words like \"glintzen\" for shiny, \"flumplenux\" as a creature name. Onomatopoeia and alliteration are needed. For example, \"Tink-a-ting, tonewrack\" mimics musical sounds. Alliteration like \"squelch the snickerfwomp\" adds that playful touch.\n\nThe creature needs a name. Let's go with \"Muckletusk\" for the beast in the music room. It should be something that obstructs music, maybe made of sheet music. The battle involves musical elements: harp strings, drumhead shield, flute as a weapon.\n\nEnsure the opening line is echoed at the end. Start with \"Beware the Mimsy Melisma\" and end with the same, perhaps with a slight twist to show resolution.\n\nCheck rhyme scheme. Each stanza ABAB. Let's draft the first stanza:\n\nBeware the Mimsy Melisma, my lackwit, and shun\nThe glintzen that glimmers in that tune-tossed lair,\nBeware the Muckletusk’s maul when the metronome’s undone –\n‘Tis a sound to flumplenax the froth from fond air.\n\n\"Shun\" and \"lair\" rhyme, \"undone\" and \"air\" rhyme? Wait, ABAB: first and third lines, second and fourth. Wait, first line ends \"shun\", second \"lair\", third \"undone\", fourth \"air\". So rhymes are shun/undone and lair/air. Hmm, maybe adjust to fit ABAB properly. Let me check syllable count and meter. Maybe \"Beware the Mimsy Melisma, my lackwit, and flee,\" to get the rhyme with \"spree\" later. Need to make sure the flow is right.\n\nInclude onomatopoeia: \"Tink-a-ting, tonewrack\" when entering the room. The battle scene needs action words and sound effects. After defeating the creature, celebrate with sounds like \"Cheerly chooms\" and \"jinglewhack\". End with the warning repeated but as a triumph, showing the journey's completion.\n\nAvoid verbatim lines from \"Jabberwocky\", so no \"Jabberwock\" or \"vorpal blade\".

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll uses made-up words, playful language, and a ballad rhyme scheme. So I need to invent new coinages, maybe some creatures, and include onomatopoeia and alliteration. The rhyme scheme should be ABAB or ABCB, keeping a lively cadence. \n\nThe arc needs to go from warning to preparation, then encounter/slay, and finally return/celebration. Also, the opening line should be echoed at the end. I have to avoid direct quotes from the original but capture the essence.\n\nStarting with the title. Maybe something alliterative related to conferences. \"Frabjulax in the Speaker's Glare\" – Frabjulax is a creature from the original, but here I can reimagine it as a conference monster.\n\nFirst stanza: Warning. Use some nonsense words. \"Beware the Frabjulax\" sets the warning. Onomatopoeia like \"clickyclack\" for keyboards. Maybe \"snicker-snack\" from the original, but modified. Introduce a creature here.\n\nSecond stanza: Preparation. The protagonist arms themselves. \"Grab your laser-pen\" – combining tech with the poem's style. \"Flarp the screen\" – \"flarp\" as a new verb. Include alliteration like \"mime the murmur-maze of meetings\".\n\nThird stanza: Encounter/Slay. Describe the battle with the Frabjulax. Onomatopoeia: \"Slishyblop!\" when attacking. Mention \"klikkety-clack\" for the sound of typing. Use teamwork to defeat it, introducing another creature like \"snickerwings\" maybe.\n\nFourth stanza: Return/Celebration. After victory, return to the group. \"Froth the coffee, proof the spiel\" – combining action with business terms. Echo the opening line \"Beware the Frabjulax\" at the end, modified slightly.\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme. Each stanza should follow ABAB. Let me verify each line's end words. First stanza: Glare, snare, air, flair – that's ABAB. Second: deep, keep, maze, phase – ABCB? Hmm, maybe need to adjust. \"Squelch the shush\" – \"squelch\" and \"shush\" might not rhyme. Maybe rephrase to \"squelch the whisper\" to rhyme with \"glow\" if needed.\n\nOnomatopoeia and alliteration: Each stanza should have them. \"Clickyclack\", \"slishyblop\", \"fizzypop\". Creatures: Frabjulax, snickerwings. \n\nAvoid canonical words. Don't use exact phrases from \"Jabberwocky\", just the style. \n\nEcho the opening at the end.

The user specified four stanzas with an arc: warning, preparation, encounter/slay, return/celebration, and echo the opening at the end.\n\nFirst, the title. \"Jabberwocky\" uses \"Jabberwock,\" so maybe something similar. \"The Crepus glorax\" or \"Glimmerwings\"? Wait, they mentioned \"creep\" as the main subject. Maybe \"The Creep\" as the title? But needs to be more whimsical. \"The Creep of Crankledale\" perhaps?\n\nEach stanza needs new coinages, a named creature, onomatopoeia, and alliteration. Let's break it down stanza by stanza.\n\nFirst stanza: Warning. Introduce the creep and maybe a creature that warns the protagonist. Use alliteration, like \"squelch of slithermaws\" or \"flumplenuxes flee.\" Onomatopoeia here, like \"shriek\" or \"squelch.\" The warning tells the protagonist to beware the creep.\n\nSecond stanza: Preparation. The protagonist gears up. Maybe a named weapon or armor. \"Glintblade\" or \"stargrit shield.\" Coinages like \"glimmerwings\" for something they take. Alliteration in actions: \"shuffle, shamble, creep.\"\n\nThird stanza: Encounter/slay. Introduce the creep with onomatopoeia as it attacks: \"squelch-THWACK\" or \"gurgle-screech.\" The fight involves the glintblade and maybe the creature's weakness, like fire or light. Slaying the creep, using alliteration in the action: \"hiss, hack, hiss, hack.\"\n\nFourth stanza: Return/celebration. Return home, maybe with a trophy. Echo the opening line to wrap up. Onomatopoeia in celebration: \"cheers and chiming,\" alliteration in \"moonmilk mead.\" End with the echoed warning, tying back to the start.\n\nCheck ballad rhyme scheme. Each stanza four lines, ABAB or ABCB. Let's go with ABAB for consistency.\n\nInvent new coinages each stanza. First stanza: slithermaws, crankledale. Second: glimmerwings, stardust. Third: glorp, flazzle. Fourth: moonmilk, LOVELY loops.\n\nOnomatopoeia: squelch, shriek, THWACK, gurgle, screech, WHOOF, chime.\n\nAlliteration: squelch of slithermaws, flumplenuxes flee, shuffle, shamble, creep, hiss, hack, glorp and glint, flazzle and flare, HISSED, died, dawn, down,aktually, cheery chiming.\n\nCreature names: creep, momeflax, maybe others? Wait, user said introduce a named creature each stanza? Let me check. \"Introduce a named creature\" in each stanza. Oh, that's a bit tricky. So each stanza has a new creature. Hmm.\n\nFirst stanza: slithermaws (the creature that warns). Second stanza: maybe momeflax (the armor or weapon?). Third stanza: the creep itself. Fourth stanza: maybe a creature in celebration, like momeflax again? Or perhaps the creatures from the first stanza return.\n\nWait, the user says \"introduce a named creature\" in each stanza. So each stanza needs a new creature. Maybe:\n\nStanza 1: Slithermaws (warn)\nStanza 2: Glimmerwings (help prepare)\nStanza 3: Creep (the main antagonist)\nStanza 4: Flumplenuxes (return, celebration)\n\nBut not sure. Alternatively, each stanza has a creature, even if minor. Let's adjust:\n\nStanza 1: Flumplenuxes flee (warn), slithermaws (the threat)\nStanza 2: Glimmerwings (equipment)\nStanza 3: Creep (antagonist)\nStanza 4: ??? Maybe the momeflax (but that's an action). Alternatively, when returning, the slithermaws cheer?\n\nHmm, maybe the user meant that in each stanza, a new named creature is introduced. So four stanzas, four creatures. Let me see:\n\nStanza 1: Slithermaws (the ones fleeing/shrieking)\nStanza 2: Glimmerwings (the thing they take)\nStanza 3: Glorp (the creep's attack)\nStanza 4: ??? Maybe the \"momeflax\" is a creature? Or \"flazzle\" is a verb. Perhaps in the final stanza, the creatures from the first return, but maybe that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, the fourth stanza could mention \"moonmilk serpents\" or something, but needs to fit the rhyme.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the momeflax is a creature. Let's adjust:\n\nStanza 1: Slithermaws (they shriek)\nStanza 2: Glimmerwings (they clothe)\nStanza 3: Creep (the main antagonist)\nStanza 4: Flumplenuxes (they cheer)\n\nYes, that works. Each stanza introduces a new creature.\n\nNow check alliteration and onomatopoeia per stanza. First stanza: \"squelch of slithermaws\" (alliteration), \"shriek\" (onomatopoeia). Second: \"glimmerwings\" (coinage), \"shuffle, shamble, creep\" (alliteration). Third: \"squelch-THWACK\" (onomatopoeia), \"gurgle-screech\" (onomatopoeia). Fourth: \"WHOOF\" (onomatopoeia), \"cheers and chiming\" (onomatopoeia).\n\nCoinages: Each stanza has new ones. Slithermaws, crankledale, glimmerwings, stardust, glorp, flazzle, moonmilk, LOVELY loops.\n\nBallad rhyme: ABAB. Let's verify each stanza.\n\nStanza 1:\nBeware the Creep of Crankledale,\nSquelch of slithermaws who shriek—\nWhen flumplenuxes flee, the gale\nScreams, “Beware the momeflax meek!”\n\nABAB: Crankledale (A), shriek (B), gale (A), meek (B). Yes.\n\nStanza 2:\nDon your glimmerwings, grab stardust,\nTo traverse thorns where shadow drinks.\nWith glintblade and salt, you’ll thrust\nThrough burbles that the dusk-out blurbs.\n\nABAB: stardust (A), drinks (B), thrust (A), blurbs (B).\n\nStanza 3:\nIt came with glorp and flazzle,\nHissed, “Snicker-Snack!” in gurgle-screech—\nWe fought with flumplenooks in dazzle,\nSquelch-THWACK! The blade did gurgle-cleave.\n\nABAB: flazzle (A), screech (B), dazzle (A), cleave (B).\n\nStanza 4:\n“O fringe of froth!” the momeflax\nShrieked, HISSED, then died. At dawn’s sweet peal,\nI sipped moonmilk mead, unwaxed,\nAnd LOVELY loops of frabjul-frill.\n\nWait, the rhyme here: momeflax (A), peal (B), unwaxed (A), frill (B). Hmm, \"unwaxed\" might not rhyme with \"momeflax.\" Maybe adjust. Let me check:\n\nOriginal last stanza:\n\n“O fringe of froth!” the momeflax <br>\nShrieked, HISSED, then died. At dawn’s sweet peal, <br>\nI sipped moonmilk mead, unwaxed, <br>\nAnd LOVELY loops of frabjul-frill.\n\nSo \"momeflax\" (A), \"peal\" (B), \"unwaxed\" (C?), \"frill\" (B). That breaks the ABCB. Need to fix. Let's adjust the third line to rhyme with \"peal\"—maybe \"I sipped moonmilk mead, so frill,\" but that's forced. Alternatively, change \"peal\" to \"meal\" but that loses the dawn's sound. Alternatively, make the third line rhyme with \"momeflax.\" Maybe \"I sipped moonmilk mead, relaxed\" (A). Then the rhyme would be ABCB. But \"relaxed\" doesn't fit the tone. Alternatively, adjust the second line's end word. Let's see:\n\nOriginal lines:\nShrieked, HISSED, then died. At dawn’s sweet peal,\nI sipped moonmilk mead, unwaxed,\n\nChange \"peal\" to \"wheel\" or \"feel\"? Not sure. Alternatively, make the third line rhyme with \"momeflax\"—perhaps \"I sipped moonmilk mead, aghast\" (but \"aghast\" and \"momeflax\" don't rhyme). This is tricky. Maybe better to rework the last stanza's rhyme scheme to ABCB. Let me try:\n\n“O fringe of froth!” the momeflax <br>\nShrieked, HISSED, then died. At dawn’s sweet song, <br>\nI sipped moonmilk mead, so frax, <br>\nAnd LOVELY loops of frabjul-frill.\n\nNow, \"momeflax\" (A), \"song\" (B), \"frax\" (A), \"frill\" (B). But \"frax\" is a stretch. Maybe \"I sipped moonmilk mead, so thrax,\" but not great. Alternatively, adjust the second line's end to \"At dawn's break,\" then third line \"I sipped moonmilk mead, awake,\" but still not perfect.\n\nAlternatively, accept that the last stanza might have ABCB. Let's check:\n\nStanza 4 rhyme: momeflax (A), peal (B), unwaxed (C), frill (B). Not quite ABCB. Maybe change \"unwaxed\" to \"so frax\" to rhyme with \"momeflax\" (A), and \"frill\" (B) with \"peal\" (B)? Not matching. Hmm. Perhaps the user allows some flexibility if it's close. Maybe prioritize the content over strict rhyme here, given the time constraints.\n\nAlso, echo the opening at the end. The first line is \"Beware the Creep of Crankledale,\" and the last line could be \"Beware the Creep of Crankledale!\" to echo.\n\nWait, in the initial draft, the last line is \"And LOVELY loops of frabjul-frill.\" Maybe adjust the final line to repeat the warning. Let's revise the last stanza:\n\nAt the end of the fight, after sipping mead, the narrator could say \"Beware...\" again. So:\n\n“O fringe of froth!” the momeflax <br>\nShrieked, HISSED, then died. At dawn’s sweet peal, <br>\nI sipped moonmilk mead, aglow, <br>\nAnd sang: “Beware the creep’s reveal!” \n\nNow the last line echoes the opening warning, with \"creep's reveal\" rhyming with \"peal\" (maybe slant rhyme). Not perfect, but keeps the echo.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n“O fringe of froth!” the momeflax <br>\nShrieked, HISSED, then died. At dawn’s sweet knell, <br>\nI sipped moonmilk mead, and quaffed <br>\nAnd cried, “Beware the Creep of Crankledale!” \n\nYes, this way the last line echoes the title, and \"knell\" and \"quaffed\" might not rhyme perfectly, but \"knell\" and \"quaffed\" are A and B, then \"Crankledale\" as A again. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the user allows some rhyme flexibility given the coinages and style mimicry.\n\nAlternatively, adjust the third line to rhyme with \"knell\":\n\n“O fringe of froth!” the momeflax <br>\nShrieked, HISSED, then died. At dawn’s sweet knell, <br>\nI sipped moonmilk mead, and swelled <br>\nAnd cried, “Beware the Creep of Crankledale!” \n\nNow \"knell\" (B), \"swelled\" (B), but stanza rhyme would be ABBC, which isn't ballad.
