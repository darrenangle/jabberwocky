Majority of stanzas (≥60%) have 2,4 rhyme and no AABB dominance.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza is verbatim the first stanza’s admonition part, repeating exact content words and full lines - strong ring composition with repeated content words and clear refrain.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>First stanza contains an admonition: “Beware the Furniturne, my son!” equivalent to the canonical warning.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation is present in stanza 2: “He took his spurning-knife in hand; Long time the Furniturne he sought— So rested he by the Tumtum tree, And stood a while in thought.”</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter/confrontation in stanza 3: “The Furniturne, with eyes of flame, Came whiffling through the tillered wood, And burbled as it came!”—indicates the arrival of adversary.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action in stanza 4: “One, two! One, two! And through and through The spurning-knife went snicker-snack! It left it dead, and with its head”—decisive slaying act resolving conflict.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration in stanza 5: “He went galumphing back. ‘And hast thou slain the Furniturne? Come to my arms, my beamish boy! O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!’ He chortled in his joy.”</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count of distinct invented coinages excluding canonical: spurning-knife, Furniturne, Reglet-bird, Grabbet-snatch, tillered wood. This is 5 distinct new coinages (Furniturne, Reglet-bird, Grabbet-snatch, spurning-knife, tillered) — fewer than 8 required.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinages appear in at least one word per stanza: yes, each stanza has ≥1 coinage including Furniturne, Reglet-bird, spurning-knife, Grabbet-snatch, tillered. So coinage is fairly well spread.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creature/entity distinct from canonical Jabberwock: Furniturne is named and central to action, also Reglet-bird and Grabbet-snatch named as creatures, but Furniturne is the focal adversary.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia present: “whiffling”, “burbled”, “snicker-snack!” from original poem repeated, counts as canonical onomatopoeia. No clear new onomatopoeic bursts beyond these; however, at least 2 canonical onomatopoeic bursts appear (“whiffling” and “snicker-snack”).</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: examples in “spurning-knife”, “Furniturne...flame” and “came;” some occurrences but not abundant. At least 2 stanzas show clear alliteration/consonance (e.g., “spurning-knife”, “Furniturne..flame” stanza, “snicker-snack”).</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration → ring echo (warning repeated as final stanza). Arc follows canonical order clearly.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim canonical lines appear in the last stanza, which repeats exactly the first stanza’s admonition. But the task specifies no line exactly matching canonical poem. However, the repeated stanza matches the model poem's own first stanza, not the canonical poem’s first stanza verbatim. The wording in the final stanza is identical to the first stanza of the model poem (not copying canonical). No line matches canonical poem text exactly aside from canonical coinages reused. So no exact lines from canonical poem other than reused coinages; \"Beware the Furniturne, my son!\" is new wording. So no verbatim canonical lines present.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens reused: “Beware”, “my son!”, “The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!”, “Beware the … and shun the frumious …” reused verbs and canonical phrases. Canonical tokens seem ≤8 distinct: jaws, bite, claws, catch, beware, frumious, whiffling, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish, callooh, callay, chortled, uffish, tumtum are canonical but note model keeps canonical coinages correct with little leftover. Since canonical tokens are below 8 distinct, within limit.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness per stanza similar to canonical: longer lines approximately 8-9 syllables, shorter lines approximately 5-7 syllables, consistent across all quatrains.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: repeated rhymes like “catch”/“shun” appear multiple times including ring echo stanza; overall rhyme pairs 2,4 vary except for ring echo repetition. No exact end word reused >2 times excluding ring stanza. Thus sufficient variety.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: words like “Furniturne”, “spurning-knife”, “Beware” repeated, but no single content word overused above threshold. No overuse >5 or 8% outside ring stanza.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages have at least 4 distinct roots (Furniturne, spurning, Grabbet, Reglet, tillered) well distributed; no single coined suffix dominates over 50%.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-style creature “Furniturne” and follows a Jabberwocky-themed narrative closely. No substitution of unrelated topic.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: motive of heroic caution, preparation, slaying, and celebration as in canonical poem is clear. Underlying theme of coming-of-age caution and triumph present, consistent and coherent subtext.</C24_think>\n</think>\n\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "model_id": "gemini-2.5-flash", "model_slug": "gemini-2.5-flash", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "google/gemini-2.5-flash"}

Stanza count 5 is within 5-8 required.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Check for alternating longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content-word difference in ≥60% (≥3 of 5) stanzas. Mixed syllable and word counts: 1st stanza seems alternated; 2nd stanza less clear; 3rd stanza less clear; 4th stanza less clear; 5th possibly less distinct.

The poem has \"Behold the werzle and its blotf!\" and \"I warned the tumps in grotty plight. Beware the pending movement's glut...\" which is a caution. This is an admonition early (2nd stanza).</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before encounter: 3rd stanza shows the protagonist preparing, grabbing \"my girdle-dorp, a vorpal tool of oily sheen\" and venturing forth, so preparation is present.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter is clear: stanza 4 describes the creature spinning, protagonist acting (\"I onthrayed thrice and smelt its grease! Then swiftly turned the zoggly cun…\")—this counts as confrontation.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: \"Decisive twist, and horrors ceased.\" indicates a decisive act resolving tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: stanza 5 indicates return home with \"rusty gleam,\" no more screw in wabe, tale told.

Yes, all with coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named non-canonical creature? \"werzle\" and \"blotf\" named and implicated as adversaries. Not canonical creatures from original poem. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia? No clear bursts like \"snicker-snack\" or \"burbled,\" just some \"whir and click\"—mild, not onomatopoeic bursts. Only \"whir and click\" present, which is borderline and not exactly bursts. Need ≥2 bursts; no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas? Examples: \"drivvy groaks,\" \"gyre and gimbal,\" \"swirling sworp\" show some alliteration. \"Decisive twist,\" \"tumps in grotty plight,\" \"blued screws,\" \"rusty gleam.\" Probably at least 2 stanzas with clear alliteration beyond incidental. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order canonical: warning admonition (stanza 2), preparation (3), encounter (4), decisive act (4), return/celebration (5). Sequence correct in canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No exact matches to canonical poem lines. All lines rewritten or coinages altered. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens ≤8? The poem uses \"’Twas brillig,\" \"wabe,\" \"mimsy,\" \"vorpal,\" \"beamish,\" \"snicker-snack\" absent, \"borogoves\" absent, \"mome\" absent. Only a few canonical words preserved: brillig, gyre/gimbal (variant), wabe, mimsy. Probably ≤8 distinct canonical tokens—yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness per quatrain: longer lines ~8-9 syllables, shorter ~5-7. Mixed per stanza. Samples:\n\nStanza 1 lines:  '’Twas brillig, and the drivvy groaks' (7 syll), 'Did gyre and gimbal in the wabe:' (7-8?), 'All mimsy were the flibberwumps,' (7-8), 'And blued screws ached with frothy wafe.' (7-8). Lines roughly even, less clear alternation.\n\nOthers less clear; syllable pattern inconsistent. Overall, syllable pattern is looser than Jabberwocky. Not tight enough for yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes are mostly distinct across stanzas (wabe/wafe, plight/blight, sheen/sheen repeated, grease/ceased, wabe/save). \"Sheen\" repeated exactly twice, within stanza 3 but only once repeated elsewhere. Variety sufficient. No exact end word reused >2 times (excluding ring echo). Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: no content word overused excessively. Most coinages appear no more than twice. Common words like \"the\" etc. are not content words. No word >5 times or 8%. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: many distinct roots (\"drivvy,\" \"groaks,\" \"flibberwumps,\" \"blotf,\" \"werzle,\" \"tumps,\" \"girdle-dorp,\" \"sworp,\" \"onthrayed,\" \"zoggly,\" etc.) No dominant suffix accounts for >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly addresses similar subject—creature hunt akin to Jabberwocky, with named creature(s), weapon/tool, confrontation, and returning triumphant. Matches theme. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: implied theme of struggle against threat, careful preparation, overcoming darkness (\"blued screws,\" \"horrors ceased\"), homecoming with peaceful aftermath. Some subtle undertone present, although more muted than canonical. Coherent implied layer detected.

Total stanza count 6, all quatrains, meets range 5-8.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>The meter shows some alternation of longer and shorter lines but it's inconsistent. The first stanza (gimble, orbits / snicker-snack / flowry / couch creak'd) has variable line lengths but not clearly alternating longer/shorter with ≥2 content words difference in majority of stanzas. Borderline but more no than yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Check rhyme (2,4) in ≥60% stanzas:  \n1) orbits / drops no rhyme  \n2) offspring / abides no rhyme  \n3) gripper / caught no rhyme (near rhyme no clear)  \n4) chiffers / in unclear, might slant rhyme with resin in fourth line?

Less than 60% rhyme. Also no avoidance of AABB dominance since no rhyme scheme emerges. So fails rhyme criterion.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Last stanza echoes the first stanza with very similar wording: \"'Twas gimble, and the reglet's orbits / Did snicker-snack through table tops— / All flowry were the furniture's splices... / And we are safe-in cautionary drops.\" This repeats key content words/phrases (gimble, reglet's orbits, snicker-snack, furniture's splices, cautionary drops) indicating ring composition present.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>There is an explicit early admonition: stanza 2 \"'Beware the Woomblewood, my offspring! / The snarled and renuncle that hides—...'\", a warning phrase matching \"Beware the...\" pattern.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Protagonist prepares: stanza 3 \"He took his frondle in his gripper: / Long time the plorksome foe he sought— / So flassed he in the chiffon shadows, / And fluffled, sneek, as he was caught.\" This shows taking weapon (frondle), searching (long time sought), standing/waiting or moving stealthily (flassed, fluffled).

And through the chiffers / He whizzed it brisk, the lime-green resin— / He left it shivered, scribbled, snapped in / The fettle-fixt, where mimicry begun.\" This describes clear confrontation/action with foe; execution of action implying meeting enemy.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive act present: stanza 4 implies \"He left it shivered, scribbled, snapped in The fettle-fixt,\" meaning foe damaged/defeated. Stanza 5 asks \"And has thou slorn the reglet's norkle?\", confirming outcome with return; decisive act is implied in stanza 4 and referenced in stanza 5.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: stanza 5 and 6 imply return: \"Come back, my seat! It cracks with fright— / The furniture, untamed, now murmurs / In mumbled glidges through the night.\" Stanza 6 repeats opening lines and ends with \"And we are safe-in cautionary drops.\" No overt jubilant celebration or joy chortle as in original, subtle impression of safety but not ecstatic acknowledgement. Does not clearly meet jubilation.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: reglet, orbits (common?), snicker-snack (canonical), flowry, splices (English), Couch creak'd (English), Woomblewood, snarled, renuncle, splint, shlark, miching, beam, frondle, gripper, plorksome, flassed, chiffon, fluffled, sneek, chiffers, lime-green resin, fettle-fixt, mimicry, slorn, norkle, glidges. Many neologisms (reglet, Woomblewood, renuncle, shlark, frondle, plorksome, flassed, fluffled, sneek, chiffers, fettle-fixt, slorn, norkle, glidges). Easily more than 8 distinct coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza has at least one coinage word: e.g. stanza 1 \"reglet\", stanza 2 \"Woomblewood\", stanza 3 \"frondle\", \"plorksome\", stanza 4 \"chiffers\", \"fettle-fixt\", stanza 5 \"slorn\", \"norkle\", stanza 6 \"reglet\", \"gimble\". Meets requirement.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creature: \"Woomblewood\" is named as adversary and \"reglet\" mentioned multiple times and central to action. Woomblewood is the named foe, non-canonical creature/entity (not Jabberwock). So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"snicker-snack\" (canonical), \"whizzed\" (somewhat onomatopoeic), no clear second burst like \"Pop!\" or \"Hiss!\". Only one clear onomatopoeic burst (snicker-snack). Not two. So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance is notable in stanza 2 (\"snarled and renuncle that hides\") and stanza 3 (\"flassed he in the chiffon shadows, And fluffled, sneek\"). Also stanza 5 has sibilance and consonance. So ≥2 stanzas feature deliberate alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repetition.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning (stanza 2), preparation (3), encounter and decisive act (4), return (5-6). Order is canonical, no beat out of place.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines verbatim from original poem detected. Similar phrases but novel wording and phrasing except canonical \"snicker-snack\"; that is an allowed canonical token.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens are few: snicker-snack, Beware, And, the, in, my, One, two!, Did, Did, It—these are mostly function words. Canonical lexicon words are \"snicker-snack\", \"Beware\", \"And\", \"One, two!\", a few function words. Less than or equal to 8 distinct canonical tokens, so yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts roughly approximate Jabberwocky’s pattern: longer lines ~8–9 syllables, shorter lines ~5–7 in most quatrains, though some variation; fits tight syllable range close enough for each quatrain stanza.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety poor: end rhymes (2,4) generally absent or failing, and several repeated ending words like orbits and drops twice. No clear rhymes or varied rhymes. So no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No content word overused excessively; coinages and content words well distributed. No evidence of >5 or >8% repetition.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages have multiple distinct roots: reglet, Woomblewood, frondle, plorksome, flassed, chiffers, fettle-fixt, slorn, norkle, glidges, etc. No suffix dominates >50%. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-style narrative with named foe \"Woomblewood\" and protagonist action against it, matching the original poem’s thematic arc and style; no topic substitution.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: subtle cautionary tone in the repeated \"cautionary drops,\" \"furniture creaking,\" \"mumbled glidges through the night\" suggests underlying motif of vigilance or domestic menace.

Total stanza count=4, which is less than the required 5-8 stanzas. So no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter echo requires ≥60% stanzas with alternating longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content-word difference. The meter is inconsistent; no strong alternating syllable pattern or clear content word length differences in most stanzas. The last stanza is shorter and more irregular. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme check on (2,4): First stanza (lines 2&4) rhyme 'fey'/'seaguy'? No direct rhyme, \"fey\" and \"seaguy\" slant rhyme weakly. Second stanza: 'sun'/'marquint' no rhyme. Third stanza 'snicker-snack'/'track' good rhyme. Fourth stanza 'come'/'prise' no rhyme, so 1 of 4 stanzas (25%) has the expected rhyme pattern at lines 2 and 4. Does not meet ≥60%, so no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition requires final stanza echoing opening with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases or refrain. Final stanza repeats \"'Twas brillig\" phrase partially (modified: '’Twas brillig, and the shifty bards') which references first stanza wording ('’Twas satword' vs. ’Twas brillig). Only 1 repeated canonical content word \"’Twas brillig\" from original, but not from own poem. No clear echo within the model poem's own opening lines. No clear ring echo present.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning admonition: First stanza ends with \"Beware the Reglet, my seaguy!\" and second stanza begins with \"Beware the Furnitil, and shun\" which constitutes clear admonitions. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation armament: No clear protagonist preparation or tool pickup or waiting described; no lines indicating a preparation scene. No.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter confrontation: No explicit encounter scene where protagonist and creature meet; third stanza \"One two! One two! And through and through / The vorpaled blade went snicker-snack!\" implies an action, but no explicit description of meeting or confrontation. Minimal but arguably present; borderline but safer to say yes since battle described.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying decisive action: \"The vorpaled blade went snicker-snack!\" implies decisive killing/blade action. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return celebration: No stanza or lines describe return or celebration or jubilation after the act. No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Count distinct invented words not canonical or standard English: satword, shifty, gyve, fomblight, fey, bimsy, hambles, twards, Reglet, seaguy, Furnitil, hanfrails, prinkled, vextface, marquint, wonkled, chatboards, bangel, slackered, snicksnifed, prise. Many are coinages; well over 8 distinct coinages. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza has at least one coinage:  \n1st stanza: satword, shifty, gyve, fomblight, bimsy, hambles, twards, Reglet, seaguy  \n2nd stanza: Furnitil, hanfrails, prinkled, vextface, marquint  \n3rd stanza: wonkled, chatboards, bangel, slackered  \n4th stanza: snicksnifed, prise - also \"brillig\" (canonical), shifty (coinage)  \nYes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: Named creature \"Reglet\" is central to action (\"Beware the Reglet\", and question \"And hast thou slain the Reglet?\"). Not canonical. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"snicker-snack\" occurs once (canonical), \"One two! One two!\" attempts rhythmic bursts but not onomatopoeia. No other onomatopoeic bursts like Pop!, Hiss! etc. Only one canonical onomatopoeia. Not ≥2. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas: 1st stanza has some alliteration \"shifty bards\", \"fomblight fey\", \"bimsy\" \"hambles\" \"twards\". 2nd stanza: \"Furnitil\", \"hanfrails' wary, prinkled\", somewhat consonance. 3rd stanza and 4th less clear. At least two stanzas show clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order (warning → prep → encounter → action → return): Warning is present early; preparation is absent; encounter/action conflated; return/celebration absent. Order broken or incomplete. No.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: Final stanza uses \"'Twas brillig, and the shifty bards\\nDid gyve and hew like fomblight fey.\", so \"'Twas brillig...\" exact phrase is repeated from canonical poem's opening line, though slightly altered. Exact canonical line is \"'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\", but here \"and the shifty bards\" is substituted, so no exact word-for-word canonical line used. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget ≤8 distinct tokens: The poem uses \"brillig\", \"gyve\"(not canonical), \"snicker-snack\"(canonical), \"vorpaled\" (coinage from 'vorpal'), \"Reglet\"(coinage), \"shifty\" coinage, \"fey\"(not canonical, archaic English), so counting only canonical tokens: brillig, gyre not used, snicker-snack, vorpal (used as vorpaled), Possibly borderline but seems ≤8 canonical tokens used. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines ~8-9 syllables, shorter lines ~5-7 in each stanza. Checking stanza 1:  \n'Twas satword, and the shifty bards (7 syll)  \nDid gyve and hew like fomblight fey. (8 syll)  \nAll bimsy were the hambles, and the twards (9 syll)  \nBeware the Reglet, my seaguy! (7 syll)  \nLines somewhat irregular; alternating longer/shorter unclear; pattern not tight or consistent across all stanzas, so no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety across stanzas 2,4 ends: \"fey\"/\"seaguy\" weak rhyme, \"sun\"/\"marquint\" no rhyme, \"snicker-snack\"/\"track\" good, \"come\"/\"prise\" no rhyme, so limited rhyme variety and not meeting criteria. No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No obviously overused content word repeated >5 times or >8% of content words. \"Reglet\" repeated only a few times (2-3). No overuse. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Over 20 coinages visible with many distinct roots, no dominant suffix over 50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem addresses a Jabberwocky-like scenario with a named creature \"Reglet\" and a battle theme similar to original poem. Thema matches. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: No clear coherent implied motif or subtext beyond surface action; no clear deeper theme or undertone emerges consistently. No.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>", "model_id": "hermes-4-70b", "model_slug": "hermes-4-70b", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "nousresearch/hermes-4-70b"}

Alternation is unclear; line lengths and content word counts show less definite alternating long-short pattern.

Some coined words are sound evocative (e.g., “glimmer-zap”) but not clearly onomatopoeic bursts. Only one possible “glimmer-zap” sound effect. Not ≥2 clear onomatopoeic bursts.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Stanzas show some repeated consonant sounds (e.g., “flobber-tonsils all aflap”, “fooplèd, sputtering new-groan”), but do at least 2 stanzas have clear non-incidental alliteration/consonance beyond incidental?

No explicit canonical lexicon from the list (brillig, toves, borogoves...). So canonical tokens ≤8 is met favoring new coinages.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable pattern: longer lines about 8–9 syllables, shorter about 5–7 syllables, examining stanza 1: lines count (approx.) line 1 = 6 syll, line 2=6, line 3=7, line 4=6; no clear long/short alternating pattern at canonical levels. Mostly lines around 6-7 syllables, doesn’t strongly replicate Jabberwocky meter of ~8/6.

Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No single content word excessively repeated beyond limits. Coinages mostly unique. So no overuse of single words.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: over 8 coinages with multiple distinct roots, suffix variation visible (e.g., -let, -lens, -zap, -plocked), so ≥4 distinct roots with no single suffix dominating.

No topic shift or substitution. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Although poem is playful nonsense, the implied subtext about “bewarning” unusual changes and perception alterations hints at motif about caution versus reality changes and knowledge.

Lines vary but mostly similar length; the pattern of alternate longer/shorter lines with distinct difference is not strong or clear in ≥60% stanzas; borderline and uncertain, so no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme pattern for (2,4) in ≥60% stanzas: most stanzas have some rhyme or slant rhyme in lines 2 and 4, but the rhymes seem restricted to a few endings and AABB patterns possible. Also, no strong avoidance of AABB dominance since mostly couplet style rhymes rather than ballad ABCB-like rhymes.

Beware its chime-call, and oh, shun ...\", which is an admonition to the protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before the encounter: Protagonist takes no blade nor shield, but fetches a \"glint-glass\" to reveal wonders and see clearly.

Instead, protagonist observes and reveals truth that no dread was destroyed. No decisive violent or triumphant slaying.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: the penultimate stanza has a call of triumphant boy, and the protagonist tells a truth, but no real jubilant acknowledgement or celebratory homecoming is present. Rather a quiet reflection. So no celebration.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Counting distinct invented coinages (not canonical or standard English): grumm, umbril, chirl, maw, Glimmerwing, chime-call, thripple-thorn, whickered, scrimmed; roughly 9 distinct invented words (Glimmerwing is creature name).

So most stanzas have coinage; borderline but likely yes as each stanza has ≥1 coined term or proper noun.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>A non-canonical creature is named and central: \"Glimmerwing\" is the creature and central to the poem's action (admonition and encounter).</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia presence: no clear bursts like \"snicker-snack\", \"Pop!\", \"Hiss!\", or equivalent. \"Whickered\" and \"rustling\" imply sound but are not clear onomatopoeia bursts. Less than two clear bursts. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration or consonance beyond incidental: some alliterative elements like \"barren/begin\", \"chilling/chirl\" appear but no strong clear alliteration in ≥2 stanzas, seems mild or incidental. No.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: admonition → preparation → encounter → decisive action → return/celebration. This poem has admonition, preparation, encounter in order, but no decisive action and no celebration, so arc incomplete or broken. Borderline no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines detected; all lines original wording, no duplication of canonical poem's exact lines.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens use ≤8 tokens from canonical lexicon is favored. Poem uses none of the canonical words (brillig, slithy, toves, etc.) It substitutes all new vocabulary. So canonical budget is definitely ≤8 (zero). Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness per quatrain: longer lines ~8–9 syllables, shorter lines ~5–7. Checking stanza 1 line lengths:\n\n- ’Twas grumm, and umbril shadows fell (7 syllables)\n- Across the barren stubble-scraw; (7 syllables)\n- Did chirl the wind with chilling spell, (7 syllables)\n- And mock the grip of winter’s maw. (7 syllables)\n\nAll lines roughly 7 syllables, no clear alternating longer/shorter lines with the target pattern seen in Jabberwocky. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: End rhyme pairs (2,4) mostly rhyme on limited sets (\"flows\"/\"sows\", \"fray\"/\"day\"), and some repeated endings reappear >2 times across stanzas. So rhyme variety poor. No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No content word appears excessively repeated >5 times or >8% of total content words. Lexical repetition is low; yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages include grumm, umbril, chirl, maw, Glimmerwing, chime-call, thripple-thorn, whickered, scrimmed — at least 5-6 distinct roots without a single suffix dominating. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses the same topic of a mysterious creature (analogous to Jabberwock) with a warning, encounter, and reflection. So topic held correctly.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is a clear implied layer or motif about perception, fear, and truth—not destroying a villain but revealing reality behind a fright; reflective undertones beyond surface action are present.

So yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter pattern requires ≥60% stanzas have alternating longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content words difference. The meter is irregular, many lines with many invented words obscure counting. Some stanzas have roughly alternating line lengths, but many lines similar or inconsistent. Hard to confirm clear alternating meter in ≥60% stanzas. Tentatively no (too irregular).</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Check rhyme of lines 2 and 4 in ≥60% stanzas.

Stanza 4 describes “’Twas not a cog … It snapped the sill and tore the skin!”, stanza 5 describes “whap!”, “crack!” and a rattler whirling and crumpling the foe.

The last stanzas seem more abstract and melancholy. The last full stanza mentions “furniture sighed: All… is… ink.” which feels more like a resigned or ominous ending rather than jubilant return. No clear jubilant return or celebration. No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented coinages (excluding canonical listed words and standard English).

Quickly scanning, every stanza has multiple coined words (e.g., stanza 1: reglet, ravelry, flicker-springs, thrumms, winkers; stanza 2: frabjous, crust-sprocket, shiver-rails; stanza 3: clatter-glooms, fleam, wobble-weights, tremble-sweam, shaggy-jib; stanza 4: reglet-tongued, rattle-luff, grumble-eyes, twitch-grin; stanza 5: glimber, rattler, crank; stanza 6: furl, flumm; stanza 7: furniture, flicker-springs, crumb-sprocket, rattle-luff). Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Is a non-canonical creature/entity named and central? “Reglet” is clearly a creature/adversary, not canonical. The rattler and glimber seem like parts or allied entities but “reglet” is main adversary. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Are there ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts? The poem uses “whap!”, “crack!”, “snap!”, “thrum”, “shush”, “thaw”, “snapped”, “tore”. Of these “whap!” and “crack!” are clear onomatopoeic bursts, “snap” also frequent. Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Are there ≥2 stanzas with clear alliteration/consonance? Stanza 1: “flicker-springs and lurching boughs”, “thrumms beneath the winkers’ vows” moderate; stanza 2: “frabjous dust-veil, frothless, grim” strong repeated ‘f’ sounds; stanza 3: “clatter-glooms with lilt and fleam”, “wobble-weights by tremble-sweam” have repeated W, L, and S sounds; stanza 4: “rattle-luff”, “grumble-eyes”, “twitch-grin” grouped fricatives and consonants; definitely multiple stanzas with clear alliteration. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza 1) present; preparation (no clear preparation or armament) missing; encounter (stanza 4-5) present; decisive act (stanza 5) yes; return/celebration (no) no. Partial arc order present but not full canonical order. So no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines exactly verbatim from canonical poem. The poem uses some canonical words (e.g., frabjous), but no line exactly matches canonical lines. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens ≤8? The poem uses some canonical words e.g., frabjous, but largely new coinage. Canonical tokens are minimal and do not dominate. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines ~8–9 syllables, shorter ~5–7, alternating. The lines vary: “Beware the reglet in the ravelry” (8 syll), “Where furniture dreams in moonlit mire” (8), then “It thrumms beneath the winkers’ vows” (7), and other lines often longer or irregular length. No consistent alternating longer/shorter pattern for ≥60% stanzas. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: No consistent rhyme scheme discernible, so (2,4) rhymes highly varied or mostly absent. The rhymes are not reused in exact form >2 times due to rarity overall. Yes (since little repetition in rhyme words).</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No single content word overused extremely often. “Reglet” appears several times but not over 5 times or 8% of all content words; same for other terms. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages appear from many distinct roots - e.g. reglet, rattle-luff, flicker-springs, crust-sprocket, tremble-sweam, wobble-weights, glimber, rattler, grumble-eyes, twitch-grin, clatter-glooms, shiver-rails, shush, fleam, fur, flumm. No single suffix accounts for >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a fantastical encounter with a creature “reglet,” similar to Jabberwocky, not diverging into unrelated subject. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied layer: The poem’s “reglet” and mysterious furniture realm, the clash and aftermath, plus repeated words like “furniture sighed: All is ink” suggest a motif of decay, conflict, and quiet loss. An undertone of a struggle in an eerie environment seems present, so yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "model_id": "qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507", "model_slug": "qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507"}

Counting distinct coined or non-canonical words: tumblenight, quurl, chittering (borderline English?), snarl-tuned, clack-clamor, snarl-shivered, flash-crack, whir-tide — at least 8 distinct notable coinages (some compound), so yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage: e.g., opening stanza has \"blued\", \"whirl,\" \"tumblenight\" (“tumblenight” especially), second stanza \"quurl\", \"chittering\", \"snarl-tuned\", third stanza \"tines\", \"clack-clamor\", \"snarl-shivered\", fourth stanza \"quurl-blade\", \"snick\", \"flash-crack\", fifth stanza \"whirr-light\", \"calm-clank\", sixth stanza \"whir-tide\".

No explicit canonical coinages like \"brillig\" etc. appear. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count per line approximates original pattern (~8–9 longer lines, ~5–7 shorter lines in alternating pattern). Examples: stanza 1 lines vary from 7 to 9 syllables; alternating line lengths somewhat consistent; repeated pattern mostly present. So syllable tightness met.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety is limited: many stanzas use repeated rhyme words (\"day/gray\", \"deep/deep\", \"bright/bright\", \"still/still\", \"slow/still\", \"swift/swift\"); end words often repeated exactly or very close, so rhyme variety poor (no variation in end rhyme words excluding ring echo). So no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No content word is overused excessively: \"screw\" appears a few times but not >5 or >8%; lexicon is varied with coinages mostly, so lexical repetition guard held.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show diverse roots: \"tumblenight\", \"quurl\", \"chittering\", \"snarl-\", \"clack-\", \"flash-\", \"whir-\" etc., so at least 4 distinct coinage roots, no single suffix dominates more than 50%—yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence is consistent to a creature-themed poem with a confrontation and victory, echoing Jabberwocky’s theme without deviation; no unrelated topic detected.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>The poem contains a coherent implied layer of struggle against a mechanized foe (the \"blued screw\"), preparation, battle, and triumph, which can be interpreted as a motif of overcoming adversity or defeating an ominous force smoothly integrated across the poem—subtext present.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "model_id": "gpt-oss-120b", "model_slug": "gpt-oss-120b", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "openai/gpt-oss-120b"}
