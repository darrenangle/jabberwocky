Splook! Spling!\" he splatched\n  In his spiffy, gleeful joy.\n\n'Twas snillig, and the whirrious japes\n  Did clunk and glimmer in the snark:\nAll mimsy were the focal gapes,\n  And the mome sprockets outgrabe.", "info": {"topic": "film camera"}, "reward": 1.0, "label": "high", "criteria_yes": 18, "metrics": {"composite_score": 1.0, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}}
