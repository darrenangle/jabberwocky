Alternation is unclear; line lengths and content word counts show less definite alternating long-short pattern. Probably no clear ≥60% stanzas matching this meter alternation.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Checking rhyme of lines 2 and 4 in each stanza: Most stanzas rhyme or slant rhyme (grib/bib; jounce/pounce; lenses/inton(e); squall/hall; gleam/seem; light/flip). No obvious AABB dominance, stanzas mostly ABCB rhyme. So ≥60% stanzas have (2,4) rhyme with varied rhyme scheme.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes opening stanza conceptually (bewarn warning) but does not repeat ≥2 content words/phrases or have clear refrain identical to opening stanza. No explicit ring composition with repeated full lines or strong repeated phrase.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present: stanza 1 begins “Bewarn the day...” which is an admonition akin to “Beware...”to protagonist. So yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: stanza 2 describes protagonist taking his “splarch and blimble-lens”, checking evidence, and intoning spells—this counts as preparation before confrontation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation clear: stanza 3 shows appearance of monster “Grabbit”, stanza 4 describes hostile action (“issued one vast glimmer-zap”), so clear meeting moment.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive act: stanza 5 depicts protagonist acting on monster with splarch, resulting in monster’s end (“zinched to naught”), so decisive action resolving central tension is present.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: stanza 6 depicts return “Then back he came”, foe dispatched, and warning to beware twisting meanings; no explicit jubilant celebration or joy, but a kind of sober conclusion. Lacks jubilant or homecoming acknowledgment tone, more like reflective warning. So probably no.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Counting distinct coinages: gribble, grabbit, bewarn, reglets, blimble-lens, sprogged, fooplèd, sputtering new-groan, vrought, squim, squall, burfled, flobber-tonsils, glimmer-zap, plocked, flurped, zinched, glim-gloomed, clevern - well over 8 distinct coinages present.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage or invented compound word: yes all 6 stanzas have ≥1 coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature named and central: “Grabbit” is named (non-canonical, not Jabberwock) and is the adversary encountered and defeated, so yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia presence: no obvious classic onomatopoeia bursts or exclamations like “snicker-snack”, “Pop!”, “Hiss!”, or similar emphatic sound effects. Some coined words are sound evocative (e.g., “glimmer-zap”) but not clearly onomatopoeic bursts. Only one possible “glimmer-zap” sound effect. Not ≥2 clear onomatopoeic bursts.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Stanzas show some repeated consonant sounds (e.g., “flobber-tonsils all aflap”, “fooplèd, sputtering new-groan”), but do at least 2 stanzas have clear non-incidental alliteration/consonance beyond incidental? There is decent consonance in stanzas 3 and 4 and stanza 2. So yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: admonition (stanza 1) → preparation (stanza 2) → encounter (3-4) → decisive act (5) → return (6). This matches canonical narrative arc order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: no exact line duplicates from reference poem.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical word usage: Canonical lexicon largely avoided except \"bewarn\" a variant of “beware” but that is variant coinage; “then” and “his” normal English not canonical lexicon. No explicit canonical lexicon from the list (brillig, toves, borogoves...). So canonical tokens ≤8 is met favoring new coinages.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable pattern: longer lines about 8–9 syllables, shorter about 5–7 syllables, examining stanza 1: lines count (approx.) line 1 = 6 syll, line 2=6, line 3=7, line 4=6; no clear long/short alternating pattern at canonical levels. Mostly lines around 6-7 syllables, doesn’t strongly replicate Jabberwocky meter of ~8/6. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes mostly unique per stanza, different rhyme endings for all 6 stanzas, no repeated rhyme word >2 times. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No single content word excessively repeated beyond limits. Coinages mostly unique. So no overuse of single words.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: over 8 coinages with multiple distinct roots, suffix variation visible (e.g., -let, -lens, -zap, -plocked), so ≥4 distinct roots with no single suffix dominating. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem addresses an invented creature “Grabbit” and a fanciful confrontation, in the style of Jabberwocky’s nonsense quest; fits topic of matching style and structure to “Jabberwocky”. No topic shift or substitution. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Although poem is playful nonsense, the implied subtext about “bewarning” unusual changes and perception alterations hints at motif about caution versus reality changes and knowledge. Coherent undertone detectable.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}
