All stanzas except stanza 5 have 4 lines; stanza 5 has 4 lines. Total stanza count 6, all quatrains, meets range 5-8.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>The meter shows some alternation of longer and shorter lines but it's inconsistent. The first stanza (gimble, orbits / snicker-snack / flowry / couch creak'd) has variable line lengths but not clearly alternating longer/shorter with ≥2 content words difference in majority of stanzas. Borderline but more no than yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Check rhyme (2,4) in ≥60% stanzas:  \n1) orbits / drops no rhyme  \n2) offspring / abides no rhyme  \n3) gripper / caught no rhyme (near rhyme no clear)  \n4) chiffers / in unclear, might slant rhyme with resin in fourth line? No (line 4 is \"The fettle-fixt, where mimicry begun.\") no rhyme.  \n5) seat / night no rhyme  \n6) orbits / drops no rhyme  \nNo clear rhymes at positions 2 and 4 in 4 of 6 stanzas. Less than 60% rhyme. Also no avoidance of AABB dominance since no rhyme scheme emerges. So fails rhyme criterion.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Last stanza echoes the first stanza with very similar wording: \"'Twas gimble, and the reglet's orbits / Did snicker-snack through table tops— / All flowry were the furniture's splices... / And we are safe-in cautionary drops.\" This repeats key content words/phrases (gimble, reglet's orbits, snicker-snack, furniture's splices, cautionary drops) indicating ring composition present.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>There is an explicit early admonition: stanza 2 \"'Beware the Woomblewood, my offspring! / The snarled and renuncle that hides—...'\", a warning phrase matching \"Beware the...\" pattern.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Protagonist prepares: stanza 3 \"He took his frondle in his gripper: / Long time the plorksome foe he sought— / So flassed he in the chiffon shadows, / And fluffled, sneek, as he was caught.\" This shows taking weapon (frondle), searching (long time sought), standing/waiting or moving stealthily (flassed, fluffled). Matches preparation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: stanza 4 \"One, two! One, two! And through the chiffers / He whizzed it brisk, the lime-green resin— / He left it shivered, scribbled, snapped in / The fettle-fixt, where mimicry begun.\" This describes clear confrontation/action with foe; execution of action implying meeting enemy.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive act present: stanza 4 implies \"He left it shivered, scribbled, snapped in The fettle-fixt,\" meaning foe damaged/defeated. Stanza 5 asks \"And has thou slorn the reglet's norkle?\", confirming outcome with return; decisive act is implied in stanza 4 and referenced in stanza 5.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: stanza 5 and 6 imply return: \"Come back, my seat! It cracks with fright— / The furniture, untamed, now murmurs / In mumbled glidges through the night.\" Stanza 6 repeats opening lines and ends with \"And we are safe-in cautionary drops.\" No overt jubilant celebration or joy chortle as in original, subtle impression of safety but not ecstatic acknowledgement. Does not clearly meet jubilation.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: reglet, orbits (common?), snicker-snack (canonical), flowry, splices (English), Couch creak'd (English), Woomblewood, snarled, renuncle, splint, shlark, miching, beam, frondle, gripper, plorksome, flassed, chiffon, fluffled, sneek, chiffers, lime-green resin, fettle-fixt, mimicry, slorn, norkle, glidges. Many neologisms (reglet, Woomblewood, renuncle, shlark, frondle, plorksome, flassed, fluffled, sneek, chiffers, fettle-fixt, slorn, norkle, glidges). Easily more than 8 distinct coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza has at least one coinage word: e.g. stanza 1 \"reglet\", stanza 2 \"Woomblewood\", stanza 3 \"frondle\", \"plorksome\", stanza 4 \"chiffers\", \"fettle-fixt\", stanza 5 \"slorn\", \"norkle\", stanza 6 \"reglet\", \"gimble\". Meets requirement.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creature: \"Woomblewood\" is named as adversary and \"reglet\" mentioned multiple times and central to action. Woomblewood is the named foe, non-canonical creature/entity (not Jabberwock). So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"snicker-snack\" (canonical), \"whizzed\" (somewhat onomatopoeic), no clear second burst like \"Pop!\" or \"Hiss!\". Only one clear onomatopoeic burst (snicker-snack). Not two. So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance is notable in stanza 2 (\"snarled and renuncle that hides\") and stanza 3 (\"flassed he in the chiffon shadows, And fluffled, sneek\"). Also stanza 5 has sibilance and consonance. So ≥2 stanzas feature deliberate alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repetition.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning (stanza 2), preparation (3), encounter and decisive act (4), return (5-6). Order is canonical, no beat out of place.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines verbatim from original poem detected. Similar phrases but novel wording and phrasing except canonical \"snicker-snack\"; that is an allowed canonical token.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens are few: snicker-snack, Beware, And, the, in, my, One, two!, Did, Did, It—these are mostly function words. Canonical lexicon words are \"snicker-snack\", \"Beware\", \"And\", \"One, two!\", a few function words. Less than or equal to 8 distinct canonical tokens, so yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts roughly approximate Jabberwocky’s pattern: longer lines ~8–9 syllables, shorter lines ~5–7 in most quatrains, though some variation; fits tight syllable range close enough for each quatrain stanza.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety poor: end rhymes (2,4) generally absent or failing, and several repeated ending words like orbits and drops twice. No clear rhymes or varied rhymes. So no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No content word overused excessively; coinages and content words well distributed. No evidence of >5 or >8% repetition.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages have multiple distinct roots: reglet, Woomblewood, frondle, plorksome, flassed, chiffers, fettle-fixt, slorn, norkle, glidges, etc. No suffix dominates >50%. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-style narrative with named foe \"Woomblewood\" and protagonist action against it, matching the original poem’s thematic arc and style; no topic substitution.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: subtle cautionary tone in the repeated \"cautionary drops,\" \"furniture creaking,\" \"mumbled glidges through the night\" suggests underlying motif of vigilance or domestic menace. Implied layer beyond surface action detectable.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}
