All stanzas are quatrains.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Examining line lengths for alternating meter: stanzas mostly mimic Jabberwocky’s pattern with longer and shorter alternating lines; more than 60% of stanzas show this longer/shorter alternation with ≥2 content words difference.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme in most stanzas is on lines 2 and 4. Rhyme pairs include catch/shun (slant), sought/thought, flame/came, snicker-snack/back, boy/joy, catch/shun (repeated). The final stanza repeats the first, but AABB is avoided except at ring echo.

So coinage is fairly well spread.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creature/entity distinct from canonical Jabberwock: Furniturne is named and central to action, also Reglet-bird and Grabbet-snatch named as creatures, but Furniturne is the focal adversary.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia present: “whiffling”, “burbled”, “snicker-snack!” from original poem repeated, counts as canonical onomatopoeia. No clear new onomatopoeic bursts beyond these; however, at least 2 canonical onomatopoeic bursts appear (“whiffling” and “snicker-snack”).</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: examples in “spurning-knife”, “Furniturne...flame” and “came;” some occurrences but not abundant. At least 2 stanzas show clear alliteration/consonance (e.g., “spurning-knife”, “Furniturne..flame” stanza, “snicker-snack”).</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration → ring echo (warning repeated as final stanza). Arc follows canonical order clearly.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim canonical lines appear in the last stanza, which repeats exactly the first stanza’s admonition. But the task specifies no line exactly matching canonical poem. However, the repeated stanza matches the model poem's own first stanza, not the canonical poem’s first stanza verbatim. The wording in the final stanza is identical to the first stanza of the model poem (not copying canonical). No line matches canonical poem text exactly aside from canonical coinages reused. So no exact lines from canonical poem other than reused coinages; \"Beware the Furniturne, my son!\" is new wording. So no verbatim canonical lines present.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens reused: “Beware”, “my son!”, “The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!”, “Beware the … and shun the frumious …” reused verbs and canonical phrases. Canonical tokens seem ≤8 distinct: jaws, bite, claws, catch, beware, frumious, whiffling, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish, callooh, callay, chortled, uffish, tumtum are canonical but note model keeps canonical coinages correct with little leftover. Since canonical tokens are below 8 distinct, within limit.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness per stanza similar to canonical: longer lines approximately 8-9 syllables, shorter lines approximately 5-7 syllables, consistent across all quatrains.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: repeated rhymes like “catch”/“shun” appear multiple times including ring echo stanza; overall rhyme pairs 2,4 vary except for ring echo repetition. No exact end word reused >2 times excluding ring stanza. Thus sufficient variety.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: words like “Furniturne”, “spurning-knife”, “Beware” repeated, but no single content word overused above threshold. No overuse >5 or 8% outside ring stanza.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages have at least 4 distinct roots (Furniturne, spurning, Grabbet, Reglet, tillered) well distributed; no single coined suffix dominates over 50%.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-style creature “Furniturne” and follows a Jabberwocky-themed narrative closely. No substitution of unrelated topic.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: motive of heroic caution, preparation, slaying, and celebration as in canonical poem is clear.
