Beware its chime-call, and oh, shun ...\", which is an admonition to the protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before the encounter: Protagonist takes no blade nor shield, but fetches a \"glint-glass\" to reveal wonders and see clearly.

Instead, protagonist observes and reveals truth that no dread was destroyed. No decisive violent or triumphant slaying.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: the penultimate stanza has a call of triumphant boy, and the protagonist tells a truth, but no real jubilant acknowledgement or celebratory homecoming is present. Rather a quiet reflection.

So most stanzas have coinage; borderline but likely yes as each stanza has ≥1 coined term or proper noun.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>A non-canonical creature is named and central: \"Glimmerwing\" is the creature and central to the poem's action (admonition and encounter).</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia presence: no clear bursts like \"snicker-snack\", \"Pop!\", \"Hiss!\", or equivalent. \"Whickered\" and \"rustling\" imply sound but are not clear onomatopoeia bursts. Less than two clear bursts. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration or consonance beyond incidental: some alliterative elements like \"barren/begin\", \"chilling/chirl\" appear but no strong clear alliteration in ≥2 stanzas, seems mild or incidental. No.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: admonition → preparation → encounter → decisive action → return/celebration. This poem has admonition, preparation, encounter in order, but no decisive action and no celebration, so arc incomplete or broken.

Poem uses none of the canonical words (brillig, slithy, toves, etc.) It substitutes all new vocabulary. So canonical budget is definitely ≤8 (zero). Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness per quatrain: longer lines ~8–9 syllables, shorter lines ~5–7. Checking stanza 1 line lengths:\n\n- ’Twas grumm, and umbril shadows fell (7 syllables)\n- Across the barren stubble-scraw; (7 syllables)\n- Did chirl the wind with chilling spell, (7 syllables)\n- And mock the grip of winter’s maw. (7 syllables)\n\nAll lines roughly 7 syllables, no clear alternating longer/shorter lines with the target pattern seen in Jabberwocky. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: End rhyme pairs (2,4) mostly rhyme on limited sets (\"flows\"/\"sows\", \"fray\"/\"day\"), and some repeated endings reappear >2 times across stanzas. So rhyme variety poor. No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No content word appears excessively repeated >5 times or >8% of total content words. Lexical repetition is low; yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages include grumm, umbril, chirl, maw, Glimmerwing, chime-call, thripple-thorn, whickered, scrimmed — at least 5-6 distinct roots without a single suffix dominating.
