Borderline but likely no.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly about a named creature (\"screwy screeb\") in a setting like Jabberwocky, no deviation off-topic: yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: no strong coherent implied subtext or motif beyond surface action (some vague chaos/order metaphor?), but not clearly detectable or consistent across poem.

Well over 8 distinct inventive coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least 1 coinage word invented and novel.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>No non-canonical creature/entity named; mostly abstract entities or environments (\"flicker-flack\", \"talmink-tum\") not clear creature names central to action.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>No clear onomatopoeic bursts like “snicker-snack!” or “Pop!”; no bursts of sound words present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration and consonance present in lines such as \"flicker-flack,\" \"whisper goes,\" \"bade brave hearts,\" and \"scyther sharp in squall and spin,\" in multiple stanzas; meets criterion for multiple stanzas.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: There is a warning, some movement possibly preparation, vague encounter. No clear decisive act or return celebration. Arc incomplete and partially out of canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line is a verbatim copy or exact match from the canonical poem.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens (e.g., \"Jabberwock,\" \"vorpal,\" \"beamish,\" etc.) are not present at all; so ≤8 canonical tokens, meets criterion favoring new coinages.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Line syllables roughly follow longer lines ~8–9 syllables and shorter lines ~5–7; many lines fit this pattern, though some slightly off; overall consistent and tight across all stanzas.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme endings in lines 2 and 4 are varied across stanzas with no exact end word reused >2 times; variety is good.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No single content word is repeated more than 5 times or exceeds 8% frequency given abstract and varied vocabulary.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages have various roots; no single suffix or morphological form dominates over 50%, indicating good variety in coinage formation.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem addresses a different subject than the Jabberwocky topic; instead of a named central creature encounter, it describes nebulous creatures/events (\"murmuration\", \"stubble\", \"ferals\") not related to the Jabberwock; topic adherence fails.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext is ambiguous with some implied naturalistic or mystical undertones but lacks clear motif or coherent implied layer across poem akin to canonical poem’s heroism and caution; thus, no clearly coherent subtext.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>no</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>no</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>"}
