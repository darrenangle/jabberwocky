At least 2 repeated content phrases in final stanza and first stanza - yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition early: The first stanza is a “Warning-wind whispers…” urging caution (“Keep bright eyes…”, “Step not too near…”).

Little or no use of canonical jabberwocky lexemes like “brillig,” “slithy,” “toves,” “wabe,” “borogoves,” “jubjub,” “vorpal,” etc. Canonical token count ≤8, yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness in all quatrain stanzas (long lines 8-9 syll, short 5-7): since not all stanzas are quatrains, full evaluation difficult. The pattern of alternating longer/shorter lines is unclear. Lines tend to be longer and more uniform in length, not matching jabberwocky’s ~8/6 pattern clearly. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: end lines (2,4) often repeat exact rhymes or exact words (e.g., “gear” twice, “clang” twice), no strong variation across stanzas. Not enough varied rhyme for ≥60% stanzas. No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word appears excessively repeated (>5 times or >8%), “movement” repeated several times but below threshold for problem.

Topic of invented creature battle intact, no substitution to a different subject, yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is a faint undertone of vigilance, technological or mechanical danger (“clock-eyed grin,” “engines croon tone,” “ticking hollow,” “wand wrench,” “pocket-glow”).

Each stanza’s line count: stanza 1 = 4 lines, stanza 2 = 4 lines, stanza 3 = 4 lines, stanza 4 = 4 lines, stanza 5 = 4 lines. All stanzas quatrains, total stanzas = 5 (within 5-8).

Other stanzas have some rhymes but strong repetitive end rhymes, so no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza echoes opening stanza with repeated words or refrains. First stanza repeats \"stubble\" 4 times, last stanza also repeats \"stubble\" multiple times and \"gloam\" / \"home\" as internal echoes. At least two repeated content words (\"stubble\", \"gloam/home\" sound alike). So yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early warning/admonition present? First stanza includes \"Beware the murmuration...\" which is a caution to protagonist. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: poem indicates \"We knap the latch of fear with a gleam of steel\" and \"coin new dawn-names\", indicating some preparation/resolution before encounter. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: stanza 3 explicitly mentions \"From stubble's edge the Snickerwold slides in,\" naming creature, arrival of adversary. Clearly an encounter. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: stanza 4 shows action \"We lash the air with clang\", final loud sound \"clang\", Snickerwold reels, final silence closes the field. Implies decisive confrontation and resolution. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: stanza 5 describes drifting back home, lamps dim, tale kept alive, sleep seals the day. A calm return, but no explicit jubilant celebration or exultation line similar to \"O frabjous day!\" in Jabberwocky. Ambiguous. Borderline but no, since jubilation not clearly expressed.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Distinct coinages: New invented words that are not canonical or standard English: \"murmuration\", \"wingle-bells\", \"murble\", \"flindle\", \"gloam\" (some old English?), \"Snickerwold\", \"twick-tack\", \"twang-clang\", \"coin new dawn-names\" (not coinage). Count distinct inventions: wingle-bells, murble, flindle, Snickerwold, twick-tack, twang-clang = 6 distinct coinages (mururation is a real English word). So fewer than 8.

Gloam and murmuration less clear as coinages (gloam is archaic but English), \"murmuration\" is an English word describing starling formations. So stanza 5 no clear coinage. 4/5 stanzas with coinage, not all. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named non-canonical creature/entity central to action: \"Snickerwold\" in stanza 3 is named, not canonical, and central to encounter. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts ≥2: stanza 3 has \"SWISH, hiss,\" and stanza 4 has \"clang\", repeated. At least two onomatopoeic bursts. Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas beyond incidental: \"Wingle-bells clack, wind-snarled shadows skim\" (stanza 1), \"flindle, gloam\" (stanza 2 weaker), \"gust-born spark we lash the air with clang\" (stanza 4), \"coin new dawn-names\" (less). At least 2 stanzas with clear consonance/alliteration. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order conformity: warning (stanza 1 with \"Beware\"), preparation (stanza 2 with steel and naming), encounter (stanza 3 arrival of Snickerwold), decisive action (stanza 4 attack), return/celebration (stanza 5 return home but no celebration). The celebration step weak or missing, so arc order partially but not fully. No.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines from canonical poem? No direct line duplicates from Jabberwocky present. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token budget ≤8: Only \"snicker\" appears truncated inside \"Snickerwold\" (an invented name), no actual canonical tokens from the Jabberwocky poem directly used. So canonical tokens = 0. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines ~8-9 syllables, shorter lines ~5-7 syllables. Sample stanza 1 line lengths: line 1: 13 syll, line 2: ~10, line 3: ~10, line4: ~9 - longer than typical Jabberwocky. Other stanzas vary similarly. So syllable tightness not very close for all quatrain stanzas. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety in (2,4) positions with no overuse: stanza 1 uses all \"stubble\" (all 4 lines rhyme identical), stanza 3 rhyme on \"gloom\" 2x and \"croon\" 2x; stanza 4 uses \"clang\" repeated heavily; stanza 5 ends with \"home, home, stubble, stubble\" with repetition. Overall little variety, overuse of same rhyme words. No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: \"stubble\" used heavily but mostly in lines with it as a thematic word, total content words probably >50 but \"stubble\" repeated >5 times likely >8% content word frequency. So no.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Only 6 distinct coinages of which some suffixes (e.g. \"-clack\", \"-clang\") repeated; roots seem distinct (\"wingle-bells\", \"murble\", \"flindle\", \"Snickerwold\", \"twick\", \"twang\"). Four distinct roots probably, suffixes repeated. Probably yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem does not address Jabberwock or the exact canonical creatures, but it clearly focuses on a battle with a named creature \"Snickerwold\" amid a murmuration over a stubbled field. The topic is a Jabberwocky-style poem about an exotic creature attack in a fantasy setting, so acceptable topic adherence. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Motif of battle with unknown threat, bravery, naming gestures, and return to home. There is an implied undertone of nature's struggle or courage vs threat, subtle but coherent motif across poem. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>no</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}
