Counting distinct coined or non-canonical words: tumblenight, quurl, chittering (borderline English?), snarl-tuned, clack-clamor, snarl-shivered, flash-crack, whir-tide — at least 8 distinct notable coinages (some compound), so yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage: e.g., opening stanza has \"blued\", \"whirl,\" \"tumblenight\" (“tumblenight” especially), second stanza \"quurl\", \"chittering\", \"snarl-tuned\", third stanza \"tines\", \"clack-clamor\", \"snarl-shivered\", fourth stanza \"quurl-blade\", \"snick\", \"flash-crack\", fifth stanza \"whirr-light\", \"calm-clank\", sixth stanza \"whir-tide\".

So yes, more than 2 stanzas show marked alliteration/consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>The story beats follow canonical order: warning (stanza 1), preparation (stanza 2), encounter (stanza 3), decisive act (stanza 4), return & celebration (stanza 5), final stanza echoes start (ring) and ends tale.

No explicit canonical coinages like \"brillig\" etc. appear. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count per line approximates original pattern (~8–9 longer lines, ~5–7 shorter lines in alternating pattern). Examples: stanza 1 lines vary from 7 to 9 syllables; alternating line lengths somewhat consistent; repeated pattern mostly present. So syllable tightness met.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety is limited: many stanzas use repeated rhyme words (\"day/gray\", \"deep/deep\", \"bright/bright\", \"still/still\", \"slow/still\", \"swift/swift\"); end words often repeated exactly or very close, so rhyme variety poor (no variation in end rhyme words excluding ring echo). So no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No content word is overused excessively: \"screw\" appears a few times but not >5 or >8%; lexicon is varied with coinages mostly, so lexical repetition guard held.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show diverse roots: \"tumblenight\", \"quurl\", \"chittering\", \"snarl-\", \"clack-\", \"flash-\", \"whir-\" etc., so at least 4 distinct coinage roots, no single suffix dominates more than 50%—yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence is consistent to a creature-themed poem with a confrontation and victory, echoing Jabberwocky’s theme without deviation; no unrelated topic detected.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>The poem contains a coherent implied layer of struggle against a mechanized foe (the \"blued screw\"), preparation, battle, and triumph, which can be interpreted as a motif of overcoming adversity or defeating an ominous force smoothly integrated across the poem—subtext present.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}
