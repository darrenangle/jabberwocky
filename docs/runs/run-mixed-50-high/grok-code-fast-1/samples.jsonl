Yes, all with coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named non-canonical creature? \"werzle\" and \"blotf\" named and implicated as adversaries. Not canonical creatures from original poem. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia? No clear bursts like \"snicker-snack\" or \"burbled,\" just some \"whir and click\"—mild, not onomatopoeic bursts. Only \"whir and click\" present, which is borderline and not exactly bursts. Need ≥2 bursts; no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas? Examples: \"drivvy groaks,\" \"gyre and gimbal,\" \"swirling sworp\" show some alliteration. \"Decisive twist,\" \"tumps in grotty plight,\" \"blued screws,\" \"rusty gleam.\" Probably at least 2 stanzas with clear alliteration beyond incidental. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order canonical: warning admonition (stanza 2), preparation (3), encounter (4), decisive act (4), return/celebration (5). Sequence correct in canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No exact matches to canonical poem lines. All lines rewritten or coinages altered. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens ≤8? The poem uses \"’Twas brillig,\" \"wabe,\" \"mimsy,\" \"vorpal,\" \"beamish,\" \"snicker-snack\" absent, \"borogoves\" absent, \"mome\" absent. Only a few canonical words preserved: brillig, gyre/gimbal (variant), wabe, mimsy. Probably ≤8 distinct canonical tokens—yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness per quatrain: longer lines ~8-9 syllables, shorter ~5-7. Mixed per stanza. Samples:\n\nStanza 1 lines:  '’Twas brillig, and the drivvy groaks' (7 syll), 'Did gyre and gimbal in the wabe:' (7-8?), 'All mimsy were the flibberwumps,' (7-8), 'And blued screws ached with frothy wafe.' (7-8). Lines roughly even, less clear alternation.\n\nOthers less clear; syllable pattern inconsistent. Overall, syllable pattern is looser than Jabberwocky. Not tight enough for yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes are mostly distinct across stanzas (wabe/wafe, plight/blight, sheen/sheen repeated, grease/ceased, wabe/save). \"Sheen\" repeated exactly twice, within stanza 3 but only once repeated elsewhere. Variety sufficient. No exact end word reused >2 times (excluding ring echo). Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: no content word overused excessively. Most coinages appear no more than twice. Common words like \"the\" etc. are not content words. No word >5 times or 8%. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: many distinct roots (\"drivvy,\" \"groaks,\" \"flibberwumps,\" \"blotf,\" \"werzle,\" \"tumps,\" \"girdle-dorp,\" \"sworp,\" \"onthrayed,\" \"zoggly,\" etc.) No dominant suffix accounts for >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly addresses similar subject—creature hunt akin to Jabberwocky, with named creature(s), weapon/tool, confrontation, and returning triumphant. Matches theme. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: implied theme of struggle against threat, careful preparation, overcoming darkness (\"blued screws,\" \"horrors ceased\"), homecoming with peaceful aftermath. Some subtle undertone present, although more muted than canonical. Coherent implied layer detected. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}
