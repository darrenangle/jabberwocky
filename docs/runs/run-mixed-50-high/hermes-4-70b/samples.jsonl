Counting: 1) lines 1-4; 2) lines 5-8; 3) lines 9-12; last stanza lines 13-16). Wait: last stanza lines are 4 lines? Counting carefully:  \n1: 'Twas satword, and the shifty bards  \n2: Did gyve and hew like fomblight fey.  \n3: All bimsy were the hambles, and the twards  \n4: Beware the Reglet, my seaguy!  \n(stanza 1: 4 lines)\n\n5: Beware the Furnitil, and shun  \n6: Our hanfrails' wary, prinkled haunt.  \n7: So weirdly when the vextface sun  \n8: Pale gleams upon the marquint.  \n(stanza 2: 4 lines)\n\n9: One two!

Total stanza count=4, which is less than the required 5-8 stanzas. So no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter echo requires ≥60% stanzas with alternating longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content-word difference. The meter is inconsistent; no strong alternating syllable pattern or clear content word length differences in most stanzas. The last stanza is shorter and more irregular. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme check on (2,4): First stanza (lines 2&4) rhyme 'fey'/'seaguy'? No direct rhyme, \"fey\" and \"seaguy\" slant rhyme weakly. Second stanza: 'sun'/'marquint' no rhyme. Third stanza 'snicker-snack'/'track' good rhyme. Fourth stanza 'come'/'prise' no rhyme, so 1 of 4 stanzas (25%) has the expected rhyme pattern at lines 2 and 4. Does not meet ≥60%, so no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition requires final stanza echoing opening with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases or refrain. Final stanza repeats \"'Twas brillig\" phrase partially (modified: '’Twas brillig, and the shifty bards') which references first stanza wording ('’Twas satword' vs. ’Twas brillig). Only 1 repeated canonical content word \"’Twas brillig\" from original, but not from own poem. No clear echo within the model poem's own opening lines. No clear ring echo present.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning admonition: First stanza ends with \"Beware the Reglet, my seaguy!\" and second stanza begins with \"Beware the Furnitil, and shun\" which constitutes clear admonitions. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation armament: No clear protagonist preparation or tool pickup or waiting described; no lines indicating a preparation scene. No.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter confrontation: No explicit encounter scene where protagonist and creature meet; third stanza \"One two! One two! And through and through / The vorpaled blade went snicker-snack!\" implies an action, but no explicit description of meeting or confrontation. Minimal but arguably present; borderline but safer to say yes since battle described.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying decisive action: \"The vorpaled blade went snicker-snack!\" implies decisive killing/blade action. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return celebration: No stanza or lines describe return or celebration or jubilation after the act. No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Count distinct invented words not canonical or standard English: satword, shifty, gyve, fomblight, fey, bimsy, hambles, twards, Reglet, seaguy, Furnitil, hanfrails, prinkled, vextface, marquint, wonkled, chatboards, bangel, slackered, snicksnifed, prise. Many are coinages; well over 8 distinct coinages. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza has at least one coinage:  \n1st stanza: satword, shifty, gyve, fomblight, bimsy, hambles, twards, Reglet, seaguy  \n2nd stanza: Furnitil, hanfrails, prinkled, vextface, marquint  \n3rd stanza: wonkled, chatboards, bangel, slackered  \n4th stanza: snicksnifed, prise - also \"brillig\" (canonical), shifty (coinage)  \nYes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: Named creature \"Reglet\" is central to action (\"Beware the Reglet\", and question \"And hast thou slain the Reglet?\"). Not canonical. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"snicker-snack\" occurs once (canonical), \"One two! One two!\" attempts rhythmic bursts but not onomatopoeia. No other onomatopoeic bursts like Pop!, Hiss! etc. Only one canonical onomatopoeia. Not ≥2. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas: 1st stanza has some alliteration \"shifty bards\", \"fomblight fey\", \"bimsy\" \"hambles\" \"twards\". 2nd stanza: \"Furnitil\", \"hanfrails' wary, prinkled\", somewhat consonance. 3rd stanza and 4th less clear. At least two stanzas show clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order (warning → prep → encounter → action → return): Warning is present early; preparation is absent; encounter/action conflated; return/celebration absent. Order broken or incomplete. No.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: Final stanza uses \"'Twas brillig, and the shifty bards\\nDid gyve and hew like fomblight fey.\", so \"'Twas brillig...\" exact phrase is repeated from canonical poem's opening line, though slightly altered. Exact canonical line is \"'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\", but here \"and the shifty bards\" is substituted, so no exact word-for-word canonical line used. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget ≤8 distinct tokens: The poem uses \"brillig\", \"gyve\"(not canonical), \"snicker-snack\"(canonical), \"vorpaled\" (coinage from 'vorpal'), \"Reglet\"(coinage), \"shifty\" coinage, \"fey\"(not canonical, archaic English), so counting only canonical tokens: brillig, gyre not used, snicker-snack, vorpal (used as vorpaled), Possibly borderline but seems ≤8 canonical tokens used. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines ~8-9 syllables, shorter lines ~5-7 in each stanza. Checking stanza 1:  \n'Twas satword, and the shifty bards (7 syll)  \nDid gyve and hew like fomblight fey. (8 syll)  \nAll bimsy were the hambles, and the twards (9 syll)  \nBeware the Reglet, my seaguy! (7 syll)  \nLines somewhat irregular; alternating longer/shorter unclear; pattern not tight or consistent across all stanzas, so no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety across stanzas 2,4 ends: \"fey\"/\"seaguy\" weak rhyme, \"sun\"/\"marquint\" no rhyme, \"snicker-snack\"/\"track\" good, \"come\"/\"prise\" no rhyme, so limited rhyme variety and not meeting criteria. No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No obviously overused content word repeated >5 times or >8% of content words. \"Reglet\" repeated only a few times (2-3). No overuse. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Over 20 coinages visible with many distinct roots, no dominant suffix over 50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem addresses a Jabberwocky-like scenario with a named creature \"Reglet\" and a battle theme similar to original poem. Thema matches. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: No clear coherent implied motif or subtext beyond surface action; no clear deeper theme or undertone emerges consistently. No.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>"}
