Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a poem in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\" with the prompt \"reglet and furniture\". Let me start by recalling the key features of \"Jabberwocky\". It's known for its nonsense words, playful language, and a narrative structure that includes a warning, preparation, encounter, decisive act, and return. The poem also has a consistent meter, rhyme scheme, and uses alliteration, onomatopoeia, and made-up creatures.\n\nFirst, the title should be catchy and include a nonsense word. Maybe \"The Reglet's Requiem\" – \"reglet\" is part of the prompt, and \"requiem\" suggests a mournful or final confrontation.\n\nNext, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" uses quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. I need to maintain that. Let me outline the arc: warning from a parent figure about the Reglet, preparation by the protagonist, encounter with the creature among furniture, a battle where the Reglet is defeated, and a return home. The ending should echo the beginning, so maybe repeating the warning phrase.\n\nNow, the coinages. The original uses words like \"slithy\", \"mome\", \"galumphing\". I need to invent similar nonsense terms related to furniture. Words like \"burble\", \"frumious\", \"clumplenax\" (a type of furniture?), \"sulkling\" (maybe a creature). \"Snicker-snack\" is from the original, so I should avoid verbatim copying but maybe use something similar, like \"flibulux\" for the sword. Onomatopoeia: \"Blub\" for sound, \"whirled\" for movement.\n\nAlliteration: \"frolicking fronds\", \"gilded gauntlet\", \" dojo’d dresser drawers\". The creature name \"Reglet\" is given; maybe describe it as \"sulkling Reglet\" with \"eyes aglow like embers\". \n\nMeter should be consistent, mostly trochaic tetrameter. Let me check syllable counts. Each line should be around 8 syllables. For example: \"‘Beware the Reglet, my child, it’s near,\" – 10 syllables. Hmm, need to tighten. Maybe \"‘Beware the Reglet, my child, now near,\" – 9. Still a bit long. Maybe adjust: \"‘Beware the Reglet, my child, draw near,\" – 9. Alternatively, \"‘Beware the Reglet, my son, it’s near,\" – 9. Maybe acceptable as Carroll sometimes varies.\n\nRhyme variety: Use different rhyming words, not repeating the same endings. Each quatrain should have a unique rhyme sound.\n\nWarning in the first stanza, preparation in the second, encounter in the third, decisive act in the fourth, return in the fifth. Then the final stanza mirrors the first.\n\nSubtext: Perhaps the Reglet represents a childhood fear or the dangers of mundane objects (furniture) coming alive. Defeating it signifies overcoming fear.\n\nNeed to ensure no verbatim copying from \"Jabberwocky\". Instead of \"vorpal blade\", use \"flibulux foil\". Instead of \"burble\" maybe \"chortle\" but check if that's in the original. \"Burble\" is in the original, so avoid. Use \"simper\" or \"murmur\".\n\nCoinage spread: Use invented words throughout, not just in one stanza. \"Frumious\", \"clumplenax\", \"gr Redux\", \"flibulux\", \"sulkling\", \"mimsy\", \"galumphing\" (though \"galumphing\" is from the original, so replace with \"throcklepox\" or \"flibbertigibbet\".\n\nWait, \"galumphing\" is from the original, so I need to avoid that. Maybe \"throcklepoxing\" as a verb.\n\nSyllable tightness: Each line should be roughly 8 syllables. Let's draft a stanza:\n\n\"Beware the Reglet, my son, now near,\nWith frumious claws and a mimsy sneer.\nIt prowls the clumplenax at night’s dull peer,\nAnd snores in the soffa’s lee, my dear!\"\n\nBreaking down syllables: 9, 10, 11, 10. Hmm, too long. Need to shorten. Maybe:\n\n\"Beware the Reglet, my son, so near,\nWith claws frumious, mimsy sneer.\nIt prowls clumplenax when dusk peers here,\nAnd burrows in soffas, my dear!\"\n\nNow syllables: 8, 8, 10, 8. Closer. \"Prowls clumplenax\" – maybe \"prowls through clumplenax\" adds a syllable but clarifies. Alternatively, \"It prowls the clumplenax at dusk's peer\" – 10 syllables. Maybe acceptable with some variation.\n\nRhyme scheme ABAB: near/sneer/dear. Wait, near, sneer, peer, dear. That's AABB. Need ABAB. Let's adjust:\n\n\"Beware the Reglet, my son, so sly,\nWith frumious claws and a mimsy sigh.\nIt prowls the clumplenax when dusk draws nigh,\nAnd burrows in soffas—pass by, pass by!\"\n\nNow rhymes: sly/sigh/nigh/by – ABAB. Better.\n\nProceeding through each stanza, ensuring coinages, onomatopoeia, alliteration, and the narrative arc. Check for repetition of words and rhymes. Use a mix of real and nonsense furniture terms: clumplenax, soffa, dressing chest, dojo'd drawers.\n\nIn the encounter stanza, use onomatopoeia: \"Blub blub blub!\" and \"Whirr-thwack\". The decisive act involves using the \"flibulux foil\" to strike the Reglet. The return home should mirror the warning, with the protagonist now giving the warning, showing growth.\n\nFinally, ensure the title is included and the ring (ending echoes beginning) is present. Subtext about overcoming fear through courage and preparedness.\n</think>\n\n**The Reglet’s Requiem**  \n\n‘Beware the Reglet, my son, so sly,  \nWith frumious claws and a mimsy sigh.  \nIt prowls the clumplenax when dusk draws nigh,  \nAnd burrows in soffas—pass by, pass by!’  \n\nHe grasped a flibulux foil, all agleam,  \nGilded gauntlet and socks of esteem.  \nThrough wobblewood wardrobes, he throcklepoxed upstream,  \nWhere dresser drawers dojo’d in moonlit scheme.  \n\nA snicker, a simper, a clatter, a *crack*—  \nOut lurched the Reglet, all splinter and wrack:  \nMaw bristling brads, eyes aglow like clinker,  \nIt gnawed the mullion, all mome and blinker.  \n\n‘Blub blub blub!’ as it vaulted a chest,  \n‘Whirr-*thwack*!’ went the foil through its crested nest.  \nStraight through the rump (all moth-wing’d, unblessed),  \nIt skittered, squawkling, and *floopen’d*—reft!  \n\nHe Jubjubbed homewards, all flibbertigibbet,  \nThrough mushafs moping, through jim-jam and gibbet.  \nAnd when the dawn de-escalates the cobalt,  \nNone dares invoke what the Reglet… had *wrought*.  \n\n‘Beware the Reglet, my child,’ now *he’ll* cry,  \n‘With frumious claws and a mimsy sigh…’  \nFor some strange sort of circular mercy,  \nThe tail that travailed… shall tyrannize nigh.", "info": {"topic": "reglet and furniture"}, "reward": 1.0, "label": "high", "criteria_yes": 24, "metrics": {"composite_score": 1.0, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>Title line present and distinct: \"The Reglet’s Requiem\".</C1_think>\n<C2_think>Six stanzas total, all quatrains (4-line stanzas), count 6 is within 5–8 range, quatrain shape correct.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Alternate line syllable lengths mostly follow longer/shorter pattern with about ≥2 content-word difference in ≥60% of stanzas.

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this request. The user wants a poem in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\" with the prompt \"blued screw in a movement.\" The grading criteria are extensive, so I need to make sure each is addressed.\n\nFirst, the title should reflect the prompt. Maybe \"The Blued Screw's FrabjulSpin\"? It has a Carroll-esque sound with \"Frabjul\" from \"frabjous\" and \"Spin\" tying to movement.\n\nNext, quatrains. \"Jabberwocky\" uses four-line stanzas, so I'll stick to that structure. Each stanza needs a consistent meter, probably iambic tetrameter. Let's check syllable count to maintain tightness.\n\nRhyme is important. Carroll uses ABAB rhyme scheme. I'll plan each stanza with that in mind, varying the sounds to meet the rhyme variety requirement.\n\nRing, meaning the ending echoes the beginning. The first stanza starts with \"Twas brillig\" and ends with \"the burbly jam.\" The last stanza should revisit the first line and the jam, perhaps transforming it.\n\nThe narrative arc requires warning, preparation, encounter, decisive act, return. Let's outline: 1) warning about the Blued Screw (2) gathering tools (3) encountering the creature (4) using the jam to stop it (5) returning with the jam changed.\n\nCoinages are crucial. Carroll invents words like \"frumious.\" I'll need to create new words related to mechanics and movement. \"Snickerwack,\" \"flimflam blades,\" \"wizzlewhack,\" \"Flish,\" \"glug,\" \"flarp,\" \"jinkleplack,\" \"floozyjig,\" \"Snazzleplop,\" \"snizzlefraze,\" \"burbleness.\" Spread them across stanzas.\n\nCreature naming: The Blued Screw is the main creature. Maybe add a \"Flish\" to accompany it. Make sure they have unique names with some alliteration.\n\nOnomatopoeia: Words like \"Snickerwack,\" \"glug,\" \"flarp,\" \"jinkleplack,\" \"Snazzleplop\" should imitate sounds.\n\nAlliteration: \"Burble brew of bubbly blue,\" \"flimflam blades,\" \"wizzlewhack,\" \"floozyjig,\" \"snizzlefraze.\" Use throughout.\n\nAvoid verbatim copying from Carroll. Use similar structure but new words. Watch the canonical budget—limit words like \"frumious\" or \"galumphing.\" Maybe use \"slithy\" but check if that's allowed.\n\nSyllable tightness: Each line should be around 8 syllables. \"Twas brillig and the slimsnacks\" is 8. Check each line.\n\nRhyme variety: Different endings each stanza. Stanza 1: low/throw/below/jam. Stanza 2: go/approaches/know/clue. Etc. Ensure no repetition.\n\nRepetition guard: Avoid repeating coinages or lines. Each stanza introduces new elements.\n\nSubtext: The poem might suggest dealing with a problem (the Blued Screw) requiring cleverness (the jam), not just force. The jam's transformation (from burbly to glimmer) implies change after overcoming the challenge.\n\nPutting it all together, ensuring each stanza follows the arc and incorporates all required elements. Check for meter, rhyme, and participation in the overall narrative. Revise any lines that don't meet the criteria. Make sure the title reflects the content and the ring ties back to the start.\n</think>\n\n**The Blued Screw's FrabjulSpin**  \n\nTwas brillig and the slimsnacks  \nGyring under groggy low,  \nAloft the flarpflaps chatter—  \n\"Shun the burbly jam below!\"  \n\nThey frumple all the snickerwacks,  \nThey snarf the glimmer where’er you go,  \nA Flish with flimflam blades approaches—  \n\"Beware the Blued Screw’s wizzlewhack show!\"  \n\nI seized the wuggle’s wumplenooks,  \nThe jam in bubbly vials laid,  \nTo fix the gears that glug and fizzle,  \nTame the Screw’s snizzlefraze parade.  \n\nDosetwo—no!

Each stanza should tell part of the story: warning, preparation, encounter, decisive act, return, and a ring that echoes the beginning.\n\nRhyme scheme is important. \"Jabberwocky\" uses ABAB, so I'll stick to that. Need to ensure varied rhymes and avoid repetition.\n\nCoinages are crucial. I need to invent new words that sound plausible, like \"snickerfrack\" or \"flumplenooks,\" making sure they fit the meter and contribute to the imagery. Spread these coinages throughout the poem without overusing them.\n\nCreature naming: besides \"stubblewings,\" maybe \"gleeboks\" or \"thimblefish\" to populate the landscape. Onomatopoeia like \"chirr\" or \"squelch\" adds auditory texture.\n\nAlliteration should be sprinkled in, such as \"slimy slur\" or \"froth-fretted,\" enhancing the musicality.\n\nThe narrative arc must follow the prescribed order: warning from the parent, preparation with a weapon, encountering the creature, a decisive action (maybe using the weapon), returning home, and ending with a line that mirrors the opening.\n\nSyllable tightness is key. Each line should be around 8 syllables, maintaining the rhythm without forcing words.\n\nCanonical budget means limiting words from the original \"Jabberwocky.\" Avoid \"frumious,\" \"galumphing,\" etc., but keep the essence through new coinages.\n\nSubtext might involve the balance between nature's beauty and danger, or the transition from innocence to experience after the encounter.\n\nLet me draft the first stanza with the warning. Something like:\n\n\"Beware the Stubblewings, my son,\nWith snickerfrack and spine,\nThey churn the dusk to froth-fretted dun—\nBeware the Thimblefish's brine.\"\n\nCheck meter and rhyme. \"Son\" and \"spine\" rhyme, \"dun\" and \"brine\" slant rhyme. Coinages \"Stubblewings,\" \"snickerfrack,\" \"Thimblefish.\"\n\nNext, preparation. Introduce a weapon, maybe \"glintknife\" or \"thornstick.\"\n\nHe grasped the glintknife's jagged tooth,\nAnd shouldered a thorned spar,\nBy sloshfells where the glibbins slooth\nIn lavalocked sprakkar.\"\n\n\"Inkblack\" sloughs and \"glibbins slooth\" create vivid, eerie scenes. \"Splink\" as onomatopoeia.\n\nBuild the encounter with the murmuration. Use onomatopoeia like \"squelch\" and \"chirr.\"\n\nThe murmurwraithe began to seethe:\nA thousand wings in blare,\nEach chirr a spark on highbeam sheathe\nAs splink-bursts split the air.\"\n\nThen the decisive act, using the glintknife. Maybe disrupting the murmuration.\n\nHe lunged, the glintknife slit the haze,\nUnraveling the thrall,\nAnd strewéd skies with tatters' daze,\nThe Stubblewings' sharp fall.\"\n\nReturn home, showing the aftermath. Echoing the warning.\n\nHe strode through sloshfells, flumplenooks'\nPapercut tongues now still,\nWhere Thimblefish in briney brooks\nNo longer nipped his will.\"\n\nFinally, the ring to close the poem, repeating the warning with a twist.\n\nBeware the Stubblewings, my son—\nThe frost now caps the scar;\nHe bears the tale, the feat undone,\nAnd dusk's blandished star.\"\n\nCheck for adherence to all criteria: title, quatrains, meter, rhyme, ring, narrative order, coinages, onomatopoeia, alliteration, syllable count, limited lexical borrowing. Ensure no verbatim lines from Carroll and that the subtext of overcoming fear or the fleeting nature of challenges is present.\n</think>\n\n**The Stubblewings' Thrall**  \n\nBeware the Stubblewings, my son,  \nWith snickerfrack and spine,  \nThey churn the dusk to froth-fretted dun—  \nBeware the Thimblefish's brine.  \n\nHe grasped the glintknife's jagged tooth,  \nAnd shouldered a thorned spar,  \nBy sloshfells where the glibbins slooth  \nIn lavalocked sprakkar.  \n\nHe trekked through inkblack slurries, slow,  \nWhere gleeboks groan and breed,  \nTill splink-bursts split the air aglow—  \nA murmurwraithe ahead.  \n\nThe murmurwraithe began to seethe:  \nA thousand wings in blare,  \nEach chirr a spark on highbeam sheathe  \nAs splink-bursts split the air.  \n\n\"Beware—yet nearer, Ven!\" he cried,  \nBut thimbles zinged his shanks,  \nAs Stubblewings in mawlike pride  \nUnravelled dusk to blanks.  \n\nHe lunged, the glintknife slit the haze,  \nUnraveling the thrall,  \nAnd strewéd skies with tatters' daze,  \nThe Stubblewings' sharp fall.  \n\nHe strode through sloshfells, flumplenooks'  \nPapercut tongues now still,  \nWhere Thimblefish in briney brooks  \nNo longer nipped his will.  \n\nBeware the Stubblewings, my son—  \nThe frost now caps the scar;  \nHe bears the tale, the feat undone,  \nAnd dusk's blandished star.", "info": {"topic": "murmuration over stubble"}, "reward": 1.0, "label": "high", "criteria_yes": 24, "metrics": {"composite_score": 1.0, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>Title is present on a standalone first line: “The Stubblewings' Thrall”</C1_think>\n<C2_think>8 stanzas total; every stanza is 4 lines (quatrains).
