Also, echo the opening at the end but avoid verbatim lines. Need to limit canonical words, so steer clear of direct references to the original.\n\nStarting with the title. \"Jabberwocky\" uses a made-up word, so maybe something like \"Flumplenax\" or \"Snickerwisp\". Let's brainstorm. \"The Mimsy Underpass\" – mimsy is from the original, but maybe that's too direct. Wait, the user said to avoid canonical words. So create a new term. \"The Gleebloop's Echo\" – Gleebloop as the creature?\n\nStanza 1: Warning. Introduce the setting and the danger. Underpass echo. Maybe something like \"Beware the Gleebloop's echoing sneer,\" – includes the creature and onomatopoeia. Rhyme scheme ABAB. Need alliteration. \"Where wizzlewhacks wobble and groan\" – alliteration with 'w'. Coinage: wizzlewhacks.\n\nStanza 2: Preparation. The protagonist readies for the encounter. \"With flumplenux in fist, flibulous and bright,\" – flumplenux as a weapon, flibulous as an adjective. Onomatopoeia here could be \"chortle\" or \"clang\". Then action: \"Tread the dark where glorples splat,\" – glorples as another creature or obstacle, splat as onomatopoeia.\n\nStanza 3: Encounter/slay. The battle. \"It jinked and jim-jammed with jaws agape,\" – jinked as movement, jim-jammed alliteration. Onomatopoeia: \"Blew a blast of blerp that made bones shake,\" – blerp. Defeat the creature: \"I lunged with a 'yip' and a flick of the wrist,\" – yip. Result: \"the Gleebloop dissolved in a fizzled heap,\" – fizzled.\n\nStanza 4: Return/celebration. Returning home victorious. \"Now I stroll where the whimwhams play,\" – whimwhams. Onomatopoeia: \"chime\". Alliteration: \"wistful winds\". Echo the opening: \"Beware the Gleebloop’s echoing sneer,\" altered to \"For fearsome echoes now faintly peer,\" to avoid verbatim but mirror the warning.\n\nCheck for new coinages in each stanza: wizzlewhacks, flumplenux, glorples, jinked/jim-jammed, blerp, whimwhams. Named creature: Gleebloop. Onomatopoeia: sneer, groan, chortle, clang, splat, blerp, yip, fizzled, chime. Alliteration throughout. Rhyme scheme ABAB each stanza.

Echo the opening at the end. Avoid verbatim lines; limit canonical words.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a poem about morning fog in the style of \"Jabberwocky\". Let me recall what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. Lewis Carroll uses made-up words, playful language, neologisms, and a rhythmic, galloping meter. The structure is a ballad with ABAB rhyme scheme. The user also specified a title, lively alternating cadence, new coinages each stanza, a named creature, onomatopoeia, alliteration, and an arc from warning to preparation, encounter/slay, return/celebration, echoing the opening at the end. Avoid verbatim lines and limit canonical words.\n\nFirst, the title. It should be catchy and include a made-up word. Maybe something like \"The Fogwyrms of Morn\" or \"Beware the Dawnsmoor\". Let's brainstorm. \"The Fogwyrms of Morn\" sounds good, has the creature name and setting.\n\nWarning stanza: Start with a caution, like \"Beware the Fogwyrms...\" Introduce the creature and the danger. Use alliteration, like \"squelch of sullen skies\". Need a new coinage here, \"Fogwyrms\". Onomatopoeia maybe \"hiss\" or \"squelch\".\n\nPreparation: The protagonist readies for the encounter. Maybe \"gadger-staff\" as a coinage. \"Jabberwocky\" uses terms like \"vorpal blade\", so creating similar gear. Alliteration in \"stiffen, strive, snare\". Action verbs and prep.\n\nEncounter/slay: The battle. Create a dramatic fight scene. Use onomatopoeia like \"WHUMPH\", \"squelch\", \"thwong\". Coinages: \"mistjaws\", \"gutter-gloom\". Alliteration \"twirling tethers\", \"gutter-gloom\".\n\nReturn/celebration: Victory, return home. Echo the opening. \"Dawn’s keen blade\" to mirror \"squelch of sullen skies\". Celebratory tone, \"mead” and “huzzahs\". Coinage \"brine-bell\".\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme ABAB each quatrain. Each stanza has four lines, alternating rhymes. Cadence should be lively, so maybe trochaic tetrameter like the original.\n\nEnsure each stanza has a new coinage and the creature is named (Fogwyrms). Onomatopoeia and alliteration in each. Arc progression: warning (first stanza), preparation (second), encounter (third), return (fourth), and the final line echoes the opening.\n\nLet me draft each stanza step by step, checking for all elements. Avoid repeating any lines from \"Jabberwocky\", use original terms. Read aloud to test rhythm.\n\nFirst stanza: warning. \"Beware the Fogwyrms, my son! / The squelch of sullen skies\" – alliteration and coinage. \"Hushing hills in hiss\" – onomatopoeia and action.\n\nSecond stanza: preparation. \"Take grip of gadger-staff, / Stiffen, strive, nor snare thy will\" – coinage \"gadger-staff\", alliteration. \"Lest the murk’s maw thee still\" – warning.\n\nThird stanza: encounter. \"With WHUMPH, they lurch from the moor— / Mistjaws, leering wide\" – onomatopoeia, coinage \"mistjaws\". \"Twirling tethers I’ll snare, / Slay the gutter-gloom inside\" – action and coinage.\n\nFourth stanza: return. \"Then homeward, where chimneys cheep, / Dawn’s keen blade the haze doth part\" – alliteration, echoes the opening. \"Brew of brine-bell mead / And huzzahs in thy heart\" – celebration, coinage \"brine-bell\".\n\nCheck the echo of opening in the last line. The final line should mirror the first. First line: \"Beware the Fogwyrms, my son!\" Last line: \"And huzzahs in thy heart\" – not exact, but the closing line of the last stanza is \"And huzzahs in thy heart\" while the first line is the warning. Maybe need a stronger echo. Perhaps repeat \"Beware the Fogwyrms...\" at the end, but the user said to avoid verbatim lines. Alternatively, use similar phrasing. The last line of the poem should echo the opening warning. In the current draft, the last line is about celebration, so maybe adjust the final line to tie back. Hmm, tricky. Let me see the example structure. The user said \"Echo the opening at the end\". In the \"Jabberwocky\", the first and last lines are the same. But since the user says to avoid verbatim lines, perhaps paraphrase. The current last line is \"And huzzahs in thy heart\"—maybe not enough. Let me adjust the final stanza's closing to something like \"Beware the Fogwyrms...\" but in a different form. For example, the final line could be \"Beware the Fogwyrms of morn!\" which ties back to the title and opening. That would work. So revising the last stanza to end with that line. Yes. So the final stanza becomes:\n\nThen homeward, where hearths hush-high,\nDawn’s keen blade the haze doth part—\nBrew of brine-bell mead, and I’ll cry,\n\"Beware the Fogwyrms of morn!\" \n\nThis way, the last line echoes the opening warning, using the title phrase and completing the arc. That fits the requirement.\n\nNow check for new coinages in each stanza: Fogwyrms (1), gadger-staff (2), mistjaws, gutter-gloom (3), brine-bell (4). Each stanza has at least one new term. Onomatopoeia: squelch, hiss, WHUMPH, cheep. Alliteration in each line. Rhyme scheme ABAB for each quatrain. Cadence is lively, trochaic. Arc is covered: warning, prep, battle, return with echo. Looks good. Now title it as \"The Fogwyrms of Morn\".\n</think>\n\n**The Fogwyrms of Morn**  \n\nBeware the Fogwyrms, my son!  \nThe squelch of sullen skies  \nHushing hills in hiss—begun,  \nThey creep with glassy eyes.  \n\nTake grip of gadger-staff,  \nStiffen, strive, nor snare thy will,  \nLest the murk’s maw thee still,  \nA lump in lurching lair-drift.  \n\nWith WHUMPH, they lurch from the moor—  \nMistjaws, leering wide,  \nGutter-gloom, they’d have my hide!  \nI swing—thwong!

The rhyme scheme should alternate between ABAB or ABCB. Let me check each stanza as I go. The first line should be a warning, so maybe \"Beware the Mome that stalks the floor...\" Mome is a term from the original, but here it's a creature in the conference room. Then introduce the setting with made-up words like \"glitz\" and \"flumplenooks\" to describe the room's gadgets. Need some alliteration here, like \"click of PowerPoints.\"\n\nOnomatopoeia is important. Words like \"flarp,\" \"squelch,\" \"chug,\" \"whimper,\" \"blorp,\" \"zestle,\" \"flim,\" \"flam.\" These should fit naturally into the actions. The second stanza is preparation: \"Take the Vorpal Pen, with care...\" Vorpal is from the original, but paired with a pen for a meeting context. Mention \"STATUS\" as a mysterious term, and \"FEEZLE-BLAST\" as a device. Alliteration in \"frazzled fronds\" and \"brew of Biz-Buzz.\"\n\nThird stanza is the encounter. The Mome attacks with a \"flarp\" and \"squelch.\" The protagonist uses the Vorpal Pen, which \"squelches\" and \"chugs.\" The Mome withers with a \"whimper\" and \"blorp.\" The fourth stanza is the return and celebration.
