Stanzas mostly quatrains (4 lines each). Number of stanzas is between 5 and 8. All stanzas appear to have 4 lines each. So yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter pattern requires ≥60% stanzas have alternating longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content words difference. The meter is irregular, many lines with many invented words obscure counting. Some stanzas have roughly alternating line lengths, but many lines similar or inconsistent. Hard to confirm clear alternating meter in ≥60% stanzas. Tentatively no (too irregular).</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Check rhyme of lines 2 and 4 in ≥60% stanzas. Close rhymes or slant rhymes seen often (e.g. “mire” / “vows” no rhyme in stanza 1; stanza 2 “grim” / “delight” no; stanza 3 “fleam” / “jib” no; stanza 4 “puff” / “skin” no; stanza 5 “brow” / “away” no exact rhyme; stanza 6 “dusk” / “clink” no; stanza 7 last lines repeat similar phrasing but no rhyme. So rhymes (2,4) mostly absent or weakly related. Probably no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Does the final stanza echo the opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words or clear refrain? The first stanza includes “reglet” and “ravelry”. The final stanza uses “reglet” and repeats “Whap! – the glimber! crack! the brow!”. There is repetition of “reglet” and onomatopoeic bursts “Whap!” and “crack!” matching earlier stanza 5. Also “flicker-springs” and “rattle-luff” recur unaltered. So some strong ring echo elements. Yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Is there an early warning or admonition? The first stanza begins with “Beware the reglet …” so there is a clear admonition to beware. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Is there preparation or armament before the encounter? No clear protagonist taking a weapon or making preparations is evident. The poem uses abstract imagery but no clear resolve or tool acquisition before the clash. No.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Is there a clear encounter or confrontation? Stanza 4 describes “’Twas not a cog … It snapped the sill and tore the skin!”, stanza 5 describes “whap!”, “crack!” and a rattler whirling and crumpling the foe. These imply an encounter between the reglet (adversary) and an opponent (implied). So yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Is there a decisive act resolving tension? Stanza 5’s “whap!”, “crack!”, the foe crumples and “the reglet’s spine went crank!—away!” indicates a decisive action. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Is there a return or celebration at the end? The last stanzas seem more abstract and melancholy. The last full stanza mentions “furniture sighed: All… is… ink.” which feels more like a resigned or ominous ending rather than jubilant return. No clear jubilant return or celebration. No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented coinages (excluding canonical listed words and standard English). Many unique coinages: reglet, rafterman, ravelry, flicker-springs, thrumms, winkers, frabjous (canonical), crust-sprocket, shiver-rails, clatter-glooms, lilt, fleam, wobble-weights, tremble-sweam, creeper-chin, shaggy-jib, rattle-luff, grumble-eyes, twitch-grin, glimber, rattler, furl, flumm, rattle-crown, flicker-springs, crumb-sprocket, etc. Much more than 8 distinct coined words. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Does each stanza contain ≥1 coinage? Quickly scanning, every stanza has multiple coined words (e.g., stanza 1: reglet, ravelry, flicker-springs, thrumms, winkers; stanza 2: frabjous, crust-sprocket, shiver-rails; stanza 3: clatter-glooms, fleam, wobble-weights, tremble-sweam, shaggy-jib; stanza 4: reglet-tongued, rattle-luff, grumble-eyes, twitch-grin; stanza 5: glimber, rattler, crank; stanza 6: furl, flumm; stanza 7: furniture, flicker-springs, crumb-sprocket, rattle-luff). Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Is a non-canonical creature/entity named and central? “Reglet” is clearly a creature/adversary, not canonical. The rattler and glimber seem like parts or allied entities but “reglet” is main adversary. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Are there ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts? The poem uses “whap!”, “crack!”, “snap!”, “thrum”, “shush”, “thaw”, “snapped”, “tore”. Of these “whap!” and “crack!” are clear onomatopoeic bursts, “snap” also frequent. Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Are there ≥2 stanzas with clear alliteration/consonance? Stanza 1: “flicker-springs and lurching boughs”, “thrumms beneath the winkers’ vows” moderate; stanza 2: “frabjous dust-veil, frothless, grim” strong repeated ‘f’ sounds; stanza 3: “clatter-glooms with lilt and fleam”, “wobble-weights by tremble-sweam” have repeated W, L, and S sounds; stanza 4: “rattle-luff”, “grumble-eyes”, “twitch-grin” grouped fricatives and consonants; definitely multiple stanzas with clear alliteration. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza 1) present; preparation (no clear preparation or armament) missing; encounter (stanza 4-5) present; decisive act (stanza 5) yes; return/celebration (no) no. Partial arc order present but not full canonical order. So no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines exactly verbatim from canonical poem. The poem uses some canonical words (e.g., frabjous), but no line exactly matches canonical lines. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens ≤8? The poem uses some canonical words e.g., frabjous, but largely new coinage. Canonical tokens are minimal and do not dominate. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines ~8–9 syllables, shorter ~5–7, alternating. The lines vary: “Beware the reglet in the ravelry” (8 syll), “Where furniture dreams in moonlit mire” (8), then “It thrumms beneath the winkers’ vows” (7), and other lines often longer or irregular length. No consistent alternating longer/shorter pattern for ≥60% stanzas. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: No consistent rhyme scheme discernible, so (2,4) rhymes highly varied or mostly absent. The rhymes are not reused in exact form >2 times due to rarity overall. Yes (since little repetition in rhyme words).</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No single content word overused extremely often. “Reglet” appears several times but not over 5 times or 8% of all content words; same for other terms. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages appear from many distinct roots - e.g. reglet, rattle-luff, flicker-springs, crust-sprocket, tremble-sweam, wobble-weights, glimber, rattler, grumble-eyes, twitch-grin, clatter-glooms, shiver-rails, shush, fleam, fur, flumm. No single suffix accounts for >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a fantastical encounter with a creature “reglet,” similar to Jabberwocky, not diverging into unrelated subject. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied layer: The poem’s “reglet” and mysterious furniture realm, the clash and aftermath, plus repeated words like “furniture sighed: All is ink” suggest a motif of decay, conflict, and quiet loss. An undertone of a struggle in an eerie environment seems present, so yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}
