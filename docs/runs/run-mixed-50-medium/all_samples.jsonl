{"i": 0, "prompt": "Write a poem about underpass echo in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem. Use a few invented coinages and a named creature. Avoid copying lines from the original.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about underpass echo in the style of \"Jabberwocky\". Let me recall what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. Carroll uses made-up words that sound meaningful and playful. The poem has a rhythmic, lyrical flow with a consistent meter, probably iambic tetrameter. There's also a narrative structure with a hero facing a fantastical creature.\n\nFirst, I need to invent a title that's catchy and has a portmanteau or neologism, like \"Frabjous\" or \"Jabberwock\". Maybe something like \"The Underpass Grimbul\" or \"Echoflux Jaws\". Wait, \"Glintzenwurm\" came up before. Let me check if that's used. Maybe \"Glintzenwurm\" as the creature. It should have a name that sounds menacing but whimsical.\n\nNext, the setting: an underpass. I need to describe the environment with vivid, fantastical imagery. Use words that evoke both the real and the imaginary. Instead of \"underpass\", maybe \"shadow-vault\" or \"dusktube\". The echo itself can be a character or a force. Maybe the echo is caused by the creature.\n\nInvented coinages: \"flumplenax\" for a 混乱, \"snickerwhin\" for a sound, \"glibblejaws\" for something that chatters. The creature could be the \"Glintzenwurm\" with \"pricklewings\" and \"glintzenclaws\". The echo could be \"the ululation\" or \"echoflux\".\n\nStructure: Start with a warning, like \"Beware the Glintzenwurm\". Then describe the approach to the underpass, the sounds, the encounter with the creature, the conflict, and the resolution. Maintain the ABAB rhyme scheme and meter.\n\nCheck if any lines are copied from the original. Avoid phrases like \"Jabberwock\" or \"frabjous\". Ensure the new creature and settings are original. Use alliteration and assonance to mimic the musicality.\n\nLet me draft lines. First stanza sets the scene and warns of the creature. Second introduces the underpass environment. Third the sounds and echoes. Fourth the creature's appearance. Fifth the action and confrontation. Sixth the echo's effect. Seventh the outcome.\n\nPotential lines:\n\nBeware the Glintzenwurm, my son!\nThe frumious flumplenax is spun\nWhen dusk's last snickerwhin expires,\nAnd glibblejaws chew shadow fires.\n\nHeed the underpass's hollow hum,\nWhere ululation, stark, unbent,\nThrough glimmerflux its vigils plumb—\nA murmurwraith, the echo's bent.\n\nTake the vorpal pen—don't tarry—\nCharge the dusktube, void of light,\nWhere the Glintzenwurm's pricklewings\nTremble with each footfall's plight.\n\nPlunge through static, shrill and sour,\nWhile the echoflux, all aglow,\nSplays its glintzenclaws and roars,\n çiftli izdivaçlı breath to know.\n\n\"Beware its maw of wrawling sound!\"\nCried the frazelibs, shrill and thin,\nAs the worm's backwax roar unwound,\nLooping fricatives within.\n\nBut when the pen's sharp verse did stab,\nThe echo's fuse began to fray,\nAnd the Glintzenwurm, half-sound, half-shab,\nFizzled out in glimmergray.\n\nCheck the meter: each line should be 8 syllables, iambic tetrameter. Some lines might need adjustment. For example, \"Where dusk's last snickerwhin expires\" – \"snickerwhin\" is 4 syllables? Maybe \"snickerwhin\" is 3 (sni-cker-whin). Hmm, maybe rephrase. Also, ensure the invented words fit the rhythm.\n\nUse the creature's name consistently. The conflict involves the pen (a nod to the vorpal blade), using writing as a weapon against the echo creature.

Let me recall what makes Jabberwocky unique. It's got made-up words, a playful rhythm, and a ballad structure. So I need to invent some nonsense words that evoke the misty atmosphere.\n\nFirst, the title. Maybe something like \"The Fogwrixle's Frumious Fume\"? Frumious is from the original poem, so that's a nod to Carroll. Fogwrixle sounds fog-related and whimsical.\n\nStart with an admonition, like warning the reader to beware. \"Beware the Fogwrixle's frumious fume,\" sets the tone. Then describe the morning scene with some invented verbs. \"Mimsy morn\" keeps the Jabberwocky feel. Maybe \"the mistyclaws creep\" – mistyclaws could be claws of mist.\n\nNext, the preparation. The protagonist takes a vorpal lens, which is a playful twist on the vorpal blade. \"Snicker-snack\" is a direct reference. The journey through the fog needs some obstacles: \"th’ulogrif’s tooth\" and \"jubjub’s squall\". Uogrif and Jubjub are Carroll-esque creatures.\n\nThen the encounter with the Fogwrixle. Use alliteration and action: \"Fogwrixle’s wizzle whimpered, whiffling away\". Celebratory return with \"galumphing\" and \"brillig sun\". Finally, a toast to the adventure with \"flumplenax\" and \"splendiferous brew\".\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme. Quatrains with ABAB rhyme. Playful cadence with anapestic tetrameter where possible. Make sure the invented words fit the rhythm. Words like \"frumious\", \"thwick\", \"gloriumpting\" should flow naturally.\n\nLet me piece it together. Start with the warning, the journey, the battle (though not too intense), the victory, and the celebration. Keep it light and whimsical, maintaining the ballad style. Ensure the admonition and celebratory return are clear. Test the rhythm by reading aloud. Adjust any clunky parts. Make sure the fog is personified with fantastical elements.

Next, the creature. Carroll used the Jabberwock, so I need a unique name. Maybe \"Mnemoslith\" combining \"mnemo\" (memory) and \"slith\" from Carroll's slithy tothers.\n\nFor the style, lots of alliteration and neologisms.

Then the preparation, maybe carrying a \"thistle-spark\" for luck. The path itself is \"snicker-snack\", with obstacles like \"wockets\" and \"slurms\". The celebratory return should highlight the triumph of the desire path over formal routes.\n\nNeed to maintain the playful tone and ensure the invented words fit naturally.

Maybe something like \"The Cartowhack\" combining \"cartography\" and a whimsical suffix. Next, the structure should mirror \"Jabberwocky\" with quatrains and a consistent meter, probably iambic tetrameter.\n\nThe poem should tell a story of encountering a fantastical creature related to maps. The original has the Jabberwock, so here, a creature like the \"Mappalog\" could work. It should have features that metaphorically relate to maps—maybe tentacles like lines, shifting forms for changing territories.\n\nInvented coinages are essential. Words like \"frumious\" from the original can be echoed with terms such as \"snicker-snacks\" (but avoid direct copies). So, creating verbs like \"squibble\" (to draw hastily), \"jinkle\" (to make a sound?), \"glibble\" (to speak nonsense). Maybe \"vorpal\" could be reimagined as \"glorp\" for a blade.\n\nThe narrative should involve a journey with the map, facing the creature. Include actions like whiffing, slashing, outjinking, and emerging victorious. The map's power to navigate and the danger of getting lost in its intricacies. Ending with a moral about braving the unknown, as in the original.\n\nCheck for adherence to the style: playful language, alliteration, nonsense words that still convey meaning through sound. Ensure no lines are copied, only the structure and whimsical feel. Test the meter to maintain the rhythm. Finally, review for a named creature and invented terms as requested.\n</think>\n\n**The Cartowhack**  \n\n‘Twas mimsy on the meridian, where the parallels play,  \nA frothy mappalog slithered—Beware the Glintblay!  \nWith squibblejaws of longitude, and tentacles of date,  \nIt glibblemaps the wanderlost in its vorpal debate.  \n\n\"He chortled in the azimuth!\" the nervy voyeurs cried,  \nAs I brandished my glorpblade (new-snickered, side by side).  \n\"Plunge through the Nullarbor’s maw, then jink beyond the bend—  \nA frumious chart’s afoot, and the compasses contend!\"  \n\nLong time the manxome mappalog my moorings did fray,  \nTill—*whumplatonk*—I outsquibbed its fractal, shifting sway.  \nI burbled \"North’s a mirage!\" and tunneled through its prime,  \nThen lathed the zenith’s stardust in quadrants of old thyme.  \n\nOh, the mome raths may quabble of wayposts left forlorn,  \nBut I’ll jamble every strait where no glyphers have sworn.  \n‘Tis blather, bluster, and glee—toout the Cartowhack’s guile…  \nFor the vallest who whiffles last owns the glimmer and the mile.**", "info": {"topic": "map"}, "reward": 0.8888888888888888, "label": "high", "criteria_yes": 16, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.8888888888888888, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "model_id": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "model_slug": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1"}

So first, I need to invent some whimsical words that evoke a sense of place and adventure. Words like \"slumberjays\" or \"glibbleglow\" might work.\n\nThe poem should have a title that sounds adventurous, maybe \"O'er Layover's Wavy Shore\". Then, the first stanza needs to set the scene, inviting the reader to the bay. Mentioning the \"frumious-INFUSED\" tide adds that Carroll-esque flair. Next, an admonition or preparation: warn about the \"mome shiverwings\" and \"glthumbs\" to create a sense of caution. \n\nThe second stanza introduces the journey, using \"gallivant\" to convey playful travel. Invented creatures like \"snicker-Snarks\" and \"flibuljibits\" will add to the whimsy. The third stanza should escalate the challenge, perhaps with a \"Beware the Glumb\" and a \"Floop's dark tide\". \n\nThen, a celebratory return with spoils like \"shimmerjell\" and \"jinkleplacks\". Ending with a toast to the bay, using alliteration like \"fizzle and foam\" to maintain the playful tone. Need to check the rhyme scheme and cadence to match the original's ballad feel.

The original has a lot of invented terms like \"slithy,\" \"mome,\" \"galumphing,\" and the famous \"jabberwock\" itself. So, I need to capture that essence but with the theme of screen burn-in.\n\nAlright, screen burn-in. That's when images get stuck on a screen from being displayed too long. So, I need to personify that somehow. Maybe create a creature that causes this problem. The user mentioned including a named creature, so I should come up with a name. Maybe something like \"Burnwry\" or \"Pixelwraith\"? Let me brainstorm a bit.\n\nInvented coinages are important here. Carroll uses compound words and blends. Maybe terms like \"glowstains,\" \"pixelmire,\" \"glitchfire,\" \"flickersnare.\" The poem should have a rhythm similar to \"Jabberwocky,\" which is mainly in trochaic tetrameter. Let me check the meter. Each line has four stressed syllables. So, I need to keep that structure.\n\nThe title should be catchy and reference the theme. \"The Burnwry's Blight\" maybe? Something alliterative. Alright, start drafting the first stanza. Introduce the creature and the setting. \"Beware the Burnwry, my son! / The pixels snicker, the screen is undone.\" Then describe the creature's features and the danger it poses.\n\nNext stanzas should build the adventure—arming oneself with tools (maybe a \"microfiber blade\" to clean the screen), the battle with the Burnwry, and the aftermath. Include some made-up verbs and nouns. Use alliteration and assonance to keep the musicality.\n\nNeed to avoid copying lines from \"Jabberwocky\" but echo the structure.

The title should be catchy, maybe something like \"The Creep's Slithy Stroll.\" \"Slithy\" is a portmanteau from the original, so that fits. Next, invent some creatures and coinages. The original has the Jabberwock, so maybe a \"Slinklepox\" or \"Mumbler\" for the antagonist.\n\nThe poem should tell a brief story: a creature causing trouble, someone confronting it. Use alliteration and invented verbs. Words like \"glibble\" for speaking nonsense, \"wuggle\" for movement. Ensure each stanza flows with the same rhythm as the original, maintaining the AABB rhyme scheme.\n\nCheck for any copied lines. Instead of \"Beware the Jabberwock,\" maybe \"Beware the Slinklepox.\" Include a named creature, perhaps \"the Mumbler\" as the foe. Add some eerie imagery with \"moon's pale glimmer\" and \"shadows clamber.\" End with the protagonist defeating the creep, using a vorpal-like blade, but rename it to something like \"glintzen\" blade.\n\nEnsure the poem has a narrative arc: warning, encounter, battle, victory.

The Flarion could be a serpent-like creature made of electricity. Maybe \"snick\" as a verb for the creature's movement.\n\nSecond stanza: Describe the setting, maybe a station at night. \"Moon's milky leer\" gives a eerie feel. \"Glintzen\" for the rails shining. The hum awakens the Flarion. Use words like \"frazzlepox\" to describe the electric charge in the air.\n\nThird stanza: Action, the creature moves. \"Snick\" through the tracks, \"flickerwings\" for its electric presence.

The outcome is the hum subsiding, dawn breaks. \"Jim-jam\" as a nonsense word for the fading sound.\n\nEnding: Return to calm, the city's pulse. \"Third Rail Thrums\" still lurking, a reminder of the hidden dangers.

So I need to mimic that style but focus on a science fair theme.\n\nFirst, I need a title that sounds whimsical and alliterative, maybe something like \"The Science Faire's Frabjulicious Quest\". Frabjulicious is a reference to Carroll's \"frabjous\". \n\nThe poem should have a narrative structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has a hero who goes on a quest, faces challenges, and returns triumphant. Translating that to a science fair, the student (the hero) prepares their project, faces obstacles (like experiments going wrong), and then presents successfully, celebrating afterward.\n\nNext, invent some nonsense words related to science. Words like \"flumplenax\" for a complicated process, \"grooblins\" for minor issues, \"snickelfritz\" for something lively, \"whiffling\" for whimsical, \"jinkleplack\" for a device. These should blend into the verses seamlessly.\n\nMaintain the ballad rhythm, which is typically iambic tetrameter with an ABAB rhyme scheme. Each stanza should have four lines, with the second and fourth lines rhyming. Let me test the meter as I draft each line.\n\nInclude an admonition, a warning to the participant. Maybe caution about the challenges they'll face, like \"Beware the Flarpblatt’s mimsy might\". Then the preparation phase, gathering materials and setting up. The journey to the science fair, facing technical difficulties (\"the pixels frabbed in disarray\") but overcoming them. Finally, the triumphant return with a celebration, using alliteration and playful language.\n\nCheck for playful cadence and ensure the invented words don't disrupt the flow. Read the poem aloud to test the rhythm. Make sure each stanza transitions smoothly from preparation to challenge to triumph.\n\nNeed a celebratory ending, maybe with confetti made from \"glibbleglorp\" and \"whumplen\" cheers. Emphasize the joy of discovery and the successful project. Keep the tone light and encouraging, honoring both the effort and the fun of the science fair experience.\n\nAlright, putting it all together now, adhering to the structure and style, ensuring the invented words fit naturally, and the rhyme scheme is consistent. Let me review each stanza for meter and rhyme, tweaking as necessary to match the ballad feel of the original \"Jabberwocky\".\n</think>\n\n**The Science Faire’s Frabjulicious Quest**  \n\n’Twas glimmernoon, and all the geeks did say,  \n“Beware the *Flarpblatt*’s mimsy might!  \nThe *flumplenax* that vex your disarray  \nAnd *grooblins* gnawing wires bright!”  \n\nShe took the *snickelfritz* in hand, her beaker- helm,  \nAnd *thistlethorps* in test tubes spun,  \nO’er Bunsen-burners (*burble*-blue they’d dwindle-whelm)  \nShe vowed, “I’ll *florp* the *glintzen*—or be undone!”  \n\nLong time the *quizzle* hummed with *jinkleplack* device,  \nAs *sploofs* of data flickered, dropped—  \n“Beware the Fair’s *mome* judges, sharp with *yowch* and spite!”  \nShe *glibble*d, “Pish!

{"i": 18, "prompt": "Write a poem about film camera in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem. Use a few invented coinages and a named creature. Avoid copying lines from the original.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this request. The user wants a poem about a film camera in the style of \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll. They want a title, some invented coinages, a named creature, and no copied lines from the original. Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" It's known for its nonsense words, playful language, and whimsical imagery. The structure is consistent, with each stanza having four lines, often with a rhyme scheme of ABAB. The poem also features made-up creatures, like the Jabberwock itself, and verbs that sound meaningful but aren't real, like \"galumphing\" or \"frumious.\"\n\nSo, the task is to emulate that style but focus on a film camera. Let's brainstorm some elements related to film cameras. There's the physical aspects: shutter, lens, film reel, darkroom, developing the film. Then, the process: loading the film, snapping photos, waiting to develop, the anticipation of seeing the results. Maybe personify parts of the camera or the process as creatures or actions.\n\nNow, the invented coinages. I need to create some words that sound like they fit the nonsense style. For example, \"shutterwings\" could combine shutter and wings, giving the camera a sense of movement or flight. \"Frosthaze\" might describe the blur or a effect in the film. Maybe \"glintwings\" for the lens reflections.\n\nA named creature is required. In the original, there's the Jabberwock, Bandersnatch, etc. Let's create a creature related to photography. Maybe \"Snappernaught\" – something that snaps pictures, perhaps a playful beast that the photographer must outwit. \"Fimbulfly\" could be a term for the developed images or the act of developing.\n\nStructure-wise, start with a warning, like \"Beware the Snappernaught,\" setting up the central challenge. Then describe the camera's parts and the process of taking a photo. Include some nonsense actions, like \"whirled the focuser's wheel\" or \"danced the glintwings,\" to mimic the original's playful verbs.\n\nNeed to ensure the rhyming scheme is ABAB. Let's draft a line: \"Beware the Shutterwack, my son!\" That introduces a creature and a warning. Then, \"The jaws that bite, the lens that's spun.\" Jaws that bite might refer to the camera's shutter or the lens capturing the image. Spun could relate to the film reel spinning.\n\nFor the creature's name, \"Shutterwack\" combines shutter and whack, implying a sudden movement. Then the process of taking a photo: \"With vorpal film he took the shot, / And waited through the darksome while,\" Vorpal is from the original, but here applied to film. Darksome while refers to the developing time in the darkroom.\n\nThe next stanza could involve the development process: \"He mixed the brew of dev-elotion, / And held his breath for the fix's might.\" Dev-elotion sounds like developer solution. Fix's might refers to the fixer in the developing process.\n\nThen, the emergence of the photo: \"Then, 'midst the hypo's mystic sway, / The Fimbulfly began to gleam— / A snapshot of the frabjulight.\" Hypo is short for sodium thiosulfate, used in fixing. Frabjulight is a nonsense word combining \"frabjous\" (from Jabberwocky) and light, suggesting a wonderful image.\n\nThe creature returns: \"The Snappernaught, with frosthaze wings, / Pursued him down the nega-trail,\" Frosthaze gives a blurred or icy effect. Nega-trail refers to the negative film path.\n\nThe climax of defeating the creature: \"And, as he clicked the final reel, / The Wack collapsed in Kodachrome's zeal!\" Kodachrome is a reference to the film stock, adding a real-world term for authenticity.\n\nFinally, the result: \"So now in albums, safe from blight, / His frumious pixels play all night— / The Shutterwack's victorious spite!\" Frumious combines \"fuming\" and \"mimsy,\" from the original, and \"pixels\" blend old and new photography terms, showing the enduring image.\n\nI need to check for invented words and ensure the creature is named and integrated. Each stanza should flow with the adventure of capturing the image, facing the creature (perhaps the challenges of photography), and the triumph of developing the photo. Avoid direct lines from Jabberwocky but mirror the structure and whimsy.\n</think>\n\n**\"The Shutterwack's Frumious Sway\"**  \n\nBeware the Shutterwack, my son!  \nThe jaws that bite, the lens that’s spun,  \nThe frosthaze claws that blur the sun—  \nAnd shun the Fimbulfly’s stun!  \n\nHe snatched the Snappernaught by statewide,  \nWhere glintwings raged in noon’s disguise,  \nAnd all the whirly 유레icans chide, \"Flee! The aperture devours the skies!\"  \n\nThe fraxle booths, they gyre and gleam,  \nBut wait the shutter’s velvet paw,  \nFor when the timer’s maw snags a dream,  \nIt births a slide too raw to draw.  \n\nWith vorpal film he took the shot,  \nAnd waited through the darksome while,  \nThe nega-trails the Wack had plot—  \nThey coiled in hypo’s brittle smile.  \n\nBut lo! The safelight’s amber waltz  \nUnmade the Wack’s chromatic snare;  \n\"Drink deep,\" it hissed, \"the dev-elotion’s faults!\"  \nBut he uncapped the fixer’s glare.  \n\nThen, 'midst the hypo’s mystic sway,  \nThe Fimbulfly began to gleam—  \nA snapshot of the frabjulight, where gray  \nNow writhed through Kodachrome’s esteem!  \n\nThe Snappernaught, with frosthaze wings,  \nPursued him down the nega-trail,  \nYet every click outleaped its stings—  \nThe Wack collapsed in Kodachrome’s zeal!  \n\nSo now in albums, safe from blight,  \nHis frumious pixels play all night—  \nThe Shutterwack’s victorious spite!", "info": {"topic": "film camera"}, "reward": 0.5, "label": "low", "criteria_yes": 9, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.5, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 0.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 1.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "model_id": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "model_slug": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1"}

Add an admonition or preparation and a celebratory return. Use some invented words.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about a printer jam in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" Let me recall that Lewis Carroll's original has a playful, nonsensical language with made-up words, a clear structure, and a ballad rhythm.\n\nFirst, I need to invent some words related to printers and jams. Words like \"glitchmaw\" or \"inkwraith\" could work. The title should be catchy and alliterative, maybe \"The Frabjul Printer’s Plight.\"\n\nThe structure should follow the original's quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. The first stanza introduces the problem. Then, there's a warning or preparation section, like advising to \"Beware the Glitchmaw.\" The middle part describes the battle with the jam, using vivid, fantastical imagery. Finally, a resolution where the printer is fixed, leading to a celebratory return, maybe with some whimsical elements like dancing pixels.\n\nI need to ensure the cadence is playful and rhythmic, with some invented verbs and nouns. Words like \"burble\" and \"flumplenax\" add that Carroll-esque touch. Also, including a moral or advice, such as \"Beware the Glitchmaw\" repeated for emphasis.\n\nLet me check each stanza for rhyme and meter. The first line sets the scene, then the warning. The action builds up with the jam's chaos, the struggle to fix it, and the eventual triumph. Ending with a return to normalcy but with a whimsical twist, like glowing prints and giggling keys, maintains the playful tone.\n\nInvented words need to fit naturally, maybe \"flarp\" and \"jinklewiff\" for parts of the printer.

Avoid copying lines from the original.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about an umbrella in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Let me recall what makes 'Jabberwocky' unique. Carroll uses nonsense words, playful language, and a whimsical, adventurous tone. The poem has a rhythm and structure that's reminiscent of epic tales, with made-up creatures and verbs.\n\nFirst, the title needs to be catchy and a bit nonsensical, maybe alluding to a fantastical quest involving an umbrella. \"The Frumplenax of Fizzlethorn Peak\" sounds good—it has that Carroll-esque ring with \"Frumplenax\" as a creature and \"Fizzlethorn\" as a place.\n\nNow, the poem should tell a story. The protagonist faces a creature, the Frumplenax, and uses the umbrella as a weapon. I need to invent some coinages. Words like \"splatwix\" (a mix of splat and mix?), \"blimblam\" (something sparkly or noisy?), \"flibloom\" (maybe something that blooms or moves?), \"shredgale\" (a harsh wind?), and \"glintzen\" (something shiny or protective?).\n\nInclude a named creature, the Frumplenax. Describe its features: burblejaws, sloshing maw, eyes like puddlewert. The umbrella transforms into a glintzen blade. The battle scene should have vivid, whimsical action. End with the umbrella remaining, a symbol of whimsy.\n\nStructure-wise, follow a similar stanza pattern to Jabberwocky—four-line stanzas with an ABCB rhyme scheme. Use alliteration and playful verbs. Avoid copying any original lines but mimic the style. Check that the made-up words fit the rhythm and contribute to the imagery.

Each stanza four lines with an ABCB rhyme scheme. Let me check each line's syllable count to maintain the flow.\n\nIncluding a named creature, maybe \"the Beastrail Slink\" as an obstacle. It needs to be fantastical. The Maphound uses the map to navigate through challenges like \"squelching pools of glimmerglorp\" and avoiding the Beastrail Slink.\n\nAdding some vivid imagery related to maps: ink rivers, parchment plains, compasses.

The challenge is capturing that whimsy while describing a music room.\n\nFirst, the title. It should be catchy and a bit nonsensical. Maybe something like \"The Mimsywaild Frabjulax\" – \"Mimsywaild\" sounds musical and \"Frabjulax\" is a nod to Carroll's style. \n\nNow, the setting. The music room needs fantastical elements. Perhaps creatures made of musical instruments or items. A \"Quillensnorp\" could be a squirrel-like creature playing a flute. \"Frolichord\" might be a harp that moves on its own. \n\nI should create some coinages: verbs like \"warblooming\" (a mix of warble and blooming) and \"splinkling\" (a combination of splink and twinkling).

The admonition could be a warning to not get lost in the feeling, while the celebratory part rejoices in the experience.

Each stanza should build the atmosphere. Use alliteration and playful language. Include actions like \"tiptoe through shimmer and shade\" to show movement and stealth. \n\nI should introduce the creature with some menacing yet whimsical traits. \"Jaws agape, full of gleam\" and \"Eyes aglow, like lanternflies\" add to the fantasy.

Maybe something like \"The Brew of Buttermere\"? \"Buttermere\" sounds mystical and relates to butter, and \"Brew\" gives that magical cooking aspect.\n\nNow, the structure. The original has quatrains with alternating rhymes. I should follow that. Also, there's an adventure or quest element, facing some challenge, and a triumphant return. For brown butter, maybe the challenge is cooking it without burning, and the triumph is the flavor achieved.\n\nInvented words are crucial here. Words like \"galumphing\" in the original. Let's think of terms related to cooking brown butter. \"Frothwings\" for the foam that appears, \"sputniks\" for the crackling sounds, \"caramelux\" to describe the caramelized flavor. \"Fizzlethorn\" could be a warning about burning.\n\nThe poem needs a beginning that warns or prepares the reader, a middle that describes the process and adventure, and an end that celebrates the success. Start with an admonition, like \"Beware the Fizzlethorn,\" to mimic \"Beware the Jabberwock.\"\n\nInclude playful instructions: \"Take thou the golden slab, / Melt it in skillet’s grab.\" Then build up the process, the transformation from regular butter to brown. Use alliteration and onomatopoeia: \"sizzle\", \"swirl\", \"sputter\", \"crackle\".\n\nEnd with the reward—pouring it on food, the celebration. Maybe a stanza about the taste and the joy it brings. Something like \"Pour it o’er pancakes high, / Let the feasting crowd cry—‘My! / What a brew of Buttermere / Makes the tastebuds dance and peer!’\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme and rhythm. Each stanza should have four lines, with ABAB or AABB rhymes. Let me test each stanza's flow. For example:\n\n\"Whiffling flames, a twinklebright, \nNow the frothwings take their flight—\nCarmelux seeps, a serpentine,\nStir not yet, nor thou decline,\"\n\n\"Whiffling\" for dancing flames, \"twinklebright\" for the shimmer. \"Frothwings\" as the foam rising. \"Carmelux\" as the caramel essence. Then the caution not to stir too soon.\n\nI should also ensure that invented words are consistent and fit the context. Maybe \"sizzleplack\" for the skillet, \"sputniks\" for the popping sounds. \"Glibbleglorp\" as the noise when it's almost done.\n\nFinally, the celebratory return: the successful brown butter, the feast, and the joy. The last stanza should feel triumphant, maybe with a toast to Buttermere.\n\nLet me assemble all these elements, check the meter and rhyme, and make sure it flows like a playful ballad with that Jabberwocky flair.\n</think**\n\n**The Brew of Buttermere**  \n\n\"Beware the Fizzlethorn, my son!  \nThe sizzleplack’s hot, the deed’s undone—  \nProof the spoon, the swirl, the pan,  \nOr burnt to bits, thy dish’ll scan!\"  \n\nHe took the slab of golden-creme,  \nHefted high with frothwings’ theme.  \n\"Galumph right, with twirly whisk!  \nBurn not, lest the chefs all hisse!\"  \n\nHe sputtered near the flame’s hot rim,  \nCarmelux seeped, a serpentine whim.  \n\"O frabjulose!

I should follow that. Let's start setting the scene, maybe a whimsical landscape. The original uses \"twilight\" and \"borogoves.\" I'll need a setting where interference occurs, perhaps a digital or signal-related conflict.\n\nInvented coinages: maybe \"glitcheon\" for a glitch-related creature, \"flarewyrm\" combining flare and wyrm for something fiery. \"Spectravores\" could be beings that consume spectra or signals. \"Pulsarats\" might be rodents disrupting pulses or signals.\n\nThe creature needs a name. The original has the Jabberwock. Let's use \"Frivlopi\" as the main antagonist, perhaps causing interference. Maybe it's a mischievous creature that disrupts things, like signals or communications.\n\nThe poem should have a narrative arc: a warning, the creature's actions, a confrontation, and resolution. Use nonsense verbs and adjectives. Words like \"splink,\" \"flumplenux,\" \"glibble\" can add to the whimsy.\n\nNeed to ensure originality, not copying lines. Focus on the theme of interference—maybe technological interference, but in a fantastical setting. Use terms related to signals, waves, static.\n\nCheck rhyme scheme. Each stanza ends with a couplet. Let me draft the first stanza:\n\nIn the valley of Vibe where the glitcheons play,\nA Frivlopi meddled at end of the day,\nWith a flick of its fringe and a splink of its toe,\nIt tangled the waves in a fractal foe.\n\nThat introduces the creature and the problem. Next stanza could describe the interference effects:\n\nIt frolicked through frequencies, high and low band,\nLeft the pulsarats chattering, lost in the sand,\nThe spectravores howled at the dissonant blight,\nAs the fiberopt wyrms sparked with fury and light.\n\nNow show the confrontation. Maybe a hero intervenes:\n\n\"Shoo!\" the brave Flarp cried with a flap of his ears,\n\"Your jamming's most vexing, it brings us to tears!\"\nBut the Frivlopi glibble-jawed, wry, quite unbowed,\nUnspooled a fresh static to muddle the cloud.\n\nEnd with the resolution, perhaps the Frivlopi is tamed or the problem resolved:\n\nSo they danced the flibber-flam, spun a helix of code,\nAnd the Frivlopi, bemused, let the signals bestow\nTheir clarity keen, through the ether so bright—\nTill its next whimsy called through the wireless night.\n\nCheck for invented words, rhyme scheme, and structure. Ensure it's distinct from the original but captures the essence. The title is included, and lines aren't copied. Looks good.\n</think>\n\n**The Frivlopi Fiasco**  \n\nIn the valley of Vibe where the glitcheons play,  \nA Frivlopi meddled at end of the day,  \nWith a flick of its fringe and a splink of its toe,  \nIt tangled the waves in a fractal foe.  \n\nIt frolicked through frequencies, high and low band,  \nLeft the pulsarats chattering, lost in the sand,  \nThe spectravores howled at the dissonant blight,  \nAs the fiberopt wyrms sparked with fury and light.  \n\n“Shoo!” the brave Flarp cried with a flap of his ears,  \n“Your jamming’s most vexing, it brings us to tears!”  \nBut the Frivlopi glibble-jawed, wry, quite unbowed,  \nUnspooled a fresh static to muddle the cloud.  \n\nSo they danced the flibber-flam, spun a helix of code,  \nAnd the Frivlopi, bemused, let the signals bestow  \nTheir clarity keen, through the ether so bright—  \nTill its next whimsy called through the wireless night.", "info": {"topic": "interference"}, "reward": 0.6666666666666666, "label": "medium", "criteria_yes": 12, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.6666666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 0.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "model_id": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "model_slug": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1"}

Jabberwocky has quatrains with ABAB rhyme scheme. Let's follow that. Start with an introduction to the setting, maybe a warning. \"Beware the Creep, and shun the snick / My somber friends, and hold it tight\" – \"snick\" is a made-up word, and the rhyme works.\n\nNext, describe the Creep's features. Use alliteration and invented terms. \"Eyes like gloam in glibble night / With lizard lips and hickory feet\" – \"glibble\" and \"hickory\" add that Carroll feel.\n\nInclude an admonition, telling the reader to be cautious. \"Beware the jag-tooth maw he’ll bare / When wuggle suns in wane do splay\" – \"jag-tooth\" and \"wuggle\" are nonsense, fitting the style.\n\nBuild up the confrontation. Maybe the protagonist confronts the Creep with a weapon. \"And lo, with collaborative shout, / I brandished forth a jim-jam blade\" – \"jim-jam\" is playful, and \"collaborative\" adds a twist.\n\nThe resolution: defeating the Creep, leading to celebration. \"The beast let out a gurgle-screech, / Then crumpled, lost in luncheon shade\" – \"gurgle-screech\" and \"luncheon shade\" are whimsical.\n\nEnd with a return to safety and rejoicing. \"Now, jubilant, I mosey home, / With faddle pride and frabjous cheer!\" – \"faddle\" and \"frabjous\" (from Carroll) celebrate the victory.\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme and rhythm. Each stanza has four lines, ABAB, with a playful bounce. Ensure invented words blend naturally without disrupting the flow.\n\nMake sure the poem includes the requested elements: title, playful ballad cadence, invented words, admonition, and a celebratory return.

It's filled with nonsense words that sound meaningful, playful language, and a whimsical, adventurous tone. The challenge is to mimic that style while incorporating the theme of an awl.\n\nFirst, I need to come up with a title that echoes the whimsy. \"The Awl and the Snicker-Snack\" seems fitting, referencing the Vorpal Blade from the original. Next, I should invent some creatures and coinages. Maybe a creature like the \"Burble\" or \"Flish\" to add that fantastical element. \n\nInventing verbs and nouns: \"gallimaufry\" could describe a chaotic scene. \"Flish\" might be a creature that the awl interacts with. \"Snicker-snack\" can be used, but the user said to avoid copying lines, so maybe adapt it to \"snicker-whack.\" \n\nStructure-wise, quatrains with a consistent rhyme scheme, probably ABAB. The awl needs to be personified as a brave tool on a quest. Including some alliteration and internal rhymes will enhance the \"Jabberwocky\" feel. \n\nCheck for any lines that might be too similar to the original. Focus on the awl's journey through a fantastical world, overcoming obstacles with its sharp point. Use invented words sparingly but effectively to maintain authenticity. \n\nLet me draft a stanza and see. Maybe start with \"Beware the Burble's stingwings...\" Introduce the Flish as a foe.

The user wants a poem about Layover Bay in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" First, I need to recall what \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll is like. It's known for its nonsense words, playful language, and a rhythmic ballad structure. So, the poem should have a similar cadence, made-up words, and a narrative that includes an admonition or preparation and a celebratory return.\n\nStarting with the title. \"Jabberwocky\" has a whimsical, alliterative title. Maybe \"The Layover's Lilt of Layover Bay\" to capture that essence. Next, the structure. The original has quatrains with an ABCB rhyme scheme. I'll follow that.\n\nFirst stanza needs to set the scene. Introduce Layover Bay with some fantastical elements. Maybe mention a mythical creature or unique feature. Use invented words here. \"Flumplenooks\" could be the creatures, and \"snicklefritz\" as a type of wind. That adds the nonsense touch.\n\nSecond stanza: the admonition. The original warns about the Jabberwock. Here, the warning could be about the \"Momegapox\" or \"Flibberjibits.\" Maybe the traveler is advised to prepare, like packing \"mimsy morsels\" and a \"jambleorient sunhat.\" These invented terms fit the style.\n\nThird stanza: preparing for the journey. Mentioning the gear and the mindset. \"Gallimaufry boots\" and \"thrillicum spur\" add to the whimsy. Including a \"flapjacket\" and \"sonnets unsung\" keeps the playful tone.\n\nFourth stanza: arrival at Layover Bay. Describe the scenery with \"jubjub blooms\" and \"slithy sands.\" The \"frabjous feast\" references the original's \"frabjous\" and suggests celebration.\n\nFifth stanza: the challenge faced, maybe the \"Mindlespate\" tide. Use action words like \"gyre\" and \"wamble,\" showing movement and struggle. Ending with triumph, \"victuals\" and \"mythic mead\" to celebrate.\n\nFinal stanza: the return home, decorated with \"lumplifier medals\" and sharing tales. Emphasize the transformation from the experience. Ending with a playful repeat of the bay's name, tying it back to the title.\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme and meter.

Hmm, \"Wanderslacks\" sounds better. Now, the style requires coinages. Let me think of some verbs or nouns that mimic Carroll's style. Words like \"galumphing\" or \"frumious\" from the original. Maybe \"snicker-snacked\" or \"thwickled\".\n\nNext, a named creature. In \"Jabberwocky\" there's the Jabberwock, so here I need a creature that embodies the desire path. Maybe the \"Thwumplack\" or \"Wuggle\". Wait, \"Wuggle\" is cute. The Wuggle could be the creature that creates or follows these paths. \n\nThe structure should have a rhythm similar to the original, perhaps quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme.

Avoid copying lines from the original.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about morning fog in the style of 'Jabberwocky' with a title, some invented words, and a named creature. Let me start by recalling what makes 'Jabberwocky' unique—its playful language, nonsense words that still convey meaning, and a rhythmic, almost musical flow. The original has a narrative too, so maybe I need a simple storyline here.\n\nFirst, the title. 'Jabberwocky' uses a portmanteau, so maybe something like \"The Foggrim's Creep\" or \"Mornmist's Sway\". Let me think... \"The Glibble's Gambol\" sounds catchy and has that whimsical feel.\n\nNow, the setting. Morning fog, so I should describe it in a fantastical way. Use words that evoke mist but are invented. Maybe \"glibble\" as the creature? That could work. The Glibble could be a mystical being that appears with the fog.\n\nInvented coinages: \"flibulloom\" for the fog itself, \"wuggle\" for movement, \"snickerflee\" for something fleeting. Need to make sure they fit the rhythm. Each stanza should have a similar structure to Carroll's, maybe four-line stanzas with an AABB rhyme scheme.\n\nInclude a warning or advice, like in 'Jabberwocky' where the father warns the son. Maybe the protagonist is cautioned about the Glibble's tricks. Then describe the fog's behavior, how it moves and affects the environment. Use alliteration and assonance to keep the musicality.\n\nCheck if the original lines are copied. Avoid phrases like \"slithy toves\" but create similar creatures. The Glibble should have unique traits—maybe gossamer wings, scattering dew, leading travelers astray. End with the fog lifting, dawn breaking, and the creature disappearing.\n\nLet me draft the first stanza:\n\n\"Beware the Glibble’s gauzy guile,\nAs flibulloom shrouds the dawn’s frail smile,\nWith snickerflee and wisps it strays,\nAnd lures the lost in misty ways.\"\n\nNow the creature's actions and the environment's reaction. Next stanza could introduce the Glibble's movement and effects:\n\n\"It wuggles down from hill to dell,\nA vap’rish waltz, a ghostly spell,\nThrough bracken blurred in twilight hue,\nIt herds the night’s last shadows through.\"\n\nAdd a warning or interaction. Maybe the protagonist confronts it but decides to wait:\n\n\"Take heed, young wanderer, of its whistleblow,\nLest in its snare your path bestow\nTo wait till sunfire splits the gray—\nThe Glibble shrinks from light of day.\"\n\nFinally, the resolution with dawn:\n\n\"Then as the morn’s keen blade ascends,\nThe foggrim melts to silver ends,\nEach tendril threads the waking land,\nAnd dewclad peace resumes command.\"\n\nCheck the rhythm, meter, and rhyme. Ensure invented words make sense in context. Avoid any direct lines from 'Jabberwocky'. Looks good. Title is \"The Glibble’s Gambol\".

Let me recall what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It uses nonsense words that sound meaningful, playful language, a ballad rhythm, and rhyming verse. The structure is quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme.\n\nFirst, I need to brainstorm some invented words related to conference room elements. Maybe terms like \"flumplenax\" for a conference table, \"snickelvox\" for presentations, \"glintzen\" for screen glare, \"scribblewights\" for notes. Think of actions and objects in a meeting: presentations, debates, coffee, screens, notes, whiteboards.\n\nThe poem should have a narrative arc, like the original. Start with an admonition or preparation, then the journey into the conference room, challenges faced, and a celebratory return. Let's outline the stanzas:\n\n1. Introduction and warning about the conference room (Beware the...)\n2. Entering the room and initial challenges (mome raths, distractions)\n3. The battle with presentations and discussions (Jabberwock vs. the protagonist)\n4. Victory and return with celebratory tone\n\nMake sure each stanza has four lines with the ABAB rhyme scheme. Include playful, rhythmic language. Use alliteration and invented words to mimic Carroll's style. Check the meter, mostly iambic tetrameter.\n\nPotential first line: \"Beware the Flumplenax, my son!\" referencing the conference table. Then describe the room's elements. Next stanza introduces the \"frumious Bandersnatch\" as a metaphor for a difficult topic. The protagonist takes the \"vorpal pen\" to defeat the Jabberwock (the meeting's challenges). End with a triumphant return, maybe with a \"chortle\" and celebration.\n\nNeed to ensure the invented words fit naturally and the playful cadence is maintained. Read aloud to test rhythm.

Let me start by recalling the features of \"Jabberwocky\"—nonsensical words, playful language, a narrative with a heroic quest, and vivid imagery.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the third rail hum is. It's the sound from the electrified third rail in train tracks. So, the poem should personify this hum, maybe as a mysterious entity. The creature needs a name, like \"Mototh\" or something that sounds mechanical yet mythical.\n\nInvented coinages are necessary. Words like \"glintzen,\" \"vibroth,\" \"ziszlep,\" and \"snickel\" could work. They should have a pseudo-meaning related to the theme. The poem should have a rhythm similar to the original, with a consistent meter and rhyme scheme.\n\nThe structure of \"Jabberwocky\" has stanzas with four lines, often with an ABAB rhyme scheme. I'll follow that. Start with a warning about the third rail creature. Use alliteration and made-up verbs. Include a narrative where someone confronts the creature, maybe using a tool like a \"conductor's bat\" instead of a sword.\n\nMake sure to avoid copying any lines from the original. Check each line for uniqueness. The title should be catchy and alliterative, like \"Third Rail Thrum\" to capture the sound and the theme.\n\nNow, draft each stanza step by step, ensuring the playful language and invented words fit naturally.

So, I need to mimic that style while incorporating the theme of screen burn-in.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the invented words.

Applying that here: start with a warning about burn-in, the quest to face it, the struggle, and the victorious return with advice.\n\nInvented verbs will help, like \"galumphing\" or \"burble.\" The screen's enemies could be \"glitzen\" and \"pixel wights.\" The solution might involve adjusting settings (\"brillig backlight\") and using a screensaver (\"mimsy saver\").\n\nI need to ensure each stanza flows into the next, maintaining the playful cadence.

Maybe something like \"The Echoflux Jinglewraith\"? \"Echoflux\" combines echo and flux, suggesting movement and sound. \"Jinglewraith\" mixes jingle and wraith, implying a ghostly, ringing creature.\n\nThe poem should start with a warning, similar to \"Beware the Jabberwock.\" Maybe \"Beware the Echoflux Jinglewraith...\" Then set the scene in an underpass. Time is dusk, so \"where dusk’s last fizzles fade\" gives that twilight feel with a playful verb.\n\nNext, describe the underpass environment. Use invented words for sounds and sights. \"Groink\" for the echo, \"squelch\" for the walls. Maybe \"gloopernuts\" for something shiny, like wet tiles or debris. The Jinglewraith should have a presence that affects the surroundings. It \"glibs\" and \"snickles\" to create echoes.\n\nIntroduce a creature, maybe \"mimsy mawworms\" avoiding the Jinglewraith. Mimsy is from the original, so that's a nod. The Jinglewraith's laugh echoes, causing a \"sonic sprawl\" that traps sounds. Use alliteration like \"crickety cracks\" and \"vivid vipers\" for the walls.\n\nA confrontation: facing the Jinglewraith, using a \"sonic flail\" as a weapon. The outcome is defeating it with sound, maybe \"outjingling\" the echoes.

The original uses a consistent meter and rhyme scheme, probably AABB. I should stick to that.\n\nInvented coinages: \"glibblejaws\" for strange creatures, \"snickerdrome\" as a place, \"flumplenooks\" for another creature. The main creature causing déjà vu could be the \"Déjà Thief\" or \"Mnemosnatch.\" Maybe \"time-snatch\" as a verb.\n\nInclude a warning from a parent figure, like \"Beware the Déjà Thief\" similar to \"Beware the Jabberwock.\" Describe the sensation of déjà vu with vivid, fantastical imagery.

The user wants a poem in the style of \"Jabberwocky\" about a music room. First, I need to recall what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It's by Lewis Carroll, right?

So, the key elements here are invented words, a ballad structure with rhyme, and that whimsical feel.\n\nThe title needs to be catchy and maybe include a made-up word. \"The Jinglewiff's Jamboree\" sounds like it fits. Now, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. Let's stick to that. \n\nFirst stanza: Setting the scene in the music room. Use some alliteration and invented verbs. \"Whiffling waltzes\" and \"frumious frets\" – \"frumious\" is from the original poem, so that's a good nod. Mention instruments coming alive. \n\nAdmonition or preparation: The second stanza should warn about some dangers. Maybe the \"mome cruncher\" and \"glitchwitch\" – these are nonsense creatures. Advise to be careful with the instruments. \"Snicker-snack\" is another Carroll reference, so using that here works.\n\nThe next stanzas describe the journey through the room. Make up words like \"wuggle\" and \"jinglewiff\". Include a variety of instruments – drums, harps, flutes. Keep the rhythm consistent.\n\nCelebratory return: The final stanza should resolve the journey, bringing the instruments back to life. \"Tweedle-boom\" and \"fiddledee\" add to the playful tone. End with a lively exit, encouraging the reader to return. \n\nCheck the rhyme scheme. Each stanza has four lines with ABAB rhymes. Read it aloud to ensure the cadence matches a ballad. Invented words should blend seamlessly without disrupting the flow. Make sure to include both an admonition (the warning about the creatures) and a celebratory return (the lively ending). \n\nLooks like all elements are covered.

Also, a named creature, like the \"Snapjaws\" or \"Glintbeak\".\n\nThe title should be evocative, maybe alliterative. \"Layover Bay\" could become \"Layover's Lurid Lagoon\" or \"The Lay of Layover Bay\".

Maybe \"The Lay of Layover Bay\" to mirror \"The Jabberwocky\".\n\nStructure-wise, \"Jabberwocky\" has four-line stanzas with an ABAB rhyme scheme. I'll follow that. Each stanza introduces a creature or obstacle. Start with a warning, then the journey through the bay, encountering creatures, and a climax with the main beast.\n\nInvented coinages: \"flibberjibits\" (maybe sea spray?), \"mimsy\" is from the original, so avoid that. \"Gallimaufs\" (messy things), \"glintbeaks\" as a creature.

The original has creatures like the Bandersnatch, so I should invent some, like \"Snicker-Snack\" or \"Burble-Beast\". Wait, \"Snicker-Snack\" is from the original, so I need new ones. How about \"Fizzlethorn\" or \"Jinglewhiff\"?\n\nInvented coinages are necessary. Words like \"galumphing\", \"whiffling\" – but I shouldn't copy. Maybe \"glibblejaws\" or \"flamwrick\"? Let me think of verbs and nouns that sound whimsical but relate to sewing or piercing. \"Stitchle\" for stitches, \"pierce\" but in a fancy way.\n\nThe poem should have a narrative. Maybe the protagonist encounters the awl and battles it or uses it. Let's structure it with a beginning, middle, and end. Start with an warning about the awl, describe its features, the journey to confront it, and the outcome.\n\nRhyme scheme and meter: \"Jabberwocky\" uses ABAB quatrains with trochaic tetrameter. So four-line stanzas, alternating rhymes, eight syllables per line. Need to keep that rhythm.\n\nLet me draft the first stanza. Something like:\n\nBeware the Fizzlethorn, my son,\nWith claws of twitch and eyes of dun,\nIt lurks where fabrics softly lie—\nThe frumious Awl goes stitch by stitch.\n\n\"Fizzlethorn\" as a creature. \"Twitch and dun\" for nonsense adjectives. \"Frumious\" from the original, but modified. Then the awl is stitching, giving it a purpose.\n\nNext, a stanza about the tool's parts: the blade, handle. Maybe:\n\nIts blade of glint and grip of grume,\nIt bores through cloth with wuggle and gloam,\nIt sews up tears where shadows play,\nAnd fashions holes both night and day.\n\n\"Glint and grume\" – \"grume\" sounds like a made-up word. \"Wuggle and gloam\" – \"gloam\" is twilight, but used here as a verb. \"Fashions holes\" shows its function.\n\nThen introduce another creature, like the Burble-Beast, to create a fantastical setting:\n\nIt danced with Burble-Beasts of old,\nThrough loom-lit fields of warp and woof,\nIt out-barbed every Needle bold,\nFraxling the threads they couldn’t rove.\n\n\"Burble-Beasts\" as a creature. \"Warp and woof\" relate to weaving. \"Fraxling\" as a made-up verb, meaning to break or tangle threads.\n\nInclude a warning or advice on how to handle the awl:\n\nTake heed, young tailor, when you near\nA hum of hems, a whispering tear—\nFor all its art in fine deceit,\nThe Awl’s sharp heart will find its beat.\n\n\"Whispering tear\" – maybe a torn fabric. \"Sharp heart\" personifies the awl's point.\n\nEnd with a triumphant use of the awl against a creature:\n\n‘Twas brillig when he seized the tool,\nGalumphed the Jinglewhiff’s cruel rule,\n“Snicker-Snack!”—the seams gave way—\nHe tamed the garms with thread of fray.\n\n\"Brillig\" from the original first line. \"Galumphed\" is used but maybe acceptable. \"Jinglewhiff\" as the antagonist. \"Garths\" maybe a typo, should be \"garms\"? \"Thread of fray\" – frayed thread.\n\nCheck for consistency in rhythm and made-up words. Ensure no lines are copied. Each stanza should flow with the adventure. Title fits, and the creatures are original. Should this meet the user's request? I think so. Let me put it all together and check syllable count and rhymes.\n</think>\n\n**The Frumious Awl**  \n\nBeware the Fizzlethorn, my son,  \nWith claws of *twitch* and eyes of dun,  \nIt lurks where fabrics softly lie—  \nThe frumious Awl goes *stitch by stitch*.  \n\nIts blade of *glint* and grip of *grume*,  \nIt bores through cloth with *wuggle* and *gloam*,  \nIt sews up tears where shadows play,  \nAnd fashions holes both night and day.  \n\nIt danced with *Burble-Beasts* of old,  \nThrough loom-lit fields of warp and woof,  \nIt out-barbed every Needle bold,  \n*Fraxling* the threads they couldn’t rove.  \n\nTake heed, young tailor, when you near  \nA hum of hems, a whispering tear—  \nFor all its art in fine deceit,  \nThe Awl’s sharp heart will find its beat.  \n\n’Twas brillig when he seized the tool,  \nGalumphed the *Jinglewhiff’s* cruel rule,  \n“*Snicker-Snack!*”—the seams gave way—  \nHe tamed the garms with thread of fray.", "info": {"topic": "awl"}, "reward": 0.7777777777777778, "label": "medium", "criteria_yes": 14, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.7777777777777778, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "model_id": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "model_slug": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1"}

Make the warnings rhythmic and rhyming.\n\nInclude a preparation phase: armor like \"jingle-jaws\" and \"wizzlethwart.\" Then the confrontation. The battle should be playful but intense, using verbs like \"whiffling,\" \"galumph,\" \"thwarter.\" End with victory and a celebratory return, mentioning feasting and merriment.\n\nEnsure the rhyme scheme is consistent, AABB or ABAB.

Let me start by recalling the original \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll. It uses nonsense words that sound meaningful and has a rhythmic, storytelling style with a heroic quest.\n\nFirst, the title. \"Jabberwocky\" uses alliteration and made-up words. Maybe something like \"The Desiropath's Dilemma\" or \"Through the Wabble's Wood\". Wait, \"Wamble\" is a real word meaning to walk unsteadily, but maybe that's okay. Let's go with \"The Desiropath's Dilemma\" to incorporate \"desire path\" and alliteration.\n\nNext, the structure. Quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. The original has a consistent meter, probably iambic tetrameter. Need to maintain that rhythm.\n\nNow, the concept of a desire path—a trail created by people's repeated use, often cutting through obstacles. In the poem, this path could be personified or part of a fantasy journey. Maybe a creature guards or embodies the path. Let's invent a creature, like \"Flumplenux\" or \"Snickerwisp\". \"Snickerwisp\" has a whimsical feel, like Carroll's creatures.\n\nInvented coinages: Think of verbs and nouns that mimic the original's style. Words like \"galumphing\", \"frumious\" are from Carroll. Maybe \"slithy\" but I need new ones. \"Wuggle\", \"grooblux\", \"flibberjaws\", \"wobberjock\".\n\nThe poem should tell a story: a traveler encounters the desire path, faces the creature, and overcomes the challenge. Include warnings from the narrator, the creature's description, and the traveler's victory.\n\nStart with a warning: \"Beware the Desiropath, my son!\" Then describe the path's winding ways. Introduce the Snickerwisp, maybe with features like \"eyes agleam with wuggle and woe\". The path shifts and deceives, leading the traveler astray.\n\nInclude a stanza where the traveler uses an item (vorpal blade in original) to confront the creature. Maybe \"a glimmerglass in hand\" to symbolize clarity or determination. The Snickerwisp dissipates, and the path becomes clear.\n\nEnsure each stanza flows with the rhythm. Test the meter by reading aloud. Check for invented words that fit naturally without disrupting the flow.\n\nAvoid copying any lines from \"Jabberwocky\", so no \"jabberwock\" or \"bandersnatch\". Original creature and scenario. Make sure the poem stands alone as a homage without plagiarism.\n\nNow, assemble the lines, adjust rhymes and meter, and ensure the creature and coinages are well-integrated.
