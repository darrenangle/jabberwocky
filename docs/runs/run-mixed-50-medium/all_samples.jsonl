You give a mighty thwack!\nIts frazzly snarls unravel, and cannot then come back.\nIt shrieks a blim-blam bluster, and limps away so fast,\nIts interfering mischief, forever in the past!\n\nThen joy!

{"i": 0, "prompt": "Write a poem about underpass echo in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem. Use a few invented coinages and a named creature. Avoid copying lines from the original.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about underpass echo in the style of \"Jabberwocky\" with a title, some invented coinages, and a named creature. Let me start by recalling the original \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll. It's known for its nonsense words, playful language, and whimsical creatures. So I need to capture that essence but focus on an underpass echo.\n\nFirst, the title should be catchy and have a similar alliteration to \"Jabberwocky.\" Maybe something like \"Underpass Umberwyrm\" to incorporate the setting and a creature name. The creature, Umberwyrm, sounds mysterious and fits the underpass environment.\n\nNow, the structure: \"Jabberwocky\" has a consistent rhyme scheme and meter, mostly quatrains with an AABB pattern. I'll stick to that. The first stanza should introduce the underpass and the time, maybe twilight when echoes are noticeable.\n\nFor the creature, the Umberwyrm, it should inhabit the underpass. Maybe it's made of shadows or sound. I need to invent some actions for it, like \"glibble\" and \"glum\" to describe its movements. The echo itself can be personified as something that \"murmle\" and \"squelch,\" using coinages here.\n\nThe next stanza needs a narrator's warning, similar to \"Beware the Jabberwock.\" Phrases like \"Shun the gloam\" and \"frumious hum\" can create that eerie feeling. The underpass environment should have elements like \"squelch-wumps\" and \"jingle-placks\" to mimic the original's nonsense words.\n\nThen, the encounter with the Umberwyrm. The protagonist might use a \"sonicickle\" as a weapon, which plays on \"icicle\" and \"sonic\" for sound. The battle should be lively with made-up verbs like \"glibble\" and \"jinkle.\" The echo's reaction can involve \"murmle\" and \"thrum,\" emphasizing sound effects.\n\nThe climax where the echo is defeated needs a dramatic line, maybe shattering into \"shiverjaws\" and fading into \"thimble-silence.\" Ending with the protagonist escaping as the underpass returns to normal, but with a lingering hum, wraps it up neatly.\n\nLet me check the coinages: glibble, glum, murmle, squelch-wumps, jingle-placks, frumious, sonicickle, jinkle, shiverjaws, thimble-silence. These should be unique and fit the style. The creature Umberwyrm is named and integral to the plot. I think this meets the user's request without copying any original lines.

Add an admonition or preparation and a celebratory return. Use some invented words.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this request. The user wants a poem about morning fog in the style of \"Jabberwocky\". First, I need to recall what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It's got a playful ballad rhythm, lots of invented words, and a whimsical yet adventurous tone.\n\nSo the title should be catchy and a bit nonsensical, maybe using alliteration. \"The Fog-Born Frumious Floop\" – Frumious is from the original poem, and Floop adds a playful twist. \n\nNow, the structure. Quatrains with an ABCB rhyme scheme, maybe alternating eight and four syllables? Let me check the original. Yeah, Carroll uses that structure. So I'll stick to that.\n\nFirst stanza: set the scene. Morning fog creeping in. Use some invented verbs like \"flibuljibits\" to mimic Carroll's style. Maybe warn the reader to be cautious, as the fog has dangers. \"Beware the mome raths\" reference, but make it fog-related. \n\nSecond stanza: describe the fog's appearance. \"Wizzle whim wham\" sounds like a whimsical term for the fog's movement. Mention hidden creatures, like \"jinklewiffs\" and \"snickADOWs\" – those names should be fantastical. \n\nIntroduce a creature to avoid, like \"glurblooms\" and \"rophic tizz\" – maybe they sting or trick. The protagonist needs to navigate through, perhaps with a \"vorpal blade\" equivalent, but maybe a \"gloopernaught\" as a tool. \n\nThen the fog clears, the danger passes, and there's a triumphant return. Celebrate with a feast, using playful words like \"brumplenooks\" and \"flumplenux\". End with the adventurer home safe, ready to tell tales. \n\nMake sure each stanza flows into the next, maintaining the ballad cadence. Check the meter to ensure it's lively and playful. Use alliteration where possible to enhance the musicality. Finally, ensure the invented words fit naturally and add to the poem's joy and adventure without being too obscure.\n</think>\n\nThe Fog-Born Frumious Floop  \n\nBeware the mome mists that flibuljibit by,  \nBrewed in the snozzle of dawn’s dewy sigh,  \nWhen frothy fizzlethumps dance, wumplen and wide,  \nAnd glims of glazzle gleam, gilded with glee inside.  \n\nTread softly, my dear, through the namby-wam wade,  \nLest wizzlewhim whams wumplenux ’cross your shade,  \nFor jinklewiffs jive in the phlizzlethorn pelt,  \nAnd snickADOWs snicker where snicker-snarks melt.  \n\nOh, the glurblooms!

Avoid copying lines from the original.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about déjà vu in the style of \"Jabberwocky\". Let me start by recalling the original's features. \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll uses nonsense words that sound meaningful, a strong rhythm, and a playful yet mysterious tone. The structure is quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme.\n\nFirst, I need a title that echoes \"Jabberwocky\" but relates to déjà vu. Maybe something like \"Déjàvocky\" to blend the two. Next, coined words. The original has \"slithy\", \"mome\", \"galumphing\". I should invent similar terms. Words like \"flumplenax\" (a creature?), \"snicker-snatch\" (an action?), \"flibulous\" (describing something). \n\nThe poem needs a narrative. \"Jabberwocky\" tells of a battle with a monster. For déjà vu, maybe a journey where the protagonist encounters a creature that embodies the feeling. The \"Mnemonic Wraithe\" could be the named creature, symbolizing recurring memories.\n\nRhyme and meter are crucial. Iambic tetrameter, four beats per line. Let me check syllable counts. Each line should flow smoothly with made-up words fitting the rhythm. \n\nFirst stanza: Introduce the setting and the mission. \"Beware the Mnemonic Wraithe\" mirrors \"Beware the Jabberwock\". The \"flumplenax shadows\" create a mysterious environment. Mentioning \"memory's maze\" ties to déjà vu's theme of familiarity.\n\nSecond stanza: Action with the creature. \"Snicker-snatch\" as a verb, \"glibloom seeds\" as something scattered. The Wraithe's approach with \"frabjulon sighs\" adds to the atmosphere.\n\nThird stanza: Build tension. \"Flibulous\", \"glintzen\" for bubbly light effects. The \"chronous\" loop references time, fitting déjà vu's time distortion.\n\nFourth stanza: Climax with the battle. \"Vuv(settings)\" and \"jinx the déjà's sting\" show overcoming the feeling. The \"mnemon's might\" uses memory to defeat the Wraithe.\n\nFifth stanza: Resolution. \"Waltz through time's repeat\" suggests acceptance. \"Fuzzle\" for fading, leaving the experience behind.\n\nCheck for invented words and consistency. Ensure each stanza follows the rhyme scheme and meter. Avoid direct lines from \"Jabberwocky\" but mimic its style. The creature \"Mnemonic Wraithe\" is central, and terms like \"flumplenax\" fit the nonsense vocabulary.

I'll stick to that. The user mentioned a playful ballad cadence, so keeping the rhythm consistent is key.\n\nI need to include an admonition or preparation.

Something like \"Beware the Snicker-Snack\" but tailored to the desire path theme.\n\nThen a celebratory return. The poem should end on a positive note, celebrating the journey taken. Using words that evoke joy and accomplishment.\n\nInvented words are necessary. Think of terms that sound plausible but aren't real. Maybe \"flumplenooks\" for obstacles, \"fizzlethorns\" for challenges, \"wuggle\" as a verb. These should fit the rhythm and rhyme.\n\nImagery is important. Desire paths are those shortcuts people take, often through grass or dirt, instead of the laid-out paths. Highlighting the contrast between the planned path and the organic, winding desire path.\n\nPlayful language and rhyme. Use alliteration and assonance to keep the poem flowing. Maybe some internal rhymes as well.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nStart with the warning, introduce the desire path, describe the journey with invented obstacles, the act of taking the path, and the triumphant return.\n\nCheck for rhyme scheme and meter. Each line should be roughly iambic tetrameter, similar to the original.\n\nTest lines for flow. Read them aloud to ensure they have the right cadence.\n\nMake sure the admonition is clear but playful, and the celebration feels uplifting.\n\nAvoid being too literal.

He uses nonsense words, playful language, and a rhythmic, lyrical structure. The original has creatures like the Jabberwock, so I need to invent a similar-sounding creature and some coinages.\n\nFirst, the title. Maybe something that sounds grand and absurd, like \"The Vorpal Meeting\" or \"The Frumious Conference.\" \"The Frumious Conference\" has that Carroll-esque ring. \n\nNow, the setting: a conference room. Think about elements like tables, whiteboards, projectors, endless meetings. Need to Jabberwockify these. \"Frumious\" could describe the conference itself, combining \"fuming\" and \"curious.\" \n\nInvented coinages: \"Qwurled\" for the agenda, \"galumph\" as a verb maybe. The creature needs a name, like \"Bandersnatch\" from the original. Maybe \"Snicker-Snitch\" or \"Burble-Beast.\" Let's go with \"Burble-Beast\" to represent the meeting's chaos.\n\nStructure-wise, quatrains with AABB rhyme scheme.

{"i": 5, "prompt": "Write a poem about music room in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem. Keep a playful ballad cadence with some rhyme. Add an admonition or preparation and a celebratory return. Use some invented words.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about a music room in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Let me break this down. First, I need to recall the characteristics of 'Jabberwocky'. It's known for its neologisms, playful language, and whimsical creatures, all while maintaining a ballad rhythm with rhyme scheme and meter.\n\nSo, the title should be catchy and have that nonsense feel. Maybe something like \"The Mimsy Melodeon's Lilt\"? \"Mimsy\" is from the original poem, and \"Melodeon\" is an old-fashioned musical instrument. That fits.\n\nNext, the structure. 'Jabberwocky' has quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme and iambic tetrameter. I'll need to stick to that. The user mentioned an admonition or preparation and a celebratory return. Let me outline the flow: introduce the music room with wonder, warn about the challenges (like the \"Jabberwock\" had dangers), then triumph over them with music.\n\nInvented words are crucial here. Words like \"snicker-snack\" from the original can inspire new terms. Maybe \"flumplenooks\" for obstacles, \"glibblejaws\" for something mischievous, \"gallimaufry\" for a mix of sounds, and \"mellwhen\" as a verb related to music.\n\nFor the admonition, I'll create a sense of danger in the music room. Perhaps personifying musical challenges as beasts. Then, the celebration comes from overcoming them with the power of music.\n\nNeed to ensure playful cadence. Using alliteration and internal rhymes will help, like \"whiffling echoes\" or \"gallant gallimaufry\". The refrain \"mimsy melodeon's lilt\" can tie the poem together.\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme. Each stanza should alternate rhymes. Let me test a couple lines: \"With spoons that clink and a frumious fiddle, / Beware the feep that fouls the tune!\" Yes, \"fiddle\" and \"tune\" rhyme, but wait, the second and fourth lines need to rhyme. So maybe adjust the second line's end.\n\nAlso, include interactive elements, like urging the reader to join in, to make it engaging. End with a triumphant return, celebrating the music's victory over challenges.\n\nLet me draft a stanza:\n\n\"'Tis brillig here where the wild whim whistles,\nAnd whiffling echoes sing a tune, librarian.\nWith spoons that clink and a frumious fiddle,\nBeware the feep that fouls the tune!\"\n\nHmm, \"whistles\" and \"fiddle\" don't rhyme. Maybe change \"whistles\" to \"whims\" to rhyme with \"fiddle\"? Not perfect. Alternatively, adjust the second line.

Maybe \"The Burnwicck's Lament\" or something similar with a possessive apostrophe to mimic the style.\n\nScreen burn-in refers to a ghostly image lingering on a screen. I should personify this as a creature causing trouble. Let's call the creature \"Flarion\" or \"Glintzel.\" The creature's actions should relate to burning images into the screen.\n\nNow, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an ABCB rhyme scheme. I'll follow that. Need to make up words that sound technical but fit the whimsy, like \"pixelfry\" or \"glowshade.\" The creature's arrival and the battle against it should be part of the narrative.\n\nIn the first stanza, set the scene with the creature appearing. Maybe \"Beware the Flarion, my son!\" to mirror the opening of \"Jabberwocky.\" Then describe the creature's effects: \"stuck in a loop, it doth sear.\" \n\nNext, introduce the setting: \"The pixels that dance in the dark of the screen.\" Then the creature's actions: \"With staticky teeth and a phosphor leer, / It fries the display year by year.\" \n\nInclude a technical term in a playful way, like \"OLED's plight\" and \"QLED's bane.\" Maybe some alliteration: \"the glow that doth cling\" and \"shimmerwings singe.\"\n\nThe middle part should have a build-up of the creature's menace. \"It stalks through the HUD, through the UI's hold, / Leaves navbars scorched, all forlorn and old.\" Then a warning: \"Beware the Flarion, the tech's heart's woe! / The JPEGs weep as it strikes below.\"\n\nThe climax could involve a struggle or a victim: \"It grabbed at the mouse with its garbled hand, / Left Netflix menus on a permanent stand.\" Then a memorial: \"And a sticker that read 'RIP—LCD' / Lived in the corner, half-dead as could be.\"\n\nFinally, a warning to take precautions: \"So mind all the timers, avoid static decay— / For a Flarion's burn-in ne'er fades away!\" That reinforces the theme of preventing screen burn-in.\n\nCheck for rhymes and meter.

It's full of nonsense words that sound meaningful, a playful rhythm, and a whimsical yet adventurous tone. So, I need to capture that essence but focus on stage wings.\n\nFirst, the title. \"Jabberwocky\" has a whimsical, alliterative title. Maybe something like \"Winglets of Whimsy-Wrack\"? \"Whimsy-Wrack\" sounds like a made-up place, similar to \"Tulgey Woods\". \n\nNext, the structure. The original has four-line stanzas with a consistent rhyme scheme, usually ABAB. I'll stick to that. Each stanza should tell part of a story, with some action and vivid imagery.\n\nNow, stage wings. They're the sides of the stage where actors wait. I need to personify them or make them part of a fantastical world. Maybe the wings are alive or have magical properties. The user wants a few invented coinages, so I'll create some words. \"Flumplenooks\" could be the creature mentioned, perhaps something that hides in the wings. \"Snicker-snee\" is from the original, but I should avoid copying, so maybe \"glibbleglow\" for the lights. \n\nThe poem needs a narrative. Let's have a protagonist navigating the stage wings, encountering fantastical creatures and overcoming challenges. The \"Jabberwock\" is a fearsome beast; our version could have the \"Mimsy Maw\" or \"F umplenooks\". \n\nInvented words: \"Whiffling\" (from the original) might be okay, but I need new ones. \"Jinklewiffs\" for the curtains? \"Gallimaufry\" means a dish of leftovers, but can be used to describe a mix of things. \"Splendiferous\" for splendid. \n\nRhyming and meter: Each line should be roughly iambic tetrameter. Let me check syllable counts. For example:\n\n\"Beware the Flumplenooks that creep\nWhere winglets whisper, dark and deep,\nTheir glibbleglow eyes agleam—\nA spectral show, a thespian dream.\"\n\nThat's four lines, ABAB rhyme, and flows like the original. The creature is named, and there's an invented word \"glibbleglow\". \n\nNext stanza: Maybe the protagonist takes action. \"He grasped the Snazzlepuff by thimbles...\" Snazzlepuff could be a prop, \"thimbles\" for fingers. \n\nInclude some stage elements: spotlights, curtains, stage fright. \"Forsooth!\" as an exclamation. The climax where the protagonist conquers the challenge: \"He soused the Mimsy Maw with Gleezle’s might\". \"Gleezle\" could be a magical essence. \n\nEnding with the stage going quiet, the show ends. \"The Winglets sighed their last ‘twixt gleam and gloom\". \n\nCheck for copied lines: I think it's safe. Now, review for the right style, invented words, creature name, and theme of stage wings. Looks good. Time to put it all together with the title.\n</think>\n\n**Winglets of Whimsy-Wrack**  \n\nBeware the Flumplenooks that creep  \nWhere winglets whisper, dark and deep,  \nTheir glibbleglow eyes agleam—  \nA spectral show, a thespian dream.  \n\n‘Tis brillig on the boards so bright,  \nThe Jinklewiffs clutch scripts too tight,  \n\"Flee stage-fright’s frothy fume!\" they cry,  \nAs spotlights yawn with gobbledy sigh.  \n\nHe seized the Snazzlepuff by thimbles bold,  \n\"Fie on your fizzled faux-retro gold!\"  \nForsooth!

Let me start by recalling what makes 'Jabberwocky' unique—its playful language, invented words, and rhythmic ballad structure. The poem needs a title, so maybe something like \"The Frumious Frying\" to mimic the original's playful titles.\n\nFirst, the admonition or preparation part. In 'Jabberwocky', the father warns the son about the Jabberwock. Here, the warning could be about the dangers of burning the butter. Need to invent some words here. Instead of \"Jabberwock\", maybe \"the frothjaws\" or \"splath\" to describe the butter's transformation.\n\nThen the journey of cooking the butter. Describe the process with whimsical terms. \"Mimsy\" from the original can become \"melt the mimsy salt\" to add flavor. The transition from regular butter to brown butter could involve a creature or a magical change, like \"Burble, bubble, the frothjaws sigh\" as it foams.\n\nThe celebratory return should highlight the success of browning the butter. Maybe the protagonist returns with the delicious result, using words like \"galumphing\" and \"frabjous\" to keep the style. Emphasize the tasty outcome with invented words: \"flumplenax\" or \"grooblux\" to describe the flavor.\n\nNeed to maintain the ABAB rhyme scheme and a bouncy meter. Let me check the syllables per line to ensure the rhythm matches. Add some alliteration and playful phrases. Make sure the admonition is clear—don't let it burn, or face the consequences. The celebration part should feel victorious, showing the joy of perfectly browned butter.\n\nInvented words: flibulge, frothjaws, splath, frumious, flumplenax, grooblux. Need to sprinkle these throughout. Maybe test some lines for flow and inventiveness. Avoid being too obscure but keep the nonsense feel.

It uses nonsense words that sound meaningful, playful language, and a narrative with fantastical creatures.\n\nFirst, I need a title. Maybe \"The Creep and the Snicker-Snack\"? That alliteration fits the style. Next, invent some creatures and coinages. The original has \"Jabberwock,\" \"Bandersnatch,\" so I should create similar-sounding names. Let's see... \"flibloom seeds\" could be something whimsical. A creature like \"mome-wumpus\" combines \"mome\" from the original and \"wumpus\" for a twist.\n\nThe poem needs a structure similar to the original: quatrains with a rhyme scheme, lively rhythm. Start setting the scene with a warning from the father. Use made-up verbs like \"ululation\" or \"thwickering.\" Incorporate actions and a battle with the creature. End with triumph but a lingering creepiness.\n\nCheck for any copied lines. Ensure the poem flows and maintains the whimsical yet ominous tone. Let me test some lines:\n\n\"Beware the mome-wumpus, my son!\nThe teeth that crunch, the claws that stun—\nWith eyes aglow like lanterns bright,\nIt stalks when moonbeams smother light.\"\n\nThat works.

The awl goes through challenging materials like \"glibblethorns\" and \"snickersteels\". \n\nThe celebratory return should show the awl's triumph, lots of creatures cheer, using alliteration and playful rhymes.

Carroll uses nonsense words, playful language, a ballad rhythm, and a structure that tells a story with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The poem also has a sense of adventure and danger, with an admonition and a triumphant return.\n\nFirst, the title. \"Jabberwocky\" has a whimsical, made-up title that suggests the fantastical content.

{"i": 16, "prompt": "Write a poem about umbrella in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem. Use a few invented coinages and a named creature. Avoid copying lines from the original.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about an umbrella in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Let me recall that 'Jabberwocky' by Lewis Carroll is known for its whimsical language, made-up words, and playful rhythm, usually with a consistent meter and rhyme scheme. The poem often features fantastical creatures and nonsense verses that still convey vivid imagery.\n\nFirst, I need to invent a title that sounds Jabberwocky-esque. Maybe something like \"The Snicker-Snack Shade\" or \"Brella's Frumious Flight\". Wait, \"The Snicker-Snack Shade\" has a nice ring to it, incorporating \"snicker-snack\" which is a term from the original poem.\n\nNext, I need to include a named creature. The original has the Jabberwock, so perhaps I can create something like \"gallewumpus\" or \"flumplenax\". Let's go with \"Gallewumpus\" and maybe another one like \"snickerwraith\". These names should be fantastical and fit the rhythm.\n\nThe umbrella is the main subject. I should personify it or make it an active element in the narrative. Maybe the umbrella is a tool to battle the weather creatures. So, the protagonist uses the umbrella against these beasts.\n\nNow, coinages are important. Words like \"galumphing\" from the original. Let me think of verbs and nouns: \"flibuljibits\", \"whiffling\", \"jinklewiff\", \"snicker-snack\" (already used in title), \"glibbleglorp\". These should be sprinkled throughout the verses to maintain the whimsy.\n\nStructure-wise, 'Jabberwocky' has four-line stanzas with an ABAB rhyme scheme. Each line is about eight syllables, with a trochaic meter. I need to match that as closely as possible.\n\nStarting the first stanza with setting the scene: \"Beware the feralsnarl, my son! / The flibuljibits bite; / Beware the gallewumpus when / The cloudsongs drown the light.\" Feralsnarl could be a weather-related creature, and cloudsongs to describe the storm.\n\nIntroducing the umbrella: \"Take the jinklewiff-handled brolly— / 'Twill thwart the snickerwraith— / Its canopy, a shimmerlure, / To tame the tempest's wrath.\" Jinklewiff for the handle, brolly as a slang for umbrella. Shimmerlure gives it a magical feel.\n\nAction sequence: \"The thunderboars came whiffling, all / Glibbleglorp and grey; / He twirled the snazzy umbra-sword, / Splishy-splashy fray!\" Thunderboars as storm creatures, whiffling and glibbleglorp as actions or descriptors. Umbra-sword makes the umbrella a weapon.\n\nClimax: \"Jubjub's lightning forked hellfire— / 'Twas grim, that snatheful day!— / He parried with a flick and—Oh! / The gallewumpus slayed!\" Incorporating hellfire, snatheful (a mix of snathe and awful?), and defeating the creature.\n\nEnding with the umbrella's victory and the aftermath: \"Now Mum's proud of his flazzlepox, / All bedabbled still, / Though puddings lithesome leap and laugh— / He holds the snicker-snack's thrill.\" Flazzlepox might describe his wounds or medals, bedabbled as wet, puddings lithesome as playful puddles.\n\nNeed to check the meter and rhyme scheme. Read each stanza aloud to ensure the rhythm matches. Adjust any lines that stumble. Make sure the invented words are sprinkled but not overwhelming, and the umbrella is glorified as the hero's tool.\n\nLastly, the title should be at the top, capitalized and centered if possible, but since the output is just the poem, ensure it's properly titled.

Let me start by recalling the original poem's structure and language. 'Jabberwocky' uses made-up words that sound real, playful rhythm, and a ballad form with quatrains and an ABAB rhyme scheme.\n\nFirst, I need a title that's catchy and alliterative, something like \"The Sciencery Scuffle\". That sets the scene with a playful twist. Next, the opening lines should introduce the setting, maybe morning, and a call to action. \"Beware the Hypotheen\" mirrors \"Beware the Jabberwock\" and introduces an invented word related to science—maybe hypothesis with a twist.\n\nThen, the narrator's journey: leaving home, heading to the fair. Using words like \"whiffling\" and \"floopenmoor\" adds that whimsical feel. The science fair itself needs elements like volcanoes, robots, and slime. Incorporating alliteration and invented terms here will help, like \"frothling\" for baking soda volcanoes and \"sproing\" for robot arms.\n\nThe challenge or conflict could be a rival project, maybe something with lasers and mirrors. Words like \"Zingpocket\" and \"fizzle frazzle\" create that playful tension. Then, the climax where the experiment works, using words like \"flarp\" and \"jinkle\" to describe the reaction.\n\nThe return home should be celebratory with a trophy, using phrases like \"galumphing\" and \"frabjulit\" to match the original's joyful ending. Ending with a repetition of the admonition ties it back to the opening, similar to 'Jabberwocky'.\n\nI need to check the rhyme scheme and meter, ensuring each stanza has four lines with the right rhythm.

Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\" uses made-up words, playful language, and a whimsical, slightly nonsense feel with a rhythmic meter. The poem also features a mythical creature, like the Jabberwock. \n\nFirst, the title. Maybe something like \"The Snickering Shutterwock\" to rhyme with Jabberwock and incorporate camera elements. The creature should have a name related to photography. \"Shutterwock\" combines shutter and Jabberwock.\n\nNext, the structure. Quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme, similar to the original. I need to invent some coinages. Words like \"filmsy,\" \"sprocketeer,\" \"exposules,\" \"developix,\" \"fixliate,\" \"darkslide,\" \"envelophase.\" These should sound technical but whimsical.\n\nIncluding camera-related actions: loading film, shutter clicks, developing, fixing. The creature's traits should involve photographic processes. Maybe the Shutterwock attacks with \"framerate\" claws or \"f-stop\" maw. The battle involves taking photos, using film as a weapon.\n\nThe ending needs a resolution. The protagonist defeats the Shutterwock by using the camera's flash, capturing its essence. Then they develop the film, preserving the memory. The closing line should mirror \"Jabberwocky,\" like \"and the Shutterwock’s sharp shriek grew still.\"\n\nCheck for original lines from \"Jabberwocky\" to avoid.

Let me start by recalling the characteristics of that poem. 'Jabberwocky' by Lewis Carroll uses nonsense words, playful language, and a whimsical yet adventurous tone, often with a clear rhyme scheme and structure.\n\nFirst, I need to capture the essence of a printer jam but make it fantastical. The original poem has a battle theme, so maybe liken the jam to a monster or a foe. The user mentioned an admonition or preparation and a celebratory return, so the structure should have those elements.\n\nThe title should be catchy and have alliteration, like \"The Frumious Jam-malarky\". \"Frumious\" is a Carrollian term, blending \"fuming\" and \"furious\", which fits the frustration of a jam. \"Jam-malarky\" combines jam with \"falcon\" maybe, or just a made-up word.\n\nNext, the opening stanza needs to set the scene. Something about the printer lying in wait, using invented words. Maybe \"Burble\" for the sound the printer makes, and \"flarp\" as a verb. The protagonist is warned by a figure, like the \"Mome of IT\", adding a playful character.\n\nFor the battle scene, the jam is personified as a \"Bandersnatch of paper\" with \"glibbage\" and \"flazzle\". The fight involves using tools like the \"vorpal Staple-o'matic\", which sounds whimsical and effective. The resolution should involve tearing free the jam, leading to a victory cry.\n\nThe celebratory return should involve things working smoothly again, with the printer now docile. Including words like \"glinten\" and \"mimsy\" ties back to Carroll's style. Ending with a warning to others to be cautious, using \"beware\" and a playful closing line.\n\nI need to check the rhyme scheme. 'Jabberwocky' uses ABAB, so each stanza should follow that. Invented words need to be sprinkled in without overcomplicating. Keep the rhythm bouncy and light, maintaining the ballad feel. Make sure the admonition is clear (beware the jam) and the celebration is triumphant.\n\nLet me piece it together step by step, ensuring each part flows and the playful language is consistent.

Words like \"glitzwings\" for the seagulls, \"roulette's whirlIncremer\" to mix roulette with a fantastical machine.\n\nThe structure should follow quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme.

In \"Jabberwocky\", the mother warns the protagonist.

Let me recall that \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll uses a lot of neologisms and playful language. The challenge here is to mimic that whimsical and nonsensical style while incorporating the theme of a map.\n\nFirst, I need to come up with a title. Maybe something that combines \"map\" with a fantastical suffix, like \"The Map Beyond Mazzle fray\". Sounds whimsical enough.\n\nNow, the poem should have a narrative, perhaps a journey through the map. Include a named creature. Carroll has the \"Jabberwock\", so maybe create something like \"Flish\" or \"Snicker-Snacks\". Wait, the user said to include a named creature, so let's invent one. \"Furniwog\" maybe?\n\nCoinages are important. Words like \"mazzle\", \"flurblen\", \"glibble-glade\". Need to make sure they fit the rhythm and meter. Each stanza should have a consistent structure, maybe four lines with an ABAB rhyme scheme.\n\nLet me outline the journey: starting with the map, encountering the Furniwog, navigating through fantastical terrains, a warning about not getting lost, and a triumphant return. Each verse introduces new made-up words and creatures.\n\nCheck if any lines are too similar to the original. Avoid \"slithy toves\" or \"vorpal blade\". Instead, use unique imagery related to maps and exploration. Phrases like \"squelch-through bogs of inkle blue\" or \"glibble-glade\" to describe areas on the map.\n\nEnsure the poem flows smoothly and maintains the playful, adventurous tone. Test the rhythm by reading it aloud. Adjust any clunky lines. Make sure the creature \"Furniwog\" is integrated into the narrative as a challenge the traveler must face.\n\nInclude a moral or lesson, like the importance of navigating wisely. End with a return home, changed by the journey. Use alliteration and assonance to enhance the musical quality. \"Beware the flibblejaws\" adds a touch of caution and fun.\n\nFinally, review for invented words, creature name, and adherence to the original style without copying lines.

Let me start by recalling what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It's got a playful ballad rhythm, lots of neologisms, and a whimsical, almost nonsensical feel, but with an underlying narrative. So I need to capture that playful cadence and invent some words.\n\nFirst, the title should be catchy and alliterative, maybe something like \"The Flickerwocky's Frame\" to mimic \"Jabberwocky.\" All right, that works. Now, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. I'll follow that.\n\nThe user mentioned an admonition or preparation and a celebratory return. So the poem should have a cautionary part and a triumphant ending. Let's outline the flow: introduce the camera, the process of taking a photo, some challenges, and then the joy of capturing the moment.\n\nInvented words are crucial here. Let me think of some. \"Snicker-snap\" for the shutter sound, \"flickerflame\" for the flash, \"glitzenbloom\" for the image, \"whirlytwirl\" for the film advancing. Maybe \"mistyveil\" for the uncertainty before development. Need to make sure these words hint at their meaning through context.\n\nAdmonition part: Maybe warn about missing the shot if not prepared. \"Beware the Mistyveil...\" Then the preparation, like loading the film, setting up. The celebratory return would be the joy of getting the perfect shot, the \"glitzenbloom\" appearing.\n\nNeed to maintain the ballad rhythm, so iambic tetrameter. Check each line's syllable count. Let's draft a stanza:\n\n'Beware the Flickerwock, my son!  \nThe jaws that bite, the flash that's sprung—  \nThe shutter's snicker-snap's undone  \nBy film that's frayed, or light that's stung.'\n\nHmm, \"Flickerwock\" as the playful name for the camera. Jaws that bite might refer to the camera's mechanism. \"Snicker-snap\" for the shutter. Challenges like frayed film or bad light.\n\nNext stanza about preparation. Maybe \"Take the Lens of Luminshade...\" Coined words here. Then instructions on how to shoot. \"Heed the whirlytwirl's soft chime\" refers to the film winding.\n\nAdmonition: \"Lest the moments, lost to time...\" emphasizes the importance of capturing the moment. Then the action of taking the photo: \"Pluck the shutter's silky thread...\" leading to the image being captured.\n\nCelebratory return: \"And lo! The Glitzenbloom... triumped in tones of hale and hues.\" The successful photograph. Ending with \"Shoot the Flickerwock with mirth!\" to encourage joyful photography.\n\nCheck rhyme scheme. Each stanza ABAB. Made-up words are sprinkled throughout. Playful and whimsical, meets the user's requirements.

Let me recall that \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll is known for its nonsense words, playful language, and whimsical creatures. The key elements to capture here are the made-up words, a rhythmic meter similar to the original, and the inclusion of a named, fantastical creature.\n\nFirst, I need to come up with a title that evokes the same curiosity and whimsy. Maybe something like \"The Jinglywiff's Refrain\" – \"Jinglywiff\" sounds musical and fits the invented creature requirement. \n\nNow, the poem structure. \"Jabberwocky\" uses quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme and a trochaic tetrameter meter. I'll need to maintain that structure. Let's brainstorm some music-related nonsense terms. Words like \"flumplenooks\" could be the instruments, \"squelchalopes\" might describe sounds, and \"glorpalones\" for echoes. \n\nThe creature, the Jinglywiff, should be a guardian or inhabitant of the music room. It needs an action, like dancing or creating music. Maybe it's a playful guardian that brings the room to life. \n\nI should describe the room's elements: instruments coming alive, sounds swirling, maybe some magical effects. Incorporate verbs that mimic musical actions but with a twist, like \"twirl\" or \"chime\". \n\nAvoid any direct lines from the original, so no \"Beware the Jabberwock\" references. Instead, focus on unique imagery. Check that each stanza flows and the made-up words fit naturally into the rhythm. \n\nLet me draft the first stanza, setting the scene and introducing the Jinglywiff. Then move through the room's elements, building up the musical magic. Ensure the creature is integral to the scene, maybe leading the musical chaos. Finally, conclude with the music fading but the memory lingering, true to the whimsical feel of Carroll's work.\n\nRead through the draft to check meter and rhyme. Adjust any lines that stumble.

That works.\n\nNow, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an ABCB rhyme scheme. I should follow that. Each stanza needs to have a playful cadence. Let's start with an admonition or preparation, as requested. Maybe warn the reader about the dangers of burning the butter. Use invented words here, like \"splink\" or \"floopjoy\". \n\n\"Beware the splink of froth\" – splink is a made-up word for the sound of bubbling butter. Then mention the \"floopjoy's hissy fray\" to describe the sizzling. Rhyme \"brown\" with \"frown\" to show the risk of overcooking.\n\nNext, the process of making brown butter. Use terms like \"melt the glub\" (glub as a noun for butter) and \"stir the rue\" (rue as a playful verb meaning stir). Add some alliteration: \"Simmer, slosh, and sloth\" – all S sounds for rhythm. Invent \"froth-fret\" to describe the foam forming.\n\nThen, the transformation. \"Flibberflam\" is a perfect nonsense word. Describe the butter changing: \"From cream to crunch, from pale to amber's kiss\". Use alliteration with \"crisp\" and \"curl\" to emphasize the texture.\n\nInclude the celebratory return. Maybe a feast scene with \"whiffling whoops\" and \"jiggly jam-jars\". \"Mallowfluff\" and \"sunbuttered toast\" as playful food terms. End with a toast to the brown butter, \"Gall Blair!\" as a cheers, maybe a nod to Carroll's \"Jabberwock\".\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme. Each stanza's last line rhymes with the second line. Keep the meter consistent, mostly iambic tetrameter. Use exclamation points and capitalization for emphasis, like Carroll did.\n\nMake sure to invent words that sound right but don't make the poem too obscure. Words like \"floopjoy\", \"glub\", \"froth-fret\", \"Gall Blair\" should fit the rhythm and add to the playful feel. Read it aloud to test the flow.\n\nFinally, ensure the poem has the required elements: preparation/admonition, the process, the transformation, celebration, and some invented terms. Keep it light-hearted and fun, capturing the essence of \"Jabberwocky\" while celebrating brown butter.\n</think>\n\n**The Flibberflam Fry**  \n\nBeware the splink of froth, my son!  \nThe floopjoy's hissy fray—  \nDon't let the butter burn to none,  \nLest supper ends in disarray!  \n\nMelt the glub, stir the rue,  \nSimmer, slosh, and sloth,  \nTill milk and solids part in two—  \nThe froth-fret whispers, \"Lo!\"  \n\nStraight through the greasy gulch it strays,  \nThrough pop and burble, frum—  \nIt curdles, crisps, and curls in praise:  \nThe brown blorple's come!  \n\nO frabjulice! The pan's aflame  \nWith nutty nim-nim rays!  \n Toast-bread, let the feast be named—  \nThe flibberflam's at bay!  \n\nSo clutch your spork, your flibul spoon,  \nLet whiffling whoops resound:  \nWith mallowfluff and jiggly jam-jar tune,  \nWe'll dine on sunbuttered ground!  \n\nGall Blair!

Maybe a warning, like \"Beware the Snickerwraith\". Then describe its actions: weaving static, disrupting signals. Next stanza introduces the conflict, someone facing the Snickerwraith with a tool, like a \"phazorblade\". \n\nInclude some action: cutting through interference, battling the creature. Then a climax where the protagonist succeeds but the Snickerwraith remains a threat. End with a moral or lingering presence.

Add an admonition or preparation and a celebratory return. Use some invented words.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about \"creep\" in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" Let me break down the requirements. First, I need to recall the features of Carroll's poem: playful language, made-up words, a rhythmic cadence, and a narrative structure that includes a challenge and a victorious return.\n\nThe title should be catchy, maybe something like \"The Creep's Slivvy Quest\" using a mix of real and invented words. The poem needs an admonition or preparation section where the protagonist is warned about the Creep. Then, the journey into the dangerous, whimsical landscape, encountering strange creatures. The climax is facing the Creep, using nonsense verbs like \"gallizank\" or \"jinkle.\" Finally, a celebratory return where the hero is hailed with whimsical terms like \"momeflung\" and \"flumplenooks.\"\n\nI should maintain the ballad rhythm, probably iambic tetrameter with an ABAB rhyme scheme. Invented words need to fit the meter and enhance the playful tone. Words like \"snickerplacks,\" \"slivvy,\" \"glorblatt,\" and \"frumious\" (a nod to Carroll) can add authenticity. The admonition comes from a \"wise old wuggle,\" advising caution. The return should be joyful with a feast and celebration, emphasizing victory over the Creep.\n\nCheck for consistent rhythm and rhyme. Ensure the invented words don't disrupt the flow. Make sure the structure mirrors \"Jabberwocky\" with stanzas of four lines, building up the adventure and resolving with triumph. Avoid being too obscure; keep the playful spirit accessible. Test the cadence by reading aloud. Adjust any lines that stumble. Include vivid, fantastical imagery to paint the eerie yet lively setting.

Let me recall that \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll uses a lot of made-up words, playful language, and a rhythmic ballad structure. So first, I need to capture that whimsical and nonsense feel but apply it to a science fair theme.\n\nThe title should reflect the theme and maybe include a playful twist. Maybe something like \"Science Frabberwock\" to mimic the original's \"Jabberwocky\".\n\nNext, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an AABB rhyme scheme and a consistent iambic tetrameter. I need to keep that cadence. Let me think about the elements of a science fair: experiments, models, maybe chaos and excitement. Incorporating invented words is crucial here. Words like \"flumplenooks\" for maybe test tubes or equipment, \"snickerwhip\" for a reaction or something unexpected.\n\nThe user also wants an admonition or preparation part. In \"Jabberwocky\", the father warns the son about the Jabberwock. Here, maybe a teacher advising the student to be careful with their experiments. Then a celebratory return, like returning victorious after the fair.\n\nSo outline the poem: start with setting the scene of the science fair, the strange creatures (invented words), the preparation/admonition, the action (conducting experiments), facing challenges (maybe something going wrong), and then the successful return with a prize or praise.\n\nMake sure to keep the playful rhymes and rhythm. Let me check for the AABB rhyme scheme. Each stanza four lines. Use alliteration and assonance where possible. Also, ensure the invented words make sense in context, even if they're nonsense. Maybe \"burble\" for bubbling, \"fizzle frazzle\" for a reaction.\n\nTest a stanza: \"Beware the Frabberwock, my son! / The tests that bite, the grades that stun, / Beware the Flarp’s bright flibulous glare— / Lest thou a failing mark declare!\" That has the AABB rhyme and the rhythm. The words \"Frabberwock\", \"Flarp\", \"flibulous\" are invented but fit the warning tone.\n\nThen move through the journey: gathering supplies, mixing things, facing setbacks, then triumph. The celebratory return could have the student coming back with a trophy or praise, using words like \"galumphing\" (from the original) and \"jubjub\" maybe as cheers.\n\nCheck for consistent meter.

Maybe something like \"The Foggrawock\"? Combines \"fog\" with a nonsense suffix. Then, the structure: quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme, similar to the original. \n\nInvented coinages are required. Words like \"flumplenooks\" could be creatures or things in the fog.

Let me recall that 'Jabberwocky' uses made-up words, playful language, and a ballad rhythm. So I need to invent some terms, maybe something like \"snickerwings\" or \"flumplenooks\" to give it that whimsical feel.\n\nFirst, the title. \"Ode to the Confabulux Chamber\" sounds Jabberwocky-esque. Now, the structure: quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. The original has a consistent meter, so I'll aim for iambic tetrameter.\n\nThe poem needs an admonition or preparation and a celebratory return. The admonition could be warnings about the dangers of the conference room—like tedious meetings. Use words like \"Beware the Snickerwings\" to mimic \"Beware the Jabberwock\". Then the preparation might involve bringing snacks or a \"scream.beholder\" (a playful term for a device).\n\nFor the celebratory return, after surviving the meeting, there should be rejoicing. Maybe mention escaping the \"Flarping Dread\" and returning home with victory. Include made-up verbs like \"frumious\" or \"galumphing\" to stay true to the style.\n\nCheck the rhyme and rhythm.

They mentioned including a title, invented coinages, and a named creature. First, I need to recall \"Jabberwocky\"'s features: nonsense words, playful language, a mythical quest, and a specific rhythm.\n\n\"Third rail hum\" makes me think of subway or train systems. The third rail is electrified, so there's a buzzing sound. I should personify this hum as a creature or magical entity. The original has the Jabberwock, so maybe invent a creature like \"Flumplax\" or \"Zingara.\"\n\nNext, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an ABCB rhyme scheme and a galloping meter. Each stanza sets a scene with made-up words. I need to capture the eerie yet rhythmic feeling of the subway.\n\nInvented coinages: maybe \"slurms\" for shadows, \"glitzens\" for lights, \"squelchle\" for a sound effect. The creature's name should be unique but fit the rhythm. \"Squelchmire Snorp\" sounds suitably Jabberwocky-esque.\n\nInclude elements of movement, danger, and a journey. The protagonist might confront the creature embodying the hum. Use alliteration and assonance to mimic the original's flow.\n\nAvoid direct lines from \"Jabberwocky.\" Instead, paraphrase the structure. Start with a warning, describe the setting, introduce the creature, the confrontation, and resolve with the hum's presence.\n\nCheck the rhythm: each line should have around 8 syllables with a stressed-unstressed pattern. Let me draft a few lines.\n\n\"Beware the Squelchmire Snorp, my son!\nThe tracks that slink where slurms are spun,\nBeware the glitzens' gleam and play,\nAnd shun the third rail's thrum by day.\"\n\nThat's a start. Now the creature's description. \"Jaws that jolt with juice uncouth\" relates to electricity. \"Maws agape\" adds menace. The snorp's movement: \"with scribble-sparks it throbs and sings.\"\n\nNext, the narrator's approach: \"He took the Glocken-Pipe in hand...\" Glocken-Pipe as a tool. \"Vorpal\" from original is famous, but user said to avoid copying, so maybe \"vorreon\" or another term. Wait, the user said to avoid copying lines, so don't use \"vorpal blade\" but create a similar feel.\n\n\"Long time the manxle-runes did gleam...\" Manxle-runes as mysterious markings. The Hum's effect: \"my whiskers twitched to the live rail's hymn.\"\n\nConfrontation: \"And as in corkscrew dark I stood, / The Snorp's thrum-buzz did whip the flood.\" Then action: \"I lunged with the oglor Ajax flair, / And--snick!--the Hum ceased its vaulted prayer.\"\n\nBut wait, the third rail hum is constant; maybe the poem should end with it remaining, a lingering presence. So perhaps the creature isn't slain but acknowledged. \"Yet still in tunnels deep it thrums, / The third rail's anthem, hymn of hums.\"\n\nTesting the structure, rhyme, and invented words. Ensure each stanza flows and the creature feels integrated. Check for consistent meter and playful language. Revise any lines that don't fit the rhythm or style.

Invented words should blend with tech terms in a playful way.\n\nCheck the rhythm. Each line should have a similar meter, maybe iambic tetrameter. Let's draft the first stanza: \"Beware the Burn-In Bandersnatch, my son, / The glimmerjaws that cling, / The mimsy memes with static grins / That mar the screen with sting.\" Yes, that flows.\n\nNow the preparation: mention using intervals and changing scenes. \"Take vorpal intervals with care, / And shift the glows that play, / Lest stillborn sprites in corners lair / And fuse with pixelclay.\" Invented words here: vorpal intervals, pixelclay.\n\nThe battle scene: \"He girds his screen of phosphor mesh, / A flicker-fray to face, / With gyroscrolls he sweeps the mesh, / And shakes the stagnant space.\" Using gyroscrolls as a made-up term for movement on the screen.\n\nClimax where burn-in is defeated: \"Then came the Wailer, fixed and grim, / With logos grained in bone, / ‘I’ll sear my mark!’ the specter brimmed, / But still the screens did stroll!\" Maybe use \"Wailer\" as a creature causing burn-in.\n\nFinally, the return with celebration: \"‘Tis done!’ the victor clicks with glee, / As pixels dance anew, / ‘My glyphs now flow where ghosts did be!’ / So warn the Bandersnatch—‘Nay, you!’\" Emphasize victory and warning others.\n\nCheck for rhyme and rhythm consistency.

{"i": 39, "prompt": "Write a poem about printer jam in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem. Keep a playful ballad cadence with some rhyme. Add an admonition or preparation and a celebratory return. Use some invented words.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about a printer jam in the style of \"Jabberwocky\". Let me recall what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It's got a playful, nonsense vibe with made-up words that still sound meaningful. The rhythm is pretty consistent, with a ballad meter—four beats per line, alternating stresses.\n\nFirst, I need a title that captures the essence of a printer jam but with a whimsical twist. Maybe something like \"The Frumious Jam\" since \"frumious\" is a blend of \"fuming\" and \"furious\" from the original poem. That fits the frustrating yet fantastical theme.\n\nNow, the structure. The original has quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. I'll stick to that. Start with an admonition, warning the reader about the dangers of the printer jam. Then build up the action, maybe a battle with the jam itself, using invented words for the printer parts: \"glitzen\", \"flamber\", \"snick\". \n\nThe middle part should have a climax where the jam is confronted. Maybe personify the jam as a beast. Then, after the struggle, a triumphant return where the printer works again, with celebratory language. Need some playful terms here, like \"burble\" and \"chortle\", similar to Carroll's style.\n\nCheck the invented words: \"glitzen\" could mean shiny parts, \"flamber\" a mix of flame and ember for the printer's heat, \"snick\" a sharp sound. Make sure they blend in without breaking the flow. Rhymes need to be consistent but not too forced. Lines should flow with a bouncy cadence.\n\nAlso, include an admonition at the start and a celebration at the end. Maybe open with \"Beware the Glitzen\" to mirror \"Beware the Jabberwock\". Use alliteration where possible, like \"frazzled gears\" and \"vicious loop of fate\". \n\nNow, assemble the verses. First stanza sets the scene, second the problem arises, third the battle, fourth the victory, fifth the return. Check syllable count to maintain the meter. Read it aloud to ensure the rhythm matches the original's feel.\n\nPotential tweaks: \"Furble\" as a verb for malfunctioning, \"splin\" for a part of the paper. Make sure each invented word contributes to the imagery without confusing. End with a return to normalcy, using terms like \"roars to life\" and \"victorious shout\" to emphasize triumph.\n\nFinal check: Title included, playful cadence, invented words, rhyme scheme, and the required elements of admonition, struggle, celebration. Looks good. Time to put it all together.\n</think|\n\nThe Frumious Jam  \nBeware the Glitzen, my son, and shun  \nThe frumiousJam that’s come undone—  \nWith frazzled gears and inkjet’s scorn,  \nIt mocks thy deadlines, born forlorn.  \n\n‘Tis vorpal blades of paper’s spite,  \nIn twisted loops, a hissing blight,  \nBeneath the tray, it gnashes tight,  \nAnd burbles froth of “Error’s Light.”  \n\nFlamber the rollers, spin and tweet,  \nAs thou dost wrestle, sweat and fleet,  \nThrough mimsy snicks of “Retry!” beat—  \nYet lo!

Avoid copying lines from the original.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about déjà vu in the style of 'Jabberwocky' with a title, some invented words, a named creature, and no copied lines. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the style of 'Jabberwocky'. It's known for its nonsense words, playful language, and a narrative structure with a heroic quest. The rhythm is trochaic, which is a strong, rhythmic pattern. So, I should maintain that meter.\n\nThe theme is déjà vu. How to convey that feeling of familiar strangeness? Maybe use imagery that's both vivid and slightly off-kilter. Invented coinages are necessary—perhaps blend parts of real words related to memory or time. Words like \"remeant\" (from \"re-mean\" or \"re-meant\") or \"timefraze\" (time freeze) could work.\n\nA named creature is required. Carroll used the Jabberwock; I need something that embodies déjà vu. \"The Remnori\" – from \"reminisce\" or \"memory\". It should be something that the protagonist confronts, creating that sense of familiarity.\n\nStructure-wise, start with a setting, introduce the creature, the challenge, and the resolution. Use alliteration and archaic language for that authentic feel. Avoid any direct lines from the original but mimic the structure.\n\nLet me draft the first stanza, setting the scene with \"sunless\" and \"shimmmerglade\" to create a dreamlike atmosphere. Then introduce the Remnori with a warning. The middle stanzas can describe the encounter, using coined words to build the eerie, familiar tension. The resolution should leave the reader with the lingering feeling of déjà vu, perhaps with the creature vanishing as suddenly as it appeared.\n\nCheck for meter consistency and ensure the invented words fit naturally. Make sure the creature's actions reflect the déjà vu experience—flickering, echoes, shifting scenes. End with the title that encapsulates the theme, maybe \"The Remnori's Grin\" to tie the creature to the familiar yet unsettling smile of déjà vu.\n</think>\n\n**The Remnori's Grin**  \n\n'Twas sunless, and the shimmmerglade did steam,  \nWhere frabjul eyes in haze did twinkle quaint—  \n\"All bemused!\" the mome linguist would beam,  \n\"The clocks gang aft, yet naught but slivs remain.\"  \n\nBeware the Remnori, that fainz'd decree,  \nWith frazzlespate and chronon-chested leer,  \nIt stalks where memries in mirrshee flee,  \nAnd replayscapes dissolve to fervid here.  \n\nI sought the glimmerbight with restless quill,  \nMy soulfelt satchel stuffed with frumious notes,  \nWhen lo—a flickerclaw, a glint, a will-  \nO'-the-wisp that wove through trompelœil throats.  \n\n\"Regrant, regrant!\" it chorused, void of tongue,  \nYet syllables seeped from my own mouth gone—  \nThe scathe of half-known scenes, the déjà sprung,  \nA timefraze drenched in brume where I'd been shone.  \n\nGallimaunce!

Maybe \"squelch\" as a verb for silencing wrong notes.\n\nInclude a menacing force in the music room—perhaps \"the Screetch\" that represents chaos or difficult music. The hero uses the Muzicry Mallet to defeat it, restoring harmony.\n\nEnsure the rhythm is playful and bouncy, with alliteration and internal rhymes.

They also don't want any direct lines from the original. Let me start by recalling the \"Jabberwocky\" style. It uses a lot of portmanteaus and nonsense words that sound meaningful. The structure is quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme and a consistent meter.\n\nFirst, the title. Maybe something like \"The Layover Bay Beetections\" combining \"beetle\" and \"detections\"? Wait, \"Beetections\" isn't perfect. Alternatively, \"The Layover Bay Borogroves\" but Borogoves are from the original. Need an original creature. Let's call it a \"Snickerwack\". Hmm, not sure. Maybe \"Glintzenfins\" as a creature name.\n\nInvented coinages: need to create words that fit the whimsical feel. Words like \"flumplenook\", \"snickelgrass\", \"jinkleplack\", \"floopet wings\". The creature could be the \"Snurblatt\". Let me check the rhyme and rhythm.\n\nFirst stanza: Setting the scene at Layover Bay. Mention the time of day, maybe twilight. Introduce the creature. \"Beware the Snurblatt's glintzenfins, / That flibber in the dusk's loose nets—\" Hmm, \"dusk's loose nets\" gives a vague, mystical image. Then the action: \"It mimsies mid the muzzled piers, / Where frothy tonguesters fest'.\" \"Mimsies\" is from the original, though. Should avoid that. Replace with \"It lurks\".\n\nNext stanza: Describe the environment. \"The snickelgrass in swirls does grow, / And jinkleplack seeds splay—\" \"Snickelgrass\" and \"jinkleplack\" are new. Then a warning: \"Take heed, for time here slithers slow— / The clocks all chew their hours astray.\" Clocks chewing hours gives a sense of time distortion.\n\nThird stanza: The creature's appearance. \"Its fimbulfangs in briny air / Do glimmer, glaucous, cold— / It whiffling waits with flop-eared care, / Where jellynauts their vigils hold.\" \"Fimbulfangs\" from original? Wait, \"fimbulfly\" is in Jabberwocky. Maybe use \"fimbulfangs\" as a variation. \"Jellynauts\" instead of real creatures.\n\nFourth stanza: The traveler's dilemma. \"So should you pause on Layover's shore, / Watch for the Snurblatt's sly pounce— / Lest in its maw, lost, you implore, / The tides to fetch you from this trounce!\" Emphasizes the danger, using \"trounce\" as a playful word.\n\nCheck for meter: Each line should be eight syllables, iambic tetrameter. Let's scan:\n\nBeware the Snurblatt's glintzenfins, (8)\nThat flibber in the dusk's loose nets— (8)\nIt lurks mid muzzled piers' embrace, (8)\nWhere frothy tonguesters fest' (7) Hmm, maybe \"festers\" to make 8? \"Where frothy tonguesters fester\".\n\nAdjust lines for consistency. Also, ensure invented words are original and not copied. The creature name \"Snurblatt\" is new. The coinages like \"glintzenfins\", \"flibber\", \"muzzled piers\", \"tonguesters\", \"snickelgrass\", \"jinkleplack\", \"slithers slow\", \"chew their hours\", \"fimbulfangs\", \"glaucous, cold\", \"whiffling\", \"flop-eared care\", \"jellynauts\", \"vigils hold\", \"trounce\".\n\nSeems okay. Title: \"The Layover Bay Snurblatt\". Wait, the user said to include a title. Maybe \"The Layover Bay Beetections\" was a stretch. Alternatively, use the creature's name: \"The Layover Bay Snurblatt\". Or \"Snurblatt of Layover Bay\". But the example in \"Jabberwocky\" is \"'Twas brillig...\" with the title separate. So the poem's title should be distinct. Maybe \"The Layover Bay Borogroves\" but avoiding original terms. \"Layover Bay's Flibberjibits\"? Not sure. Let's go with \"Of Layover Bay's Frabjulon Tide\" – \"frabjulon\" is a nonsense word, \"tide\" relates to the bay.\n\nPutting it all together, ensuring original lines and creature name. Avoid \"mimsies\" and \"galumphing\". Now check each line for uniqueness and style.

Add an admonition or preparation and a celebratory return. Use some invented words.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about a conference room in the style of \"Jabberwocky\". Let me recall that \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll uses lots of made-up words, playful language, and a ballad rhythm. So I need to invent some nonsense terms related to meetings and office environments.\n\nFirst, the title should be catchy and a bit whimsical. Maybe something like \"The Burblewock's Boardroom Bout\". \"Burble\" sounds like a mix of babble and bubble, suggesting the nonsense talk in meetings. \"Bout\" implies a struggle, which fits the adversarial feel of some conferences.\n\nNext, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. I'll follow that. The first stanza needs to set the scene with some invented creatures or terms. Words like \"momeflakes\" (a mix of mome from the original and flakes, maybe referring toaimless people), \"glinsk\" (a shiny but possibly useless thing), \"snicker-snack\" from the original can be adapted here.\n\nThen the admonition part. In \"Jabberwocky\", the father warns the son about the Jabberwock. Here, maybe warn about the \"Burblewock\" with made-up verbs like \"ululate\" and \"flunge\". The preparation could involve taking a \"vorpal pen\" instead of a sword, keeping the playful tone.\n\nThe battle scene in the conference room. Use terms like \"slithy salespitch\", \"frumious flowcharts\" (frumious is from the original), \"bandersnatch budgets\". The protagonist outsmarts the Burblewock with jargon, leading to its defeat.\n\nThe return should be celebratory. Maybe the protagonist returns with the \"snech of the hour\" (snech as a nonsense achievement), everyone cheers, and there's a feast with wordplay on office snacks like \"mimsy muffins\" and \"coffee that's frabjuliced\".\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme and rhythm. Each stanza should have four lines with alternating rhymes. The made-up words need to fit the stress patterns of the original. Also, ensure playful and whimsical language throughout, with the right mix of invented terms and recognizable conference room elements.\n\nLet me draft the stanzas step by step, ensuring each part transitions smoothly and maintains the ballad cadence. Read it aloud to test the rhythm. Adjust any words that don't fit the meter. For example, \"He took the vorpal pen in hand\" mirrors \"He took the vorpal sword in hand\" from the original. Replace \"galumphing\" with \"flunge\" to keep the action moving.\n\nInclude an admonition from a mentor figure, the battle with the Burblewock using jargon, and a triumphant return. Make sure the celebratory ending contrasts with the initial danger, highlighting the protagonist's success.

The title should be catchy with alliteration.\n\nFirst, the title. \"The Awl's Frumious Pursuit\" – \"frumious\" is a nod to Carroll's \"frumious bandersnatch.\" Good start.\n\nNext, the setting. \"Twas brillig and the sl Kummocks\" – \"sl\" as a prefix gives it a Carroll-esque feel. Kummocks as creatures, maybe they're grumpy or rocky. \"Borogove\" referenced, but I need a new creature. \"Snicker-snack\" is from the original, but the user said to avoid copying lines. Wait, the user said not to copy lines, so I should replace that. Maybe \"flibulax\" as a nonsense action.\n\nThe protagonist takes the awl, \"a bodkin keen.\" Then introduces a new creature, \"Jabblux\" with \"tusked with glimmerwings.\" The battle scene: \"He charged the beast\" with the awl's power. The outcome: slaying the Jabblux, ending with a moral about the awl's might.\n\nNeed invented coinages: \"mome,\" \"ultragoop,\" \"flibulax,\" \"gallimaus,\" \"glimmerwings,\" \"Vallumwaif,\" \"loofa-chortled.\" These should fit the rhythm and meter.\n\nCheck the structure: quatrains, similar rhyme scheme, whimsical words. Ensure it's not too similar to the original lines but captures the essence. Avoid direct phrases from \"Jabberwocky,\" so instead of \"vorpal blade,\" use \"bodkin keen.\" \n\nDoes it tell a mini story? A hero faces a creature and wins with the awl.

They also want invented words, an admonition, and a celebratory return. Let me start by recalling the structure of \"Jabberwocky.\" It has a strong meter, lots of neologisms, and a narrative that includes a challenge and a triumph.\n\nFirst, I need to define \"creep\" in this context. Maybe personify it as a sneaky creature. Invented words... think of portmanteaus or nonsense terms that hint at slimy, sneaky movements. Words like \"slinkle\" or \"glibble\" could work. Rhyming scheme is important—maybe quatrains with ABAB rhyme.\n\nThe admonition part should warn the reader about the creep. The celebratory return needs a victorious ending, so the protagonist overcomes the creep. Let's outline the poem: introduction of the creep, the warning, the battle, and the triumphant return.\n\nNeed to maintain the playful cadence. Use alliteration and assonance to keep it flowing. Let me draft the first stanza. Something like \"Beware the Creep who slinkles in\" to mimic \"Beware the Jabberwock.\" Then introduce some actions of the creep, maybe \"jink and jim-jam\" for playful movement.\n\nFor the invented words, ensure they sound like they could mean something related to creeping. \"Flish\" for a quick escape, \"flum\" for a sound. The admonition comes early, then the preparation, like a vorpal blade but adjusted—maybe \"trust your glimmerblade.\" The battle scene with some nonsense verbs, and the victory with a celebration. End with a return home, having defeated the creep, using cheerful language.\n\nCheck the meter—each line should have a similar syllable count and stress pattern. Read it aloud to ensure it flows. Revise any lines that stumble. Make sure the rhyme is consistent but not forced. Add some celebratory elements in the final stanza, maybe a feast or cheering crowd.

Carroll has the Jabberwock, Bandersnatch, etc. Let's invent a creature related to desire paths. Maybe \"Snicker-Snacks\" or \"Gleebeasts\"? Wait, the user mentioned a named creature. \"Glimmerwings\" might be too serene. How about \"Gleeburrs\"? They could be obstacles that the path navigates. Or \"Bramblewights\" – something that entangles but is overcome by desire.\n\nSetting the scene: twilight, a forest, the path appears. Use nonsense verbs like \"wriggled\" or \"wove.\" Make the path active, almost alive. \"Wizzle\" as a verb? Maybe \"wizzles\" through the trees. Include some onomatopoeia like \"squelch\" or \"sough.\"\n\nDescribing the journey: moving through obstacles. The creature's lair, maybe with \"Gleeburrs\" that \"snickered\" or \"snarled.\" Battle of wills between the traveler and the creature. Use alliteration: \"frabjulon\" flame? Wait, Carroll uses that. Avoid direct copies. Instead, \"flibloom\" or \"flumplenooks.\"\n\nClimax: confronting the creature, perhaps with a mirror-like shield reflecting the path's desire. The path's persistence triumphs. Ending with the path leading to a destination, maybe a village, showing the result of desire.\n\nCheck for coinages: \"wizzle,\" \"flibloom,\" \"Gleeburrs,\" \"Snicker-Snacks.\" Ensure they fit rhythmically.

Add an admonition or preparation and a celebratory return. Use some invented words.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a poem about morning fog in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" Let's start by recalling what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It's a nonsense poem by Lewis Carroll, known for its made-up words, playful language, and a rhythmic, ballad-like structure with a consistent rhyme scheme, usually ABAB.\n\nFirst, the title. The original has \"Jabberwocky,\" so maybe something like \"The Fog of Frumious Dawn\" to incorporate \"frumious,\" which is a blend of \"fuming\" and \"furious\" from the original. That fits the playful, invented feel.\n\nNext, the structure. Quatrains with four-line stanzas, each with an ABAB rhyme scheme. The cadence should be lively, with a mix of iambs and trochees, similar to the galloping rhythm of \"Jabberwocky.\"\n\nInvented words: I'll need to create some. Maybe \"snicker-snacks\" could be adapted to \"snickerfog\" or \"mimsy\" to \"mimsy mist.\" Also, terms like \"whiffling\" or \"burble\" might work. Let me brainstorm some fog-related nonsense words: \"glibble,\" \"splink,\" \"flumplenooks,\" \"twizzle,\" \"gallimaufry.\"\n\nThe poem should have an admonition or preparation part, then a journey through the fog, and a celebratory return. So, maybe start with a warning to brave the fog, then describe the challenges within it, and end with triumph and return.\n\nFirst stanza: Introduce the fog and the need for preparation. Use \"frumious\" and a made-up creature, like \"jubjub birds\" but maybe adapt it to \"Fumblers.\" \n\"Beware the frumious dawn's befogged might,\nWhen Fumblers grope and Glimmerwings take flight;\nThe mimsy mist that munches, slimy-bright—\nBeware the Fog of Frumious Dawn's cold bite!\"\n\nSecond stanza: The journey into the fog. Use \"whiffling\" and \"burble\" sounds. Maybe \"splink\" as a verb. Introduce another creature. \n\"With snicker-snik with glimmer-blade in hand,\nWe splink through slurries of a glibble-land;\nThe Frumious Fog froths, whirls in jubjub bands—\nBeware its wuggle-snouts that flumplenooks demand!\"\n\nThird stanza: The confrontation or challenge. Use \"twizzle\" and \"gallimaufry.\" \n\"Beneath the k CHIP of moon's milky eye,\nWe twizzle through its woolly gallimaufry.\nFrumious fangs may nip and vapors sigh—\nBut brave the Fog-wool's snicker-fog, and try!\"\n\nFourth stanza: The triumphant return. Celebratory tone with \"whiffling\" and \"burble.\" \n\"Then when the sun's first snortlein splits the gray,\nWe'll whiffle back, with burbles, jigging gay.\nFor those who brave the Frumious Fog's dismay\nShall prance in Zingpocket's glimmer-fray!\"\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme. Each stanza should follow ABAB. Let me verify:\n\nFirst stanza: might, flight, bright, bite – yes, ABAB.\nSecond: hand, land, bands, demand – ABAB.\nThird: eye, gallimaufry (slant rhyme?), sigh, try. Hmm, \"gallimaufry\" and \"eye\" don't rhyme perfectly. Maybe adjust to \"gallimaufry\" and \"try\" – needs fixing. Let me change the third stanza's first line end to \"gallimaufry\" and third line to \"try.\" Maybe:\n\n\"Beneath the moon's milky mimsy maw,\nWe twizzle through its woolly gallimaufry.\nFrumious fangs may nicker-snack and gnaw—\nBut brave the Fog-wool's snicker-fog, and draw!\"\n\nNow the rhymes are maw, gallimaufry (still a problem). Maybe rephrase:\n\n\"Beneath the moon's mimsy twinkling eye,\nWe twizzle through its wuggle gallimaufry.\nFrumious fangs may nicker-snack and sigh—\nBut brave the Fog-wool's snicker-fog, and try!\"\n\nNow eye, gallimaufry (still not perfect), but Carroll used slant rhymes. Maybe acceptable. Alternatively, change \"gallimaufry\" to \"gallimaufry\" and the end word. Not sure. Alternatively, use \"galimatlas\" or another word.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n\"Beneath the moon's mimsy glimmer-shroud,\nWe twizzle through the Fog's own gallimaufry.\nFrumious fangs may nicker-snack and cloud—\nBut brave the snicker-fog, and jabber proud!\"\n\nShroud, gallimaufry, cloud, proud – slant rhymes. Maybe it's okay in the style.\n\nAlternatively, stick with original and accept near rhymes as Carroll did.\n\nFinally, check the meter. Each line should be around 8-10 syllables, with a trochaic beat. Let's see:\n\n\"Beware the fru-MI-us dawn's be-FOGG-ed MIGHT,\" (11 syllables) – maybe trim to \"Beware the frumious dawn's befogged might,\" (10 syllables). Good.\n\nContinue this for each line. Ensure the cadence is playful and ballad-like.\n\nNow, compile all the stanzas with the title. Read through for flow and adherence to the style. Make sure there's an admonition (beware), preparation (with glimmer-blade), the journey, and the celebratory return with \"whiffling\" and \"jigging gay.\"\n\nInvented words: frumious, Fumblers, Glimmerwings, mimsy mist, snicker-snik, glibble-land, Frumious Fog, wuggle-snouts, flumplenooks, k CHIP (maybe \"k'chip\"?), milky eye, gallimaufry, snortlein, Zingpocket's glimmer-fray.\n\nYes, this should meet the requirements.

{"i": 48, "prompt": "Write a poem about third rail hum in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem. Use a few invented coinages and a named creature. Avoid copying lines from the original.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about the \"third rail hum\" in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" Let me break this down. First, I need to recall what \"Jabberwocky\" is like. It's a nonsense poem by Lewis Carroll with made-up words, playful language, and a whimsical feel, but also a narrative structure. The key elements are invented coinages, a named creature, and the style that balances chaos with rhythm.\n\nThird rail hum refers to the sound of electricity in subway systems. So, I need to translate that into a fantastical setting. Carroll uses creatures like the Jabberwock, Bandersnatch, etc. I should invent a creature related to the third rail, maybe something electrical or mechanical.\n\nNext, the coinages. Words like \"whiffling,\" \"galumphing\" from the original. I need to make similar words that evoke the sound or the movement related to the third rail. Maybe \"snickerlings\" for sparks, \"glowspires\" for lights, \"VDUs\" as a monster (maybe an acronym, like Voltage Draining Usurpers?).\n\nThe title should be catchy and Carroll-esque. Maybe alliterative and with some invented words. \"The Frumious Third Rail's Hum\" — \"frumious\" is from the original (a blend of fuming and furious), so that's a good nod.\n\nStructure: Quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme, like \"Jabberwocky.\" Each stanza introduces a creature or an action. The narrative should have a clear progression: setting the scene, introducing the threat (the third rail hum), the battle or action, and the aftermath.\n\nLines to avoid copying from the original. So no \"slithy toves\" or \"vorpal blade.\" But the rhythm and meter should match—mostly eight-syllable lines with some variation.\n\nFirst stanza: Introduce the setting, the subway as a strange world. Maybe \"Beware the Snicker-Snack\" as a creature? Wait, no, the main creature here should be the third rail's hum. Or maybe a monster that embodies the hum. Let's call it \"the Zhisser\" or \"the Hum-wyrm.\" Hmm.\n\nWait, \"Jabberwocky\" starts with \"Twas brillig and the slithy toves...\" So first line sets the scene. Let me do something similar. \"Beware the Snicker-Snack’s sharp bite, / The frumious hum that gnaws the night—\" Here, Snicker-Snack could be a creature, and the hum is a separate element. The third rail's hum is the central phenomenon, so maybe it's created by a creature.\n\nNext, introducing the traveler: \"Take warning as you wend the deep, / Where glowspires sing in gloom asleep,\" Glowspires could be the lights in the tunnel. The traveler hears the hum and encounters the creature.\n\nInvented coinages: \"VDUs\" as a monster (Voltage DrainingUsurpers?), \"Flish\" (a blend of flash and fish?), \"Flish that flibulux in the dark.\" Flibulux could be a verb meaning sparkling or moving quickly. Maybe \"Flish\" are the sparks.\n\nClimax: The confrontation with the third rail's creature. \"He drew the Quizzlerod of old, / To quell the spark that time had stole;\" Quizzlerod is an invented weapon, maybe something that disrupts the electricity.\n\nEnding: The hum is defeated or tamed, but there's a sense of lingering danger. \"Yet still the tunnels thrum and vibrate— / Beware, the third rail’s hum waits still,\"\n\nNeed to check the meter. Let me count syllables. For example:\n\n\"Beware the Snicker-Snack’s sharp bite, (10)\nThe frumious hum that gnaws the night— (11)\" Hmm, maybe adjust to match more closely. Carroll's meter is a bit inconsistent but generally iambic tetrameter. Let me see:\n\nOriginal lines:\n'Twas brillig and the slithy toves (8)\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe: (9)\nAll mimsy were the borogoves, (8)\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe. (8)\n\nSo some variation but mostly 8 syllables. My lines are a bit long. Let me tighten:\n\n\"Beware the Snicker-Snack's bite, (8)\nThe frumious hum that gnaws night— (9)\" Maybe acceptable.\n\nOverall, the poem should have the whimsical, playful language, invented words, a narrative arc, and the third rail as a central element with its creature and challenges. Make sure each stanza contributes to the story and builds the fantastical world.\n</think>\n\n**The Frumious Third Rail's Hum**  \n\nBeware the Snicker-Snack’s sharp bite,  \nThe frumious hum that gnaws the night—  \nA zing of death, a spark of spite,  \nWhere VDUs prowl, void of light.  \n\nTake warning as you wend the deep,  \nWhere glowspires sing in gloom asleep,  \nNor tangle with the Flish that flibulux,  \nLest volts in wrath your soul bewray.  \n\nHe chanced upon the live rail’s lair,  \nWhere Zhisser’s song did sizzle, flare—  \nA thrum that bends both bone and air,  \nAnd fries the wits of those who dare.  \n\n“Arise!” the courage-kin did shout,  \nAs near he crept with wary rout,  \nThe Hum-wyrm coiled, a livid rout—  \nIts fangs agleam with stolen volt.  \n\nHe drew the Quizzlerod of old,  \nTo quell the spark that time had stole,  \nAnd smote the beast with glimmering hold,  \nTill crackling dark its wrath did mold.  \n\nYet still the tunnels thrum and vibrate—  \nBeware, the third rail’s hum waits still,  \nAnd should your footstep falter late,  \nThe Snicker’s bite outsnicks the frill.", "info": {"topic": "third rail hum"}, "reward": 0.8421052631578947, "label": "high", "criteria_yes": 16, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.8421052631578947, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "model_id": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "model_slug": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1"}
{"i": 49, "prompt": "Write a poem about film camera in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem. Keep a playful ballad cadence with some rhyme. Add an admonition or preparation and a celebratory return. Use some invented words.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about a film camera in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Let me recall what that entails. Carroll's poem uses nonsense words, playful language, and a ballad meter. So, I'll need to invent some terms related to photography and film.\n\nFirst, the title should be catchy with a made-up word. Maybe \"Bricolage & The Lens That Purrs\"? Bricolage has a rhythmic feel and hints at the mechanical aspects. \n\nNext, the structure. Jabberwocky has quatrains with an ABCB rhyme scheme. I'll follow that. The first stanza needs an admonition. \"Beware the Shutter’s vorpal snicker-snap\" introduces urgency and a nonsense word \"vorpal\".\n\nThen, setting the scene. Describe the camera’s parts with invented terms: \"frumious bellows\", \"gyre of gears\". Mention film as \"glamoured spool\" to add mystique. \n\nThe action sequence: loading film, waiting for the shot. \"galumphing light\" and \"mimsy moment\" keep the playful tone. \n\nThe climax: taking the photo. Use \"clicker-clack\" and \"stoat\" as a whimsical creature. \n\nThe return home with a celebratory tone, mentioning developing the film with \"gamboge dark\" and \"acid bath\". End with a toast to the process, using \"chutteringuby\" as a fun drink. \n\nCheck the meter and rhyme. Ensure each line has the right syllable count and the invented words fit naturally. Make sure the ballad cadence is consistent and playful. Add the adornment and celebratory elements as required. Let me piece it together and review for flow and adherence to the style.\n</think>\n\n**Bricolage & The Lens That Purrs**  \n*Beware the Shutter’s vorpal snicker-snap,*  \n*The frumious bellows, the gyre of gears—*  \n*By dawn’s first glimmer, take heed, clap-trap!*  \n*The film, a glamoured spool, appears!*  \n\n*‘Tis brillig, smart—grab your heliotrope,*  \n*To chase the sun’s galumphing gleam.*  \n* Kemp through the vales where the motes do hope*  \n*To freeze a mimsy visage in a dream.*  \n\n*“Beware the Shutter that purrs like cream!”*  \n*The gnomes all warn, with a titter-wit,*  \n*“Lest it outgrabe your shot’s last esteem—*  \n*One snicker-snap and you’ll flout the lit!”*  \n\n*I dashed to the glade where the f-stops play,*  \n*My corben-claro in ready hand,*  \n*And caught a stoat (all frabjul and fray)*  \n*In mome-clickers that crickled the land.*  \n\n*“O frumious lens, thou hast grappled well!”*  \n*I chortled,Near the gamboge dark of the vault,*  \n*Where nimsy fumes (all zing and zanthell)*  \n*Dance in the acid bath’s burble-waltz.*  \n\n*Now, hand in hand with the snicker’s thrall,*  \n*I’ll trog to the lode where the fixer flows—*  \n*No vorpal duds nor mome’s retreating call*  \n*Shall outflumplax this chutteringuby’s toast!  \n*Huzzah, my blurbs!
