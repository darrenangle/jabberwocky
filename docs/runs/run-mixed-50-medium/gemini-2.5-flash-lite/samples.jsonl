no confrontation stanza with named creature or foe; instead protagonist selects path and ventures forth.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>No decisive slaying or resolution of central tension; no combat or clear climactic action described.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return with celebration: fourth stanza depicts protagonist coming back “with a shout… eyes with gladness bright,” laying down treasure; a kind of jubilant acknowledgment and homecoming implied.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count moderate but not high; coined words include slithermere, gringle-gorge, glumping, snickering (though snickering is standard English in modified form), flumphing, fribbling, grish, mizzled, wamble-ways, slumberpath; about 8+ invented forms or highly unusual compound coinages likely counted.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one invented word (slithermere, gringle-gorge, glumping, snickering spoon, flumphing stew, fribbling feast, grish, mizzled bent, wamble-ways, slumberpath’s bloom) so coinages spread across stanzas.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>No specific named non-canonical creature/entity central to action; “slithermere” is a place or vague entity, “gringle-gorge” also place/feature, no named foe or creature encountered or named as adversary.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>No onomatopoeia bursts like ‘snicker-snack’ or ‘Pop!’ detected; no exclamatory sound imitations.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Some mild alliteration/consonance observed: e.g., “shadows lie,” “twists and turns,” “brambles sharp and keen,” but not strongly prominent nor clearly in ≥2 stanzas with overt stylized alliteration.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Tone is whimsical and playful with mythic flavor, e.g., “wondrous sight is seen,” “bloom of your desire,” “artery heaven-sent,” consistent with Carroll-like tone.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines exactly match canonical poem lines; all original wording.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens like “brillig,” “slithy,” “vorpal,” etc. mostly absent; canonical words appear only in the form “slithermere” (coinage) or referencing “my son,” “beware” common but not canonical tokens; canonical token usage within limit ≤8.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts approximate Jabberwocky pattern in many stanzas; longer lines mostly 8–9 syllables, shorter lines 5–7; e.g. stanza 1 lines count roughly: 10,7,7,7; stanza 2: ~9,8,8,7; fairly close to desired syllabic tightness in ≥60% of stanzas.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme words differ across stanzas (sigh/lie, stew/grew, plea/free/keen/seen, bright/light); no end word repeated >2 times; variety sufficient.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No overuse of single content words beyond 5 times or 8% threshold; vocabulary moderately spread and no obvious repetition abuse.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages have variety; roots different (slithermere, gringle, glumping, snickering?, flumphing, fribbling, grish, mizzled, wamble); distinct roots >4; no single suffix dominates >50%.</C22_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>"}
