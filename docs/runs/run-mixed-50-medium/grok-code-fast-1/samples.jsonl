Its grinways so aglow,\nIts wrinkly wollows, skoogle-hoed, beware its deadly blow!\n\nThe Frumpletoad is lurchemaw, with gloops upon its flank;\nIts bembers buzz like zumbly drones, around the tangled bank.\nOne, two! One, two! It galumphs along the desire's snitch:\nIt quoggles left, then right again, defying logic's hitch.\n\n“And hast thou slain the Frumpletoad? Come to my arms, my beamish boy!\nO frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!” He chortled in his glee.\nAnd through the wood it twisted back, the path of secret yen,\nWhile wanderers pause to wonder why the Frumpletoad has been.\n\nFor wishers weave their wicked ways, on trails untrod and true,\nWhere roots besnark the hasty heel, and thorns do vellichue.\nBeware the Frumpletoad's return! Its eyes like glowing runes,\nIts bumbleworts and gizzy grins, beneath the waning loons.\n\n“So rest thee by the frozzen oak,” the father says nearby:\n“No frapples here to skibble thee, nor verdle in the rye.”\nBut oh!
