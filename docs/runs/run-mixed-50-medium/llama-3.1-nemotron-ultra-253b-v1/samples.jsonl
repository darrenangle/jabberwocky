{"i": 0, "prompt": "Write a poem about underpass echo in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem. Use a few invented coinages and a named creature. Avoid copying lines from the original.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about underpass echo in the style of \"Jabberwocky\" with a title, some invented coinages, and a named creature. Let me start by recalling the original \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll. It's known for its nonsense words, playful language, and whimsical creatures. So I need to capture that essence but focus on an underpass echo.\n\nFirst, the title should be catchy and have a similar alliteration to \"Jabberwocky.\" Maybe something like \"Underpass Umberwyrm\" to incorporate the setting and a creature name. The creature, Umberwyrm, sounds mysterious and fits the underpass environment.\n\nNow, the structure: \"Jabberwocky\" has a consistent rhyme scheme and meter, mostly quatrains with an AABB pattern. I'll stick to that. The first stanza should introduce the underpass and the time, maybe twilight when echoes are noticeable.\n\nFor the creature, the Umberwyrm, it should inhabit the underpass. Maybe it's made of shadows or sound. I need to invent some actions for it, like \"glibble\" and \"glum\" to describe its movements. The echo itself can be personified as something that \"murmle\" and \"squelch,\" using coinages here.\n\nThe next stanza needs a narrator's warning, similar to \"Beware the Jabberwock.\" Phrases like \"Shun the gloam\" and \"frumious hum\" can create that eerie feeling. The underpass environment should have elements like \"squelch-wumps\" and \"jingle-placks\" to mimic the original's nonsense words.\n\nThen, the encounter with the Umberwyrm. The protagonist might use a \"sonicickle\" as a weapon, which plays on \"icicle\" and \"sonic\" for sound. The battle should be lively with made-up verbs like \"glibble\" and \"jinkle.\" The echo's reaction can involve \"murmle\" and \"thrum,\" emphasizing sound effects.\n\nThe climax where the echo is defeated needs a dramatic line, maybe shattering into \"shiverjaws\" and fading into \"thimble-silence.\" Ending with the protagonist escaping as the underpass returns to normal, but with a lingering hum, wraps it up neatly.\n\nLet me check the coinages: glibble, glum, murmle, squelch-wumps, jingle-placks, frumious, sonicickle, jinkle, shiverjaws, thimble-silence. These should be unique and fit the style. The creature Umberwyrm is named and integral to the plot. I think this meets the user's request without copying any original lines. Time to put it all together with the title and structure matching \"Jabberwock\" but staying original.\n</think>\n\n**Underpass Umberwyrm**  \n\nBeware the glimmergloop’s soft sigh  \nWhen twilight slinks through concrete skies,  \nThe underpass, all damp and grey,  \nWhere echoes breed and never stray.  \n\nBeware the Umberwyrm that glibbles deep,  \nA shadow-thing in asphalt keep,  \nWith maw agape and eyes of hum,  \nIt slurps the sound that you become.  \n\n“Shun the gloam where murmling creeps,  \nAnd fleers of froth from driveways leap!  \nBeware the jingle-placks’ sly song—  \nThey’ll thrumble you where’er you throng!”  \n\nI grasped a sonicickle keen,  \nTo vanquish that subsonic sheen,  \nWhen—SNICK—the umberwyrm did glide,  \nIts glibble-teeth all clack’midxide.  \n\n“Frumious hum!” the beast did blare,  \nAs squelch-wumps pulsed the stagnant air.  \nI jinkled left, I jowled right,  \nTill thimble-silence drowned the fight.  \n\nNow out I fled, the underpass  \nStill throbs with that mimsy mass—  \nYet what I slew, I’ll ne’er define…  \nWas it the wyrm, or just the whine?", "info": {"topic": "underpass echo"}, "reward": 0.8421052631578947, "label": "high", "criteria_yes": 16, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.8421052631578947, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}}

Add an admonition or preparation and a celebratory return. Use some invented words.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this request. The user wants a poem about morning fog in the style of \"Jabberwocky\". First, I need to recall what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It's got a playful ballad rhythm, lots of invented words, and a whimsical yet adventurous tone.\n\nSo the title should be catchy and a bit nonsensical, maybe using alliteration. \"The Fog-Born Frumious Floop\" – Frumious is from the original poem, and Floop adds a playful twist. \n\nNow, the structure. Quatrains with an ABCB rhyme scheme, maybe alternating eight and four syllables? Let me check the original. Yeah, Carroll uses that structure. So I'll stick to that.\n\nFirst stanza: set the scene. Morning fog creeping in. Use some invented verbs like \"flibuljibits\" to mimic Carroll's style. Maybe warn the reader to be cautious, as the fog has dangers. \"Beware the mome raths\" reference, but make it fog-related. \n\nSecond stanza: describe the fog's appearance. \"Wizzle whim wham\" sounds like a whimsical term for the fog's movement. Mention hidden creatures, like \"jinklewiffs\" and \"snickADOWs\" – those names should be fantastical. \n\nIntroduce a creature to avoid, like \"glurblooms\" and \"rophic tizz\" – maybe they sting or trick. The protagonist needs to navigate through, perhaps with a \"vorpal blade\" equivalent, but maybe a \"gloopernaught\" as a tool. \n\nThen the fog clears, the danger passes, and there's a triumphant return. Celebrate with a feast, using playful words like \"brumplenooks\" and \"flumplenux\". End with the adventurer home safe, ready to tell tales. \n\nMake sure each stanza flows into the next, maintaining the ballad cadence. Check the meter to ensure it's lively and playful. Use alliteration where possible to enhance the musicality. Finally, ensure the invented words fit naturally and add to the poem's joy and adventure without being too obscure.\n</think>\n\nThe Fog-Born Frumious Floop  \n\nBeware the mome mists that flibuljibit by,  \nBrewed in the snozzle of dawn’s dewy sigh,  \nWhen frothy fizzlethumps dance, wumplen and wide,  \nAnd glims of glazzle gleam, gilded with glee inside.  \n\nTread softly, my dear, through the namby-wam wade,  \nLest wizzlewhim whams wumplenux ’cross your shade,  \nFor jinklewiffs jive in the phlizzlethorn pelt,  \nAnd snickADOWs snicker where snicker-snarks melt.  \n\nOh, the glurblooms!

Let me start by recalling the original's features. \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll uses nonsense words that sound meaningful, a strong rhythm, and a playful yet mysterious tone. The structure is quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme.\n\nFirst, I need a title that echoes \"Jabberwocky\" but relates to déjà vu. Maybe something like \"Déjàvocky\" to blend the two. Next, coined words. The original has \"slithy\", \"mome\", \"galumphing\". I should invent similar terms. Words like \"flumplenax\" (a creature?), \"snicker-snatch\" (an action?), \"flibulous\" (describing something). \n\nThe poem needs a narrative. \"Jabberwocky\" tells of a battle with a monster. For déjà vu, maybe a journey where the protagonist encounters a creature that embodies the feeling. The \"Mnemonic Wraithe\" could be the named creature, symbolizing recurring memories.\n\nRhyme and meter are crucial. Iambic tetrameter, four beats per line. Let me check syllable counts. Each line should flow smoothly with made-up words fitting the rhythm. \n\nFirst stanza: Introduce the setting and the mission. \"Beware the Mnemonic Wraithe\" mirrors \"Beware the Jabberwock\". The \"flumplenax shadows\" create a mysterious environment. Mentioning \"memory's maze\" ties to déjà vu's theme of familiarity.\n\nSecond stanza: Action with the creature. \"Snicker-snatch\" as a verb, \"glibloom seeds\" as something scattered. The Wraithe's approach with \"frabjulon sighs\" adds to the atmosphere.\n\nThird stanza: Build tension. \"Flibulous\", \"glintzen\" for bubbly light effects. The \"chronous\" loop references time, fitting déjà vu's time distortion.\n\nFourth stanza: Climax with the battle. \"Vuv(settings)\" and \"jinx the déjà's sting\" show overcoming the feeling. The \"mnemon's might\" uses memory to defeat the Wraithe.\n\nFifth stanza: Resolution. \"Waltz through time's repeat\" suggests acceptance. \"Fuzzle\" for fading, leaving the experience behind.\n\nCheck for invented words and consistency. Ensure each stanza follows the rhyme scheme and meter. Avoid direct lines from \"Jabberwocky\" but mimic its style. The creature \"Mnemonic Wraithe\" is central, and terms like \"flumplenax\" fit the nonsense vocabulary.

Something like \"Beware the Snicker-Snack\" but tailored to the desire path theme.\n\nThen a celebratory return. The poem should end on a positive note, celebrating the journey taken. Using words that evoke joy and accomplishment.\n\nInvented words are necessary. Think of terms that sound plausible but aren't real. Maybe \"flumplenooks\" for obstacles, \"fizzlethorns\" for challenges, \"wuggle\" as a verb. These should fit the rhythm and rhyme.\n\nImagery is important. Desire paths are those shortcuts people take, often through grass or dirt, instead of the laid-out paths. Highlighting the contrast between the planned path and the organic, winding desire path.\n\nPlayful language and rhyme. Use alliteration and assonance to keep the poem flowing. Maybe some internal rhymes as well.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nStart with the warning, introduce the desire path, describe the journey with invented obstacles, the act of taking the path, and the triumphant return.\n\nCheck for rhyme scheme and meter. Each line should be roughly iambic tetrameter, similar to the original.\n\nTest lines for flow.

He uses nonsense words, playful language, and a rhythmic, lyrical structure. The original has creatures like the Jabberwock, so I need to invent a similar-sounding creature and some coinages.\n\nFirst, the title. Maybe something that sounds grand and absurd, like \"The Vorpal Meeting\" or \"The Frumious Conference.\" \"The Frumious Conference\" has that Carroll-esque ring. \n\nNow, the setting: a conference room. Think about elements like tables, whiteboards, projectors, endless meetings. Need to Jabberwockify these. \"Frumious\" could describe the conference itself, combining \"fuming\" and \"curious.\" \n\nInvented coinages: \"Qwurled\" for the agenda, \"galumph\" as a verb maybe. The creature needs a name, like \"Bandersnatch\" from the original. Maybe \"Snicker-Snitch\" or \"Burble-Beast.\" Let's go with \"Burble-Beast\" to represent the meeting's chaos.\n\nStructure-wise, quatrains with AABB rhyme scheme.

Add an admonition or preparation and a celebratory return. Use some invented words.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about a music room in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Let me break this down. First, I need to recall the characteristics of 'Jabberwocky'. It's known for its neologisms, playful language, and whimsical creatures, all while maintaining a ballad rhythm with rhyme scheme and meter.\n\nSo, the title should be catchy and have that nonsense feel. Maybe something like \"The Mimsy Melodeon's Lilt\"? \"Mimsy\" is from the original poem, and \"Melodeon\" is an old-fashioned musical instrument. That fits.\n\nNext, the structure. 'Jabberwocky' has quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme and iambic tetrameter. I'll need to stick to that. The user mentioned an admonition or preparation and a celebratory return. Let me outline the flow: introduce the music room with wonder, warn about the challenges (like the \"Jabberwock\" had dangers), then triumph over them with music.\n\nInvented words are crucial here. Words like \"snicker-snack\" from the original can inspire new terms. Maybe \"flumplenooks\" for obstacles, \"glibblejaws\" for something mischievous, \"gallimaufry\" for a mix of sounds, and \"mellwhen\" as a verb related to music.\n\nFor the admonition, I'll create a sense of danger in the music room. Perhaps personifying musical challenges as beasts. Then, the celebration comes from overcoming them with the power of music.\n\nNeed to ensure playful cadence. Using alliteration and internal rhymes will help, like \"whiffling echoes\" or \"gallant gallimaufry\". The refrain \"mimsy melodeon's lilt\" can tie the poem together.\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme. Each stanza should alternate rhymes. Let me test a couple lines: \"With spoons that clink and a frumious fiddle, / Beware the feep that fouls the tune!\" Yes, \"fiddle\" and \"tune\" rhyme, but wait, the second and fourth lines need to rhyme. So maybe adjust the second line's end.\n\nAlso, include interactive elements, like urging the reader to join in, to make it engaging. End with a triumphant return, celebrating the music's victory over challenges.\n\nLet me draft a stanza:\n\n\"'Tis brillig here where the wild whim whistles,\nAnd whiffling echoes sing a tune, librarian.\nWith spoons that clink and a frumious fiddle,\nBeware the feep that fouls the tune!\"\n\nHmm, \"whistles\" and \"fiddle\" don't rhyme. Maybe change \"whistles\" to \"whims\" to rhyme with \"fiddle\"? Not perfect. Alternatively, adjust the second line.

Maybe \"The Burnwicck's Lament\" or something similar with a possessive apostrophe to mimic the style.\n\nScreen burn-in refers to a ghostly image lingering on a screen.

It's full of nonsense words that sound meaningful, a playful rhythm, and a whimsical yet adventurous tone. So, I need to capture that essence but focus on stage wings.\n\nFirst, the title. \"Jabberwocky\" has a whimsical, alliterative title. Maybe something like \"Winglets of Whimsy-Wrack\"? \"Whimsy-Wrack\" sounds like a made-up place, similar to \"Tulgey Woods\". \n\nNext, the structure. The original has four-line stanzas with a consistent rhyme scheme, usually ABAB. I'll stick to that. Each stanza should tell part of a story, with some action and vivid imagery.\n\nNow, stage wings. They're the sides of the stage where actors wait. I need to personify them or make them part of a fantastical world. Maybe the wings are alive or have magical properties. The user wants a few invented coinages, so I'll create some words. \"Flumplenooks\" could be the creature mentioned, perhaps something that hides in the wings. \"Snicker-snee\" is from the original, but I should avoid copying, so maybe \"glibbleglow\" for the lights. \n\nThe poem needs a narrative. Let's have a protagonist navigating the stage wings, encountering fantastical creatures and overcoming challenges. The \"Jabberwock\" is a fearsome beast; our version could have the \"Mimsy Maw\" or \"F umplenooks\". \n\nInvented words: \"Whiffling\" (from the original) might be okay, but I need new ones. \"Jinklewiffs\" for the curtains? \"Gallimaufry\" means a dish of leftovers, but can be used to describe a mix of things. \"Splendiferous\" for splendid. \n\nRhyming and meter: Each line should be roughly iambic tetrameter. Let me check syllable counts. For example:\n\n\"Beware the Flumplenooks that creep\nWhere winglets whisper, dark and deep,\nTheir glibbleglow eyes agleam—\nA spectral show, a thespian dream.\"\n\nThat's four lines, ABAB rhyme, and flows like the original. The creature is named, and there's an invented word \"glibbleglow\". \n\nNext stanza: Maybe the protagonist takes action. \"He grasped the Snazzlepuff by thimbles...\" Snazzlepuff could be a prop, \"thimbles\" for fingers. \n\nInclude some stage elements: spotlights, curtains, stage fright. \"Forsooth!\" as an exclamation. The climax where the protagonist conquers the challenge: \"He soused the Mimsy Maw with Gleezle’s might\". \"Gleezle\" could be a magical essence. \n\nEnding with the stage going quiet, the show ends. \"The Winglets sighed their last ‘twixt gleam and gloom\". \n\nCheck for copied lines: I think it's safe. Now, review for the right style, invented words, creature name, and theme of stage wings. Looks good. Time to put it all together with the title.\n</think>\n\n**Winglets of Whimsy-Wrack**  \n\nBeware the Flumplenooks that creep  \nWhere winglets whisper, dark and deep,  \nTheir glibbleglow eyes agleam—  \nA spectral show, a thespian dream.  \n\n‘Tis brillig on the boards so bright,  \nThe Jinklewiffs clutch scripts too tight,  \n\"Flee stage-fright’s frothy fume!\" they cry,  \nAs spotlights yawn with gobbledy sigh.  \n\nHe seized the Snazzlepuff by thimbles bold,  \n\"Fie on your fizzled faux-retro gold!\"  \nForsooth!

In 'Jabberwocky', the father warns the son about the Jabberwock. Here, the warning could be about the dangers of burning the butter. Need to invent some words here.

That alliteration fits the style. Next, invent some creatures and coinages. The original has \"Jabberwock,\" \"Bandersnatch,\" so I should create similar-sounding names. Let's see... \"flibloom seeds\" could be something whimsical.

Carroll uses nonsense words, playful language, a ballad rhythm, and a structure that tells a story with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The poem also has a sense of adventure and danger, with an admonition and a triumphant return.\n\nFirst, the title. \"Jabberwocky\" has a whimsical, made-up title that suggests the fantastical content.

{"i": 16, "prompt": "Write a poem about umbrella in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem. Use a few invented coinages and a named creature. Avoid copying lines from the original.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about an umbrella in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Let me recall that 'Jabberwocky' by Lewis Carroll is known for its whimsical language, made-up words, and playful rhythm, usually with a consistent meter and rhyme scheme. The poem often features fantastical creatures and nonsense verses that still convey vivid imagery.\n\nFirst, I need to invent a title that sounds Jabberwocky-esque. Maybe something like \"The Snicker-Snack Shade\" or \"Brella's Frumious Flight\". Wait, \"The Snicker-Snack Shade\" has a nice ring to it, incorporating \"snicker-snack\" which is a term from the original poem.\n\nNext, I need to include a named creature. The original has the Jabberwock, so perhaps I can create something like \"gallewumpus\" or \"flumplenax\". Let's go with \"Gallewumpus\" and maybe another one like \"snickerwraith\". These names should be fantastical and fit the rhythm.\n\nThe umbrella is the main subject. I should personify it or make it an active element in the narrative. Maybe the umbrella is a tool to battle the weather creatures. So, the protagonist uses the umbrella against these beasts.\n\nNow, coinages are important. Words like \"galumphing\" from the original. Let me think of verbs and nouns: \"flibuljibits\", \"whiffling\", \"jinklewiff\", \"snicker-snack\" (already used in title), \"glibbleglorp\". These should be sprinkled throughout the verses to maintain the whimsy.\n\nStructure-wise, 'Jabberwocky' has four-line stanzas with an ABAB rhyme scheme. Each line is about eight syllables, with a trochaic meter. I need to match that as closely as possible.\n\nStarting the first stanza with setting the scene: \"Beware the feralsnarl, my son! / The flibuljibits bite; / Beware the gallewumpus when / The cloudsongs drown the light.\" Feralsnarl could be a weather-related creature, and cloudsongs to describe the storm.\n\nIntroducing the umbrella: \"Take the jinklewiff-handled brolly— / 'Twill thwart the snickerwraith— / Its canopy, a shimmerlure, / To tame the tempest's wrath.\" Jinklewiff for the handle, brolly as a slang for umbrella. Shimmerlure gives it a magical feel.\n\nAction sequence: \"The thunderboars came whiffling, all / Glibbleglorp and grey; / He twirled the snazzy umbra-sword, / Splishy-splashy fray!\" Thunderboars as storm creatures, whiffling and glibbleglorp as actions or descriptors. Umbra-sword makes the umbrella a weapon.\n\nClimax: \"Jubjub's lightning forked hellfire— / 'Twas grim, that snatheful day!— / He parried with a flick and—Oh! / The gallewumpus slayed!\" Incorporating hellfire, snatheful (a mix of snathe and awful?), and defeating the creature.\n\nEnding with the umbrella's victory and the aftermath: \"Now Mum's proud of his flazzlepox, / All bedabbled still, / Though puddings lithesome leap and laugh— / He holds the snicker-snack's thrill.\" Flazzlepox might describe his wounds or medals, bedabbled as wet, puddings lithesome as playful puddles.\n\nNeed to check the meter and rhyme scheme. Read each stanza aloud to ensure the rhythm matches. Adjust any lines that stumble. Make sure the invented words are sprinkled but not overwhelming, and the umbrella is glorified as the hero's tool.\n\nLastly, the title should be at the top, capitalized and centered if possible, but since the output is just the poem, ensure it's properly titled. Avoid any direct lines from the original, so no \"vorpal blade\" or \"mane of flames\". Everything should be original but in the same vein.\n\nLooks like all elements are covered: title, style, invented words, named creature, umbrella as the subject, and the structure matches.

That sets the scene with a playful twist. Next, the opening lines should introduce the setting, maybe morning, and a call to action. \"Beware the Hypotheen\" mirrors \"Beware the Jabberwock\" and introduces an invented word related to science—maybe hypothesis with a twist.\n\nThen, the narrator's journey: leaving home, heading to the fair. Using words like \"whiffling\" and \"floopenmoor\" adds that whimsical feel. The science fair itself needs elements like volcanoes, robots, and slime. Incorporating alliteration and invented terms here will help, like \"frothling\" for baking soda volcanoes and \"sproing\" for robot arms.\n\nThe challenge or conflict could be a rival project, maybe something with lasers and mirrors. Words like \"Zingpocket\" and \"fizzle frazzle\" create that playful tension. Then, the climax where the experiment works, using words like \"flarp\" and \"jinkle\" to describe the reaction.\n\nThe return home should be celebratory with a trophy, using phrases like \"galumphing\" and \"frabjulit\" to match the original's joyful ending.

Avoid copying lines from the original.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about a film camera in the style of \"Jabberwocky,\" so I need to recall that style. Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\" uses made-up words, playful language, and a whimsical, slightly nonsense feel with a rhythmic meter. The poem also features a mythical creature, like the Jabberwock. \n\nFirst, the title. Maybe something like \"The Snickering Shutterwock\" to rhyme with Jabberwock and incorporate camera elements. The creature should have a name related to photography. \"Shutterwock\" combines shutter and Jabberwock.\n\nNext, the structure. Quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme, similar to the original. I need to invent some coinages. Words like \"filmsy,\" \"sprocketeer,\" \"exposules,\" \"developix,\" \"fixliate,\" \"darkslide,\" \"envelophase.\" These should sound technical but whimsical.\n\nIncluding camera-related actions: loading film, shutter clicks, developing, fixing. The creature's traits should involve photographic processes. Maybe the Shutterwock attacks with \"framerate\" claws or \"f-stop\" maw. The battle involves taking photos, using film as a weapon.\n\nThe ending needs a resolution. The protagonist defeats the Shutterwock by using the camera's flash, capturing its essence. Then they develop the film, preserving the memory. The closing line should mirror \"Jabberwocky,\" like \"and the Shutterwock’s sharp shriek grew still.\"\n\nCheck for original lines from \"Jabberwocky\" to avoid. Ensure the invented words fit the rhythm. Test the meter—each line should be roughly iambic tetrameter. Read aloud to check flow. Adjust any forced rhymes or awkward phrases.

Add an admonition or preparation and a celebratory return. Use some invented words.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about a printer jam in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Let me start by recalling the characteristics of that poem. 'Jabberwocky' by Lewis Carroll uses nonsense words, playful language, and a whimsical yet adventurous tone, often with a clear rhyme scheme and structure.\n\nFirst, I need to capture the essence of a printer jam but make it fantastical. The original poem has a battle theme, so maybe liken the jam to a monster or a foe. The user mentioned an admonition or preparation and a celebratory return, so the structure should have those elements.\n\nThe title should be catchy and have alliteration, like \"The Frumious Jam-malarky\". \"Frumious\" is a Carrollian term, blending \"fuming\" and \"furious\", which fits the frustration of a jam. \"Jam-malarky\" combines jam with \"falcon\" maybe, or just a made-up word.\n\nNext, the opening stanza needs to set the scene. Something about the printer lying in wait, using invented words. Maybe \"Burble\" for the sound the printer makes, and \"flarp\" as a verb. The protagonist is warned by a figure, like the \"Mome of IT\", adding a playful character.\n\nFor the battle scene, the jam is personified as a \"Bandersnatch of paper\" with \"glibbage\" and \"flazzle\". The fight involves using tools like the \"vorpal Staple-o'matic\", which sounds whimsical and effective. The resolution should involve tearing free the jam, leading to a victory cry.\n\nThe celebratory return should involve things working smoothly again, with the printer now docile. Including words like \"glinten\" and \"mimsy\" ties back to Carroll's style. Ending with a warning to others to be cautious, using \"beware\" and a playful closing line.\n\nI need to check the rhyme scheme. 'Jabberwocky' uses ABAB, so each stanza should follow that. Invented words need to be sprinkled in without overcomplicating. Keep the rhythm bouncy and light, maintaining the ballad feel. Make sure the admonition is clear (beware the jam) and the celebration is triumphant.\n\nLet me piece it together step by step, ensuring each part flows and the playful language is consistent. Read through each line to test the cadence and rhyme, adjusting where necessary. Finally, ensure the title stands out and the entire poem meets the user's requirements without markdown.\n</think>\n\n**The Frumious Jam-malarky**  \n\n\"Beware the glarp that gripes the feed,  \nThe burble-frump with flarping creed!  \nBeware the Mome of IT who’ll chide—  \n_‘Two reams to go till shutdown tide!’_  \n\nHe took the vorpal Staple-o’matic in hand:  \nLong time the printheads glinted, jam-possessed,  \nWhile trailed in dead the bandersnatch of paper bland,  \nAll glibbage, flazzle, and increasingly depressed.  \n\n‘Twas brillig, and the slates chewed through their load,  \nA mimsy LED did gyre and wamble:  \nAll maws achoke with crumply fold on fold—  \n_‘Oh frabjous flop!’_ the user cried, _‘Oh scamble!’_  \n\nHe plunged the glinten blade with yoop of zeal,  \nThen *ripped* the snarl (oh *splexing* sound!) and tore  \nThe glorphe from gears with yells of gleeful squall—  \n‘_Frumious win!_ The jam-malarky’s no more!’  \n\nNow frabulax flows free, the tubes respire,  \nThe mome Temporary Files churn merrily:  \nAnd all the while, a calm shelf holds the Grimoire…  \n_‘Beware the glarp,’_ the manual whispers, _‘Beware… and inkle thee.’_  \n\nSo raise the mouse, allihar Joyce and cheer!  \nThe byte-wock sleeps.

Something like \"The Jollyrella's Plunge\" or \"Brollywack's Frolic\"? Hmm, \"Brolly\" is slang for umbrella, so maybe \"Brollywack\" could be a creature. Let's go with \"The Jollyrella's Plunge\" as the title.\n\nNow, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. Each stanza introduces a fantastical element. I need to do the same. Start with setting the scene: a rainy day. Use words like \"gallimaufry\" to mean a mixture, maybe \"flumplenooks\" for raindrops. \n\nIn the first stanza, mention the umbrella's slumber. Then, introduce a creature, like \"mimsy flargles\" or \"slinkerpaws.\" Maybe a \"Glibblejaws\" that threatens the umbrella. The umbrella needs to take action, so it opens with a \"Flish!\" sound. \n\nInclude some action where the umbrella confronts the creature. Use words like \"twizzlewhack\" and \"glorple\" to describe movements. Add a moral or a whimsical ending, like \"Beware the Jollyrella's whimsy spin / That frolicks forth when skies grow grim.\" \n\nCheck for made-up words, keep the rhythm similar to the original, and ensure each stanza flows.

Monte Carlo is luxurious, associated with casinos, the sea, and maybe some mythical elements. I should invent some creatures or terms that evoke that atmosphere. Words like \"glitzwings\" for the seagulls, \"roulette's whirlIncremer\" to mix roulette with a fantastical machine.\n\nThe structure should follow quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. Each stanza needs to build the scene, introduce a challenge (the gamble), an admonition, and a triumphant return. \n\nThe admonition part is important. In \"Jabberwocky\", the mother warns the protagonist. Here, maybe the \"gambler\" warns about the dangers of the casino, using invented terms like \"Flibloomjibits\" and \"Borogrooves\". \n\nThen the journey into Monte Carlo, the gaming, and the climax where the protagonist wins, using words like \"flumplenax\" to describe the victory. The return should be celebratory, with made-up words like \"jubjaws\" and \"frumious loot\". \n\nNeed to check the rhythm, make sure it's playful and maintains the ballad cadence.

Let's outline the flow: introduce the camera, the process of taking a photo, some challenges, and then the joy of capturing the moment.\n\nInvented words are crucial here. Let me think of some. \"Snicker-snap\" for the shutter sound, \"flickerflame\" for the flash, \"glitzenbloom\" for the image, \"whirlytwirl\" for the film advancing. Maybe \"mistyveil\" for the uncertainty before development. Need to make sure these words hint at their meaning through context.\n\nAdmonition part: Maybe warn about missing the shot if not prepared. \"Beware the Mistyveil...\" Then the preparation, like loading the film, setting up. The celebratory return would be the joy of getting the perfect shot, the \"glitzenbloom\" appearing.\n\nNeed to maintain the ballad rhythm, so iambic tetrameter. Check each line's syllable count. Let's draft a stanza:\n\n'Beware the Flickerwock, my son!  \nThe jaws that bite, the flash that's sprung—  \nThe shutter's snicker-snap's undone  \nBy film that's frayed, or light that's stung.'\n\nHmm, \"Flickerwock\" as the playful name for the camera. Jaws that bite might refer to the camera's mechanism. \"Snicker-snap\" for the shutter. Challenges like frayed film or bad light.\n\nNext stanza about preparation. Maybe \"Take the Lens of Luminshade...\" Coined words here. Then instructions on how to shoot. \"Heed the whirlytwirl's soft chime\" refers to the film winding.\n\nAdmonition: \"Lest the moments, lost to time...\" emphasizes the importance of capturing the moment. Then the action of taking the photo: \"Pluck the shutter's silky thread...\" leading to the image being captured.\n\nCelebratory return: \"And lo! The Glitzenbloom... triumped in tones of hale and hues.\" The successful photograph. Ending with \"Shoot the Flickerwock with mirth!\" to encourage joyful photography.\n\nCheck rhyme scheme. Each stanza ABAB. Made-up words are sprinkled throughout. Playful and whimsical, meets the user's requirements. Let me put it all together and ensure the flow is smooth and the rhythm matches \"Jabberwocky.\"\n</think>\n\n**The Flickerwocky's Frame**  \n\nBeware the Flickerwock, my son!  \nThe jaws that bite, the flash that’s sprung—  \nThe shutter’s *snicker-snap*’s undone  \nBy film that’s frayed, or light that’s stung.  \n\nTake the Lens of Luminshade,  \nHeed the *whirlytwirl*’s soft chime,  \nLest the moments, lost to shade,  \nFade to grays of mistled time.  \n\nPluck the shutter’s silky thread,  \nWind the *flickerflame* with care,  \nLest the *glintzelawn* be lost, or red,  \nWhile the *pixlepox* leer there!  \n\nBut oh!

Avoid copying lines from the original.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about a music room in the style of \"Jabberwocky\". Let me recall that \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll is known for its nonsense words, playful language, and whimsical creatures. The key elements to capture here are the made-up words, a rhythmic meter similar to the original, and the inclusion of a named, fantastical creature.\n\nFirst, I need to come up with a title that evokes the same curiosity and whimsy. Maybe something like \"The Jinglywiff's Refrain\" – \"Jinglywiff\" sounds musical and fits the invented creature requirement. \n\nNow, the poem structure. \"Jabberwocky\" uses quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme and a trochaic tetrameter meter. I'll need to maintain that structure. Let's brainstorm some music-related nonsense terms. Words like \"flumplenooks\" could be the instruments, \"squelchalopes\" might describe sounds, and \"glorpalones\" for echoes. \n\nThe creature, the Jinglywiff, should be a guardian or inhabitant of the music room. It needs an action, like dancing or creating music. Maybe it's a playful guardian that brings the room to life. \n\nI should describe the room's elements: instruments coming alive, sounds swirling, maybe some magical effects. Incorporate verbs that mimic musical actions but with a twist, like \"twirl\" or \"chime\". \n\nAvoid any direct lines from the original, so no \"Beware the Jabberwock\" references. Instead, focus on unique imagery. Check that each stanza flows and the made-up words fit naturally into the rhythm. \n\nLet me draft the first stanza, setting the scene and introducing the Jinglywiff. Then move through the room's elements, building up the musical magic. Ensure the creature is integral to the scene, maybe leading the musical chaos. Finally, conclude with the music fading but the memory lingering, true to the whimsical feel of Carroll's work.\n\nRead through the draft to check meter and rhyme. Adjust any lines that stumble. Ensure the invented words add to the imagery without confusion. Make sure the creature's name is consistent and its role clear. Once satisfied, finalize the title and present the poem as requested.\n</think>\n\n**The Jinglywiff’s Refrain**  \n\nBeware the flumplenooks that twirl in spinny air,  \nThe squelchalopes that hum with zing and frabber-blast.  \nA glimmerwisp may snare your foot to tap and share  \nThe rhythmic thrums that Jinglywiffs forever cast.  \n\n‘Tis brillig in the hall where vinewaves softly chime,  \nThe glimmerchords all trembly, zithers prance and play.  \nSeek shadeflutes, not shade, to dodge the mute’s dull crime—  \n“Beware the Jinglywiff (and fetch my floopen-spray!”)  \n\nThe creature Jahr-Tick-Tock, a whirl of fiddlestick,  \nWith eight arms all a-tap on hollow loggletums,  \nIt jingles jingleplacks, it cracks the snicker-snack  \nTill glorpalones all shiver, Weeping Wobblydrums.  \n\n“O frabjazzlax, frivollers!” cried the maestro vain,  \nAs squibs of treble-squelch the basslines undertow.  \nThe Jinglywiff, a-twirl, its mane a-spoolin’ grain,  \nHowkmire’d all the flats and sharps to glow!

Phrases like \"Beware the Frumalax, my son!\" set the tone. Describing the stage wings as a place where strange things happen, with the creature lurking.\n\nIncluding actions with invented verbs: \"snickerwings snaffled\" suggests quick movements, \"glibblejaws\" as something to avoid.

Let me recall that \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll uses a lot of playful, invented language and has a rhythmic, ballad-like structure. So I need to mimic that style.\n\nFirst, I need to come up with a title. \"The Flibberflam Fry\" sounds whimsical and hints at the cooking process, maybe related to butter. That works.\n\nNow, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an ABCB rhyme scheme. I should follow that. Each stanza needs to have a playful cadence. Let's start with an admonition or preparation, as requested. Maybe warn the reader about the dangers of burning the butter. Use invented words here, like \"splink\" or \"floopjoy\". \n\n\"Beware the splink of froth\" – splink is a made-up word for the sound of bubbling butter. Then mention the \"floopjoy's hissy fray\" to describe the sizzling. Rhyme \"brown\" with \"frown\" to show the risk of overcooking.\n\nNext, the process of making brown butter. Use terms like \"melt the glub\" (glub as a noun for butter) and \"stir the rue\" (rue as a playful verb meaning stir). Add some alliteration: \"Simmer, slosh, and sloth\" – all S sounds for rhythm. Invent \"froth-fret\" to describe the foam forming.\n\nThen, the transformation. \"Flibberflam\" is a perfect nonsense word. Describe the butter changing: \"From cream to crunch, from pale to amber's kiss\". Use alliteration with \"crisp\" and \"curl\" to emphasize the texture.\n\nInclude the celebratory return. Maybe a feast scene with \"whiffling whoops\" and \"jiggly jam-jars\". \"Mallowfluff\" and \"sunbuttered toast\" as playful food terms. End with a toast to the brown butter, \"Gall Blair!\" as a cheers, maybe a nod to Carroll's \"Jabberwock\".\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme. Each stanza's last line rhymes with the second line. Keep the meter consistent, mostly iambic tetrameter. Use exclamation points and capitalization for emphasis, like Carroll did.\n\nMake sure to invent words that sound right but don't make the poem too obscure.

Let me recall that \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll is known for its nonsense words, playful language, and rhythmic ballad structure. So I need to invent some whimsical terms and maintain a similar cadence.\n\nFirst, the title should reflect both the layover theme and the whimsical style. Maybe \"The Layover Bay Ballad\" or something with alliteration. \"The Layover's Lazy Lilt\" – hmm, that has a nice ring.\n\nNext, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. I'll follow that. The first stanza should set the scene. Mention the bay as a place of pause between journeys. Use invented words like \"flumplenooks\" for whimsy. \n\nThe admonition part needs a warning. Maybe about not rushing, using terms like \"galumphing\" and \"squelch\". Then the preparation phase – what to do during the layover. Invented verbs like \"snickerfritz\" and \"flibbertigibbet\" could work here. \n\nFor the celebratory return, emphasize joy and resuming the journey. Words like \"chuffelumps\" and \"wizzlewhack\" add the playful touch. Ensure the rhythm is consistent, maybe iambic tetrameter. Check the meter for each line to match the original's flow. \n\nLet me draft a stanza and test the rhythm. \"In Layover Bay, where flumplenooks play, / Beware the rush and the frantic fray!\" Yes, that scans well. Continue with the warning against \"galumphing\" and the need to \"snickerfritz\" time away. \n\nInvented words should fit the context without being too obscure. \"Flish\" as a mix of float and swish. \"Jinklewiff\" for a joyful sound. The conclusion should loop back to the journey's renewal, tying the layover's end to a cheerful return. \n\nNow, assemble the lines, ensuring rhyme and rhythm.

Let me recall that \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll uses a lot of made-up words, playful language, and a rhythmic ballad structure. So first, I need to capture that whimsical and nonsense feel but apply it to a science fair theme.\n\nThe title should reflect the theme and maybe include a playful twist. Maybe something like \"Science Frabberwock\" to mimic the original's \"Jabberwocky\".\n\nNext, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an AABB rhyme scheme and a consistent iambic tetrameter. I need to keep that cadence. Let me think about the elements of a science fair: experiments, models, maybe chaos and excitement. Incorporating invented words is crucial here. Words like \"flumplenooks\" for maybe test tubes or equipment, \"snickerwhip\" for a reaction or something unexpected.\n\nThe user also wants an admonition or preparation part. In \"Jabberwocky\", the father warns the son about the Jabberwock. Here, maybe a teacher advising the student to be careful with their experiments. Then a celebratory return, like returning victorious after the fair.\n\nSo outline the poem: start with setting the scene of the science fair, the strange creatures (invented words), the preparation/admonition, the action (conducting experiments), facing challenges (maybe something going wrong), and then the successful return with a prize or praise.\n\nMake sure to keep the playful rhymes and rhythm. Let me check for the AABB rhyme scheme. Each stanza four lines. Use alliteration and assonance where possible. Also, ensure the invented words make sense in context, even if they're nonsense. Maybe \"burble\" for bubbling, \"fizzle frazzle\" for a reaction.\n\nTest a stanza: \"Beware the Frabberwock, my son! / The tests that bite, the grades that stun, / Beware the Flarp’s bright flibulous glare— / Lest thou a failing mark declare!\" That has the AABB rhyme and the rhythm.

The celebratory return could have the student coming back with a trophy or praise, using words like \"galumphing\" (from the original) and \"jubjub\" maybe as cheers.\n\nCheck for consistent meter.

{"i": 36, "prompt": "Write a poem about third rail hum in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem. Use a few invented coinages and a named creature. Avoid copying lines from the original.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem in the style of \"Jabberwocky\" about the third rail hum. They mentioned including a title, invented coinages, and a named creature. First, I need to recall \"Jabberwocky\"'s features: nonsense words, playful language, a mythical quest, and a specific rhythm.\n\n\"Third rail hum\" makes me think of subway or train systems. The third rail is electrified, so there's a buzzing sound. I should personify this hum as a creature or magical entity. The original has the Jabberwock, so maybe invent a creature like \"Flumplax\" or \"Zingara.\"\n\nNext, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an ABCB rhyme scheme and a galloping meter. Each stanza sets a scene with made-up words. I need to capture the eerie yet rhythmic feeling of the subway.\n\nInvented coinages: maybe \"slurms\" for shadows, \"glitzens\" for lights, \"squelchle\" for a sound effect. The creature's name should be unique but fit the rhythm. \"Squelchmire Snorp\" sounds suitably Jabberwocky-esque.\n\nInclude elements of movement, danger, and a journey. The protagonist might confront the creature embodying the hum. Use alliteration and assonance to mimic the original's flow.\n\nAvoid direct lines from \"Jabberwocky.\" Instead, paraphrase the structure. Start with a warning, describe the setting, introduce the creature, the confrontation, and resolve with the hum's presence.\n\nCheck the rhythm: each line should have around 8 syllables with a stressed-unstressed pattern. Let me draft a few lines.\n\n\"Beware the Squelchmire Snorp, my son!\nThe tracks that slink where slurms are spun,\nBeware the glitzens' gleam and play,\nAnd shun the third rail's thrum by day.\"\n\nThat's a start. Now the creature's description. \"Jaws that jolt with juice uncouth\" relates to electricity. \"Maws agape\" adds menace. The snorp's movement: \"with scribble-sparks it throbs and sings.\"\n\nNext, the narrator's approach: \"He took the Glocken-Pipe in hand...\" Glocken-Pipe as a tool. \"Vorpal\" from original is famous, but user said to avoid copying, so maybe \"vorreon\" or another term. Wait, the user said to avoid copying lines, so don't use \"vorpal blade\" but create a similar feel.\n\n\"Long time the manxle-runes did gleam...\" Manxle-runes as mysterious markings. The Hum's effect: \"my whiskers twitched to the live rail's hymn.\"\n\nConfrontation: \"And as in corkscrew dark I stood, / The Snorp's thrum-buzz did whip the flood.\" Then action: \"I lunged with the oglor Ajax flair, / And--snick!--the Hum ceased its vaulted prayer.\"\n\nBut wait, the third rail hum is constant; maybe the poem should end with it remaining, a lingering presence. So perhaps the creature isn't slain but acknowledged. \"Yet still in tunnels deep it thrums, / The third rail's anthem, hymn of hums.\"\n\nTesting the structure, rhyme, and invented words. Ensure each stanza flows and the creature feels integrated. Check for consistent meter and playful language. Revise any lines that don't fit the rhythm or style. Make sure to include the title that references the third rail and the creature.\n</think>\n\n**The Snorp of Steel**  \n\nBeware the Squelchmire Snorp, my son!  \nThe tracks that slink where slurms are spun,  \nBeware the glitzens' gleam and play,  \nAnd shun the third rail's thrum by day.  \n\n'O, frizzle the flibulux!' townsfolk say—  \nTheir whispers twist in the tunnel's gray,  \nWhere jaws of juice with volts uncouth  \nLurk, gnawing rails in snarling sooth.  \n\nHe took the Glocken-Pipe in hand,  \nWhere manxle-runes across the land  \nDid flicker, squelchle, hum, and thrall,  \nTill the live rail's hymn made my whiskers stall.  \n\n\"Pling!\" went the flazzlepox, \"Pim!\" went the plague,  \nAs the Snorp with scribble-sparks did engage,  \nIts maws agape (all socket and fang)  \nThrumping, thrashing, with a voltish bang.  \n\n\"Beware its throcklepox snare!\" cried I,  \nYet onward crept, where the rails did sigh,  \nTill the Snorp's thrum-buzz did whip the flood,  \nAnd the tunnels boiled with a sound half-blood.  \n\nI lunged with the oglor's Ajax flair,  \nAnd—snick!—the Hum ceased its vaulted prayer…  \nBut mark, when moonmire glints on steel,  \nThe Snorp still thrums, its snicker unsealed.  \n\nSo if in corkscrew dark you stray,  \nWhere third rails thrum their gnarlish day,  \nHeed this: what flibulges, froths, and foams,  \nIs but the Snorp's own live-bronze home.", "info": {"topic": "third rail hum"}, "reward": 0.8947368421052632, "label": "high", "criteria_yes": 17, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.8947368421052632, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}}

Let me recall what \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll is like. It's a nonsense poem with made-up words, playful language, and a rhythmic ballad structure. So I need to mimic that whimsical and rhythmic feel.\n\nFirst, the title should be catchy and have a portmanteau or invented word. Maybe \"The Burn-In Bandersnatch\"? Bandersnatch is from the original, so that ties in.\n\nNext, the poem needs a playful ballad cadence with rhyme. Quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme, perhaps. I need to invent some words related to screens and burn-in. Words like \"glowspin\" or \"pixelwraith\" could work.\n\nThe structure of \"Jabberwocky\" has a journey: preparation, encountering the beast, battle, and return. So here, the journey could be dealing with burn-in. Start with an admonition, like \"Beware the Burn-In Bandersnatch,\" then describe the static images that cause it (\"mimsy memes\"), the tools to fight it (\"screens of vorpal force\"), the struggle (\"flicker-fray\"), and a celebratory return.\n\nMake sure to include an admonition (the warning at the start), the preparation (using tools to prevent burn-in), the battle with the burn-in, and a triumphant return. Invented words should blend with tech terms in a playful way.\n\nCheck the rhythm. Each line should have a similar meter, maybe iambic tetrameter. Let's draft the first stanza: \"Beware the Burn-In Bandersnatch, my son, / The glimmerjaws that cling, / The mimsy memes with static grins / That mar the screen with sting.\" Yes, that flows.\n\nNow the preparation: mention using intervals and changing scenes. \"Take vorpal intervals with care, / And shift the glows that play, / Lest stillborn sprites in corners lair / And fuse with pixelclay.\" Invented words here: vorpal intervals, pixelclay.\n\nThe battle scene: \"He girds his screen of phosphor mesh, / A flicker-fray to face, / With gyroscrolls he sweeps the mesh, / And shakes the stagnant space.\" Using gyroscrolls as a made-up term for movement on the screen.\n\nClimax where burn-in is defeated: \"Then came the Wailer, fixed and grim, / With logos grained in bone, / ‘I’ll sear my mark!’ the specter brimmed, / But still the screens did stroll!\" Maybe use \"Wailer\" as a creature causing burn-in.\n\nFinally, the return with celebration: \"‘Tis done!’ the victor clicks with glee, / As pixels dance anew, / ‘My glyphs now flow where ghosts did be!’ / So warn the Bandersnatch—‘Nay, you!’\" Emphasize victory and warning others.\n\nCheck for rhyme and rhythm consistency. Ensure invented words are sprinkled in without overwhelming. Make sure each stanza builds the narrative: warning, preparation, battle, victory.

It uses nonsense words, playful language, and invented creatures. The original has a rhythm, probably iambic tetrameter. So I need to mimic that structure.\n\nFirst, the title should be catchy with a made-up word. Maybe something like \"The Echoflux\" or \"Underpass Frumious\". Wait, the user said to include a named creature. The original has the Jabberwock. Let me invent a creature name, maybe \"Skreallix\" or \"Glintwings\". Let's go with \"Skreallix\".\n\nNext, the setting is an underpass. How to describe it with whimsy? Borrow words from \"Jabberwocky\" like \"tulgey\" but create new ones. \"Brumal\" for winter? \"Flish\" like fish but not exactly. The echo is the main theme, so personify it as a creature that dwells there.\n\nNeed some coinages: \"flim-flam\", \"jinkle\", \"whiffling\", \"slurb\". Let's make sure the poem rhymes and has a similar quatrain structure. Each stanza four lines with ABAB rhyme scheme.\n\nStart with a warning, like \"Beware the...\" Maybe \"Beware the Skreallix's echoflux\". Then describe the underpass as \"vavisht\" (invented word) and \"grimbul\". Action verbs: \"slink\", \"creep\", \"loom\". Use alliteration: \"shadows shiver\", \"flishes flail\".\n\nMiddle stanzas can introduce the creature's appearance and the danger of the echo. \"Eyes like twin glints\" and \"voices vortex\". Maybe a moral about heeding the echo. End with a resolution, perhaps the traveler escapes by outwitting the echo.\n\nCheck for originality, avoid copying lines.

Let me recall what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It's got a playful, nonsense vibe with made-up words that still sound meaningful. The rhythm is pretty consistent, with a ballad meter—four beats per line, alternating stresses.\n\nFirst, I need a title that captures the essence of a printer jam but with a whimsical twist. Maybe something like \"The Frumious Jam\" since \"frumious\" is a blend of \"fuming\" and \"furious\" from the original poem. That fits the frustrating yet fantastical theme.\n\nNow, the structure. The original has quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. I'll stick to that. Start with an admonition, warning the reader about the dangers of the printer jam. Then build up the action, maybe a battle with the jam itself, using invented words for the printer parts: \"glitzen\", \"flamber\", \"snick\". \n\nThe middle part should have a climax where the jam is confronted. Maybe personify the jam as a beast. Then, after the struggle, a triumphant return where the printer works again, with celebratory language. Need some playful terms here, like \"burble\" and \"chortle\", similar to Carroll's style.\n\nCheck the invented words: \"glitzen\" could mean shiny parts, \"flamber\" a mix of flame and ember for the printer's heat, \"snick\" a sharp sound. Make sure they blend in without breaking the flow. Rhymes need to be consistent but not too forced. Lines should flow with a bouncy cadence.\n\nAlso, include an admonition at the start and a celebration at the end. Maybe open with \"Beware the Glitzen\" to mirror \"Beware the Jabberwock\". Use alliteration where possible, like \"frazzled gears\" and \"vicious loop of fate\". \n\nNow, assemble the verses. First stanza sets the scene, second the problem arises, third the battle, fourth the victory, fifth the return. Check syllable count to maintain the meter. Read it aloud to ensure the rhythm matches the original's feel.\n\nPotential tweaks: \"Furble\" as a verb for malfunctioning, \"splin\" for a part of the paper. Make sure each invented word contributes to the imagery without confusing.

The rhythm is trochaic, which is a strong, rhythmic pattern. So, I should maintain that meter.\n\nThe theme is déjà vu. How to convey that feeling of familiar strangeness? Maybe use imagery that's both vivid and slightly off-kilter. Invented coinages are necessary—perhaps blend parts of real words related to memory or time. Words like \"remeant\" (from \"re-mean\" or \"re-meant\") or \"timefraze\" (time freeze) could work.\n\nA named creature is required. Carroll used the Jabberwock; I need something that embodies déjà vu. \"The Remnori\" – from \"reminisce\" or \"memory\". It should be something that the protagonist confronts, creating that sense of familiarity.\n\nStructure-wise, start with a setting, introduce the creature, the challenge, and the resolution. Use alliteration and archaic language for that authentic feel. Avoid any direct lines from the original but mimic the structure.\n\nLet me draft the first stanza, setting the scene with \"sunless\" and \"shimmmerglade\" to create a dreamlike atmosphere. Then introduce the Remnori with a warning. The middle stanzas can describe the encounter, using coined words to build the eerie, familiar tension. The resolution should leave the reader with the lingering feeling of déjà vu, perhaps with the creature vanishing as suddenly as it appeared.\n\nCheck for meter consistency and ensure the invented words fit naturally.

Let me recall that \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll uses made-up words, playful language, and a rhythmic, ballad-like structure. So I need to mimic that whimsical feel with invented terms.\n\nFirst, the title should be catchy and alliterative, maybe something like \"The Muzicry Mallet\" to incorporate musical elements and a fantastical weapon, similar to \"Jabberwock\".\n\nNext, the poem structure: quatrains with an AABB rhyme scheme. Each stanza should tell part of the story. Start with an admonition, a warning from the speaker to the listener, then the journey into the music room, facing challenges with invented instruments or creatures, and a triumphant return.\n\nInvented words: \"flumplenax\" for a drum, \"squabblepipes\" for dissonant instruments, \"twinklesticks\" for something like sparkly percussion. Maybe \"squelch\" as a verb for silencing wrong notes.\n\nInclude a menacing force in the music room—perhaps \"the Screetch\" that represents chaos or difficult music. The hero uses the Muzicry Mallet to defeat it, restoring harmony.\n\nEnsure the rhythm is playful and bouncy, with alliteration and internal rhymes. Check that each stanza flows to the next, building up the adventure and resolution.\n\nFinally, a celebratory return where music flows smoothly, and the protagonist is hailed. End with a warning that the journey isn't for the faint-hearted, tying back to the initial admonition.\n\nLet me draft each stanza, ensuring the made-up words fit naturally and the cadence matches \"Jabberwocky\".

Avoid copying lines from the original.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about Layover Bay in the style of \"Jabberwocky\" with a title, some invented words, and a named creature. They also don't want any direct lines from the original. Let me start by recalling the \"Jabberwocky\" style. It uses a lot of portmanteaus and nonsense words that sound meaningful. The structure is quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme and a consistent meter.\n\nFirst, the title. Maybe something like \"The Layover Bay Beetections\" combining \"beetle\" and \"detections\"? Wait, \"Beetections\" isn't perfect. Alternatively, \"The Layover Bay Borogroves\" but Borogoves are from the original. Need an original creature. Let's call it a \"Snickerwack\". Hmm, not sure. Maybe \"Glintzenfins\" as a creature name.\n\nInvented coinages: need to create words that fit the whimsical feel. Words like \"flumplenook\", \"snickelgrass\", \"jinkleplack\", \"floopet wings\". The creature could be the \"Snurblatt\". Let me check the rhyme and rhythm.\n\nFirst stanza: Setting the scene at Layover Bay. Mention the time of day, maybe twilight. Introduce the creature. \"Beware the Snurblatt's glintzenfins, / That flibber in the dusk's loose nets—\" Hmm, \"dusk's loose nets\" gives a vague, mystical image. Then the action: \"It mimsies mid the muzzled piers, / Where frothy tonguesters fest'.\" \"Mimsies\" is from the original, though. Should avoid that. Replace with \"It lurks\".\n\nNext stanza: Describe the environment. \"The snickelgrass in swirls does grow, / And jinkleplack seeds splay—\" \"Snickelgrass\" and \"jinkleplack\" are new. Then a warning: \"Take heed, for time here slithers slow— / The clocks all chew their hours astray.\" Clocks chewing hours gives a sense of time distortion.\n\nThird stanza: The creature's appearance. \"Its fimbulfangs in briny air / Do glimmer, glaucous, cold— / It whiffling waits with flop-eared care, / Where jellynauts their vigils hold.\" \"Fimbulfangs\" from original? Wait, \"fimbulfly\" is in Jabberwocky. Maybe use \"fimbulfangs\" as a variation. \"Jellynauts\" instead of real creatures.\n\nFourth stanza: The traveler's dilemma. \"So should you pause on Layover's shore, / Watch for the Snurblatt's sly pounce— / Lest in its maw, lost, you implore, / The tides to fetch you from this trounce!\" Emphasizes the danger, using \"trounce\" as a playful word.\n\nCheck for meter: Each line should be eight syllables, iambic tetrameter. Let's scan:\n\nBeware the Snurblatt's glintzenfins, (8)\nThat flibber in the dusk's loose nets— (8)\nIt lurks mid muzzled piers' embrace, (8)\nWhere frothy tonguesters fest' (7) Hmm, maybe \"festers\" to make 8? \"Where frothy tonguesters fester\".\n\nAdjust lines for consistency. Also, ensure invented words are original and not copied. The creature name \"Snurblatt\" is new. The coinages like \"glintzenfins\", \"flibber\", \"muzzled piers\", \"tonguesters\", \"snickelgrass\", \"jinkleplack\", \"slithers slow\", \"chew their hours\", \"fimbulfangs\", \"glaucous, cold\", \"whiffling\", \"flop-eared care\", \"jellynauts\", \"vigils hold\", \"trounce\".\n\nSeems okay. Title: \"The Layover Bay Snurblatt\". Wait, the user said to include a title. Maybe \"The Layover Bay Beetections\" was a stretch. Alternatively, use the creature's name: \"The Layover Bay Snurblatt\". Or \"Snurblatt of Layover Bay\". But the example in \"Jabberwocky\" is \"'Twas brillig...\" with the title separate. So the poem's title should be distinct. Maybe \"The Layover Bay Borogroves\" but avoiding original terms. \"Layover Bay's Flibberjibits\"? Not sure. Let's go with \"Of Layover Bay's Frabjulon Tide\" – \"frabjulon\" is a nonsense word, \"tide\" relates to the bay.\n\nPutting it all together, ensuring original lines and creature name.

Add an admonition or preparation and a celebratory return. Use some invented words.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about a conference room in the style of \"Jabberwocky\". Let me recall that \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll uses lots of made-up words, playful language, and a ballad rhythm. So I need to invent some nonsense terms related to meetings and office environments.\n\nFirst, the title should be catchy and a bit whimsical. Maybe something like \"The Burblewock's Boardroom Bout\". \"Burble\" sounds like a mix of babble and bubble, suggesting the nonsense talk in meetings. \"Bout\" implies a struggle, which fits the adversarial feel of some conferences.\n\nNext, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. I'll follow that. The first stanza needs to set the scene with some invented creatures or terms. Words like \"momeflakes\" (a mix of mome from the original and flakes, maybe referring toaimless people), \"glinsk\" (a shiny but possibly useless thing), \"snicker-snack\" from the original can be adapted here.\n\nThen the admonition part. In \"Jabberwocky\", the father warns the son about the Jabberwock. Here, maybe warn about the \"Burblewock\" with made-up verbs like \"ululate\" and \"flunge\". The preparation could involve taking a \"vorpal pen\" instead of a sword, keeping the playful tone.\n\nThe battle scene in the conference room. Use terms like \"slithy salespitch\", \"frumious flowcharts\" (frumious is from the original), \"bandersnatch budgets\". The protagonist outsmarts the Burblewock with jargon, leading to its defeat.\n\nThe return should be celebratory. Maybe the protagonist returns with the \"snech of the hour\" (snech as a nonsense achievement), everyone cheers, and there's a feast with wordplay on office snacks like \"mimsy muffins\" and \"coffee that's frabjuliced\".\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme and rhythm. Each stanza should have four lines with alternating rhymes. The made-up words need to fit the stress patterns of the original. Also, ensure playful and whimsical language throughout, with the right mix of invented terms and recognizable conference room elements.\n\nLet me draft the stanzas step by step, ensuring each part transitions smoothly and maintains the ballad cadence. Read it aloud to test the rhythm. Adjust any words that don't fit the meter. For example, \"He took the vorpal pen in hand\" mirrors \"He took the vorpal sword in hand\" from the original. Replace \"galumphing\" with \"flunge\" to keep the action moving.\n\nInclude an admonition from a mentor figure, the battle with the Burblewock using jargon, and a triumphant return. Make sure the celebratory ending contrasts with the initial danger, highlighting the protagonist's success. Use alliteration and assonance to enhance the musicality, like \"flumplenooks\" and \"glinsk\".\n\nFinally, review for any forced rhymes or unclear invented words. Ensure the poem stays true to the \"Jabberwocky\" style while effectively portraying the conference room scenario with its unique challenges and victory.\n</think>\n\n**The Burblewock’s Boardroom Bout**  \n\nBeware the Burblewock, my son,  \nwith momeflakes grim and glinsk,  \nthe snicker-snack of spreadsheets spun  \nand PowerPoint’s dread blink.  \n\nHe’s frumious, fanged with deadlines tight,  \nululate reports he’ll flunge,  \nand lured by coffee’s lurid light,  \nyour focus to a frabble-stung!  \n\nHe took the vorpal pen in hand,  \nGP’s glint in fevered stare,  \nthrough flumplenooks where buzzwords stand,  \nto slay the jabber of the air.  \n\nHe shloothe slimers of the slide,  \noutglibbed the Burblewock’s dread might,  \nwith jargon spells he’d learned to bide—  \n“Let’s circle back to synergize!”  \n\nThe room erupted in a roar,  \nas foonloop graphs turned fickle-green,  \nhe slew the beast with “action items,”  \nthen claimed the snech of the hour’s sheen.  \n\nNow galumph home, my beamish lad,  \nlet mimsy muffins fuel the cheer,  \nthe team all chortles, glad and mad—  \nand coffee flows, now frabjuliced here!", "info": {"topic": "conference room"}, "reward": 0.9473684210526315, "label": "high", "criteria_yes": 18, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.9473684210526315, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}}

The title should be catchy with alliteration.\n\nFirst, the title. \"The Awl's Frumious Pursuit\" – \"frumious\" is a nod to Carroll's \"frumious bandersnatch.\" Good start.\n\nNext, the setting. \"Twas brillig and the sl Kummocks\" – \"sl\" as a prefix gives it a Carroll-esque feel. Kummocks as creatures, maybe they're grumpy or rocky. \"Borogove\" referenced, but I need a new creature. \"Snicker-snack\" is from the original, but the user said to avoid copying lines.

Rhyming scheme is important—maybe quatrains with ABAB rhyme.\n\nThe admonition part should warn the reader about the creep. The celebratory return needs a victorious ending, so the protagonist overcomes the creep. Let's outline the poem: introduction of the creep, the warning, the battle, and the triumphant return.\n\nNeed to maintain the playful cadence. Use alliteration and assonance to keep it flowing. Let me draft the first stanza. Something like \"Beware the Creep who slinkles in\" to mimic \"Beware the Jabberwock.\" Then introduce some actions of the creep, maybe \"jink and jim-jam\" for playful movement.\n\nFor the invented words, ensure they sound like they could mean something related to creeping. \"Flish\" for a quick escape, \"flum\" for a sound. The admonition comes early, then the preparation, like a vorpal blade but adjusted—maybe \"trust your glimmerblade.\" The battle scene with some nonsense verbs, and the victory with a celebration. End with a return home, having defeated the creep, using cheerful language.\n\nCheck the meter—each line should have a similar syllable count and stress pattern. Read it aloud to ensure it flows.

It's got whimsical language, made-up words, and a narrative with a heroic quest and strange creatures. So I need to capture that essence without copying any lines.\n\nFirst, the title. \"Desire Path\" is the main subject, but maybe add a Carroll-esque twist. \"Th' Wantway's Wamble\" sounds good, using alliteration and a made-up word \"Wamble\" to suggest a winding path.\n\nNow, the creature. Carroll has the Jabberwock, Bandersnatch, etc. Let's invent a creature related to desire paths. Maybe \"Snicker-Snacks\" or \"Gleebeasts\"? Wait, the user mentioned a named creature. \"Glimmerwings\" might be too serene. How about \"Gleeburrs\"? They could be obstacles that the path navigates. Or \"Bramblewights\" – something that entangles but is overcome by desire.\n\nSetting the scene: twilight, a forest, the path appears. Use nonsense verbs like \"wriggled\" or \"wove.\" Make the path active, almost alive. \"Wizzle\" as a verb? Maybe \"wizzles\" through the trees. Include some onomatopoeia like \"squelch\" or \"sough.\"\n\nDescribing the journey: moving through obstacles. The creature's lair, maybe with \"Gleeburrs\" that \"snickered\" or \"snarled.\" Battle of wills between the traveler and the creature. Use alliteration: \"frabjulon\" flame? Wait, Carroll uses that. Avoid direct copies. Instead, \"flibloom\" or \"flumplenooks.\"\n\nClimax: confronting the creature, perhaps with a mirror-like shield reflecting the path's desire. The path's persistence triumphs. Ending with the path leading to a destination, maybe a village, showing the result of desire.\n\nCheck for coinages: \"wizzle,\" \"flibloom,\" \"Gleeburrs,\" \"Snicker-Snacks.\" Ensure they fit rhythmically. Maintain the ABAB rhyme scheme. Read aloud for rhythm and meter.\n\nLet me draft a few lines:\n\nBeware the Gleeburrs, my son,  \nThe frumpus-fens, the mimsy morn—  \nThe Wantway's will when day's undone,  \nNor go when Glimmerwings are born.  \n\nHmm, maybe \"mimsy\" is too derivative.

{"i": 47, "prompt": "Write a poem about morning fog in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem. Keep a playful ballad cadence with some rhyme. Add an admonition or preparation and a celebratory return. Use some invented words.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a poem about morning fog in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" Let's start by recalling what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It's a nonsense poem by Lewis Carroll, known for its made-up words, playful language, and a rhythmic, ballad-like structure with a consistent rhyme scheme, usually ABAB.\n\nFirst, the title. The original has \"Jabberwocky,\" so maybe something like \"The Fog of Frumious Dawn\" to incorporate \"frumious,\" which is a blend of \"fuming\" and \"furious\" from the original. That fits the playful, invented feel.\n\nNext, the structure. Quatrains with four-line stanzas, each with an ABAB rhyme scheme. The cadence should be lively, with a mix of iambs and trochees, similar to the galloping rhythm of \"Jabberwocky.\"\n\nInvented words: I'll need to create some. Maybe \"snicker-snacks\" could be adapted to \"snickerfog\" or \"mimsy\" to \"mimsy mist.\" Also, terms like \"whiffling\" or \"burble\" might work. Let me brainstorm some fog-related nonsense words: \"glibble,\" \"splink,\" \"flumplenooks,\" \"twizzle,\" \"gallimaufry.\"\n\nThe poem should have an admonition or preparation part, then a journey through the fog, and a celebratory return. So, maybe start with a warning to brave the fog, then describe the challenges within it, and end with triumph and return.\n\nFirst stanza: Introduce the fog and the need for preparation. Use \"frumious\" and a made-up creature, like \"jubjub birds\" but maybe adapt it to \"Fumblers.\" \n\"Beware the frumious dawn's befogged might,\nWhen Fumblers grope and Glimmerwings take flight;\nThe mimsy mist that munches, slimy-bright—\nBeware the Fog of Frumious Dawn's cold bite!\"\n\nSecond stanza: The journey into the fog. Use \"whiffling\" and \"burble\" sounds. Maybe \"splink\" as a verb. Introduce another creature. \n\"With snicker-snik with glimmer-blade in hand,\nWe splink through slurries of a glibble-land;\nThe Frumious Fog froths, whirls in jubjub bands—\nBeware its wuggle-snouts that flumplenooks demand!\"\n\nThird stanza: The confrontation or challenge. Use \"twizzle\" and \"gallimaufry.\" \n\"Beneath the k CHIP of moon's milky eye,\nWe twizzle through its woolly gallimaufry.\nFrumious fangs may nip and vapors sigh—\nBut brave the Fog-wool's snicker-fog, and try!\"\n\nFourth stanza: The triumphant return. Celebratory tone with \"whiffling\" and \"burble.\" \n\"Then when the sun's first snortlein splits the gray,\nWe'll whiffle back, with burbles, jigging gay.\nFor those who brave the Frumious Fog's dismay\nShall prance in Zingpocket's glimmer-fray!\"\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme. Each stanza should follow ABAB. Let me verify:\n\nFirst stanza: might, flight, bright, bite – yes, ABAB.\nSecond: hand, land, bands, demand – ABAB.\nThird: eye, gallimaufry (slant rhyme?), sigh, try. Hmm, \"gallimaufry\" and \"eye\" don't rhyme perfectly. Maybe adjust to \"gallimaufry\" and \"try\" – needs fixing. Let me change the third stanza's first line end to \"gallimaufry\" and third line to \"try.\" Maybe:\n\n\"Beneath the moon's milky mimsy maw,\nWe twizzle through its woolly gallimaufry.\nFrumious fangs may nicker-snack and gnaw—\nBut brave the Fog-wool's snicker-fog, and draw!\"\n\nNow the rhymes are maw, gallimaufry (still a problem). Maybe rephrase:\n\n\"Beneath the moon's mimsy twinkling eye,\nWe twizzle through its wuggle gallimaufry.\nFrumious fangs may nicker-snack and sigh—\nBut brave the Fog-wool's snicker-fog, and try!\"\n\nNow eye, gallimaufry (still not perfect), but Carroll used slant rhymes. Maybe acceptable. Alternatively, change \"gallimaufry\" to \"gallimaufry\" and the end word. Not sure. Alternatively, use \"galimatlas\" or another word.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n\"Beneath the moon's mimsy glimmer-shroud,\nWe twizzle through the Fog's own gallimaufry.\nFrumious fangs may nicker-snack and cloud—\nBut brave the snicker-fog, and jabber proud!\"\n\nShroud, gallimaufry, cloud, proud – slant rhymes. Maybe it's okay in the style.\n\nAlternatively, stick with original and accept near rhymes as Carroll did.\n\nFinally, check the meter. Each line should be around 8-10 syllables, with a trochaic beat. Let's see:\n\n\"Beware the fru-MI-us dawn's be-FOGG-ed MIGHT,\" (11 syllables) – maybe trim to \"Beware the frumious dawn's befogged might,\" (10 syllables). Good.\n\nContinue this for each line. Ensure the cadence is playful and ballad-like.\n\nNow, compile all the stanzas with the title. Read through for flow and adherence to the style. Make sure there's an admonition (beware), preparation (with glimmer-blade), the journey, and the celebratory return with \"whiffling\" and \"jigging gay.\"\n\nInvented words: frumious, Fumblers, Glimmerwings, mimsy mist, snicker-snik, glibble-land, Frumious Fog, wuggle-snouts, flumplenooks, k CHIP (maybe \"k'chip\"?), milky eye, gallimaufry, snortlein, Zingpocket's glimmer-fray.\n\nYes, this should meet the requirements. Add the title and check the formatting.\n</think>\n\n**The Fog of Frumious Dawn**  \n\nBeware the frumious dawn’s befogged might,  \nWhen Fumblers grope and Glimmerwings take flight;  \nThe mimsy mist that munches, slimy-bright—  \n*Beware the Fog of Frumious Dawn’s cold bite!*  \n\nWith snicker-snik with glimmer-blade in hand,  \nWe splink through slurries of a glibble-land;  \nThe Frumious Fog froths, whirls in jubjub bands—  \n*Beware its wuggle-snouts that flumplenooks demand!*  \n\nBeneath the k’CHIP of moon’s milky maw,  \nWe twizzle through its woolly gallimaufry.  \nFrumious fangs may nicker-snack and gnaw—  \n*But brave the Fog-wool’s snicker-fog, and draw!*  \n\nThen when the sun’s first snortlein splits the gray,  \nWe’ll whiffle back, with burbles, jigging gay.  \nFor those who brave the Frumious Fog’s dismay  \n*Shall prance in Zingpocket’s glimmer-fray!*", "info": {"topic": "morning fog"}, "reward": 0.7894736842105263, "label": "medium", "criteria_yes": 15, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.7894736842105263, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 0.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}}

Avoid copying lines from the original.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about the \"third rail hum\" in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" Let me break this down. First, I need to recall what \"Jabberwocky\" is like. It's a nonsense poem by Lewis Carroll with made-up words, playful language, and a whimsical feel, but also a narrative structure. The key elements are invented coinages, a named creature, and the style that balances chaos with rhythm.\n\nThird rail hum refers to the sound of electricity in subway systems. So, I need to translate that into a fantastical setting. Carroll uses creatures like the Jabberwock, Bandersnatch, etc. I should invent a creature related to the third rail, maybe something electrical or mechanical.\n\nNext, the coinages. Words like \"whiffling,\" \"galumphing\" from the original. I need to make similar words that evoke the sound or the movement related to the third rail. Maybe \"snickerlings\" for sparks, \"glowspires\" for lights, \"VDUs\" as a monster (maybe an acronym, like Voltage Draining Usurpers?).\n\nThe title should be catchy and Carroll-esque. Maybe alliterative and with some invented words. \"The Frumious Third Rail's Hum\" — \"frumious\" is from the original (a blend of fuming and furious), so that's a good nod.\n\nStructure: Quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme, like \"Jabberwocky.\" Each stanza introduces a creature or an action. The narrative should have a clear progression: setting the scene, introducing the threat (the third rail hum), the battle or action, and the aftermath.\n\nLines to avoid copying from the original. So no \"slithy toves\" or \"vorpal blade.\" But the rhythm and meter should match—mostly eight-syllable lines with some variation.\n\nFirst stanza: Introduce the setting, the subway as a strange world. Maybe \"Beware the Snicker-Snack\" as a creature? Wait, no, the main creature here should be the third rail's hum. Or maybe a monster that embodies the hum. Let's call it \"the Zhisser\" or \"the Hum-wyrm.\" Hmm.\n\nWait, \"Jabberwocky\" starts with \"Twas brillig and the slithy toves...\" So first line sets the scene. Let me do something similar. \"Beware the Snicker-Snack’s sharp bite, / The frumious hum that gnaws the night—\" Here, Snicker-Snack could be a creature, and the hum is a separate element. The third rail's hum is the central phenomenon, so maybe it's created by a creature.\n\nNext, introducing the traveler: \"Take warning as you wend the deep, / Where glowspires sing in gloom asleep,\" Glowspires could be the lights in the tunnel. The traveler hears the hum and encounters the creature.\n\nInvented coinages: \"VDUs\" as a monster (Voltage DrainingUsurpers?), \"Flish\" (a blend of flash and fish?), \"Flish that flibulux in the dark.\" Flibulux could be a verb meaning sparkling or moving quickly. Maybe \"Flish\" are the sparks.\n\nClimax: The confrontation with the third rail's creature. \"He drew the Quizzlerod of old, / To quell the spark that time had stole;\" Quizzlerod is an invented weapon, maybe something that disrupts the electricity.\n\nEnding: The hum is defeated or tamed, but there's a sense of lingering danger. \"Yet still the tunnels thrum and vibrate— / Beware, the third rail’s hum waits still,\"\n\nNeed to check the meter. Let me count syllables. For example:\n\n\"Beware the Snicker-Snack’s sharp bite, (10)\nThe frumious hum that gnaws the night— (11)\" Hmm, maybe adjust to match more closely. Carroll's meter is a bit inconsistent but generally iambic tetrameter. Let me see:\n\nOriginal lines:\n'Twas brillig and the slithy toves (8)\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe: (9)\nAll mimsy were the borogoves, (8)\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe. (8)\n\nSo some variation but mostly 8 syllables. My lines are a bit long. Let me tighten:\n\n\"Beware the Snicker-Snack's bite, (8)\nThe frumious hum that gnaws night— (9)\" Maybe acceptable.\n\nOverall, the poem should have the whimsical, playful language, invented words, a narrative arc, and the third rail as a central element with its creature and challenges. Make sure each stanza contributes to the story and builds the fantastical world.\n</think>\n\n**The Frumious Third Rail's Hum**  \n\nBeware the Snicker-Snack’s sharp bite,  \nThe frumious hum that gnaws the night—  \nA zing of death, a spark of spite,  \nWhere VDUs prowl, void of light.  \n\nTake warning as you wend the deep,  \nWhere glowspires sing in gloom asleep,  \nNor tangle with the Flish that flibulux,  \nLest volts in wrath your soul bewray.  \n\nHe chanced upon the live rail’s lair,  \nWhere Zhisser’s song did sizzle, flare—  \nA thrum that bends both bone and air,  \nAnd fries the wits of those who dare.  \n\n“Arise!” the courage-kin did shout,  \nAs near he crept with wary rout,  \nThe Hum-wyrm coiled, a livid rout—  \nIts fangs agleam with stolen volt.  \n\nHe drew the Quizzlerod of old,  \nTo quell the spark that time had stole,  \nAnd smote the beast with glimmering hold,  \nTill crackling dark its wrath did mold.  \n\nYet still the tunnels thrum and vibrate—  \nBeware, the third rail’s hum waits still,  \nAnd should your footstep falter late,  \nThe Snicker’s bite outsnicks the frill.", "info": {"topic": "third rail hum"}, "reward": 0.8421052631578947, "label": "high", "criteria_yes": 16, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.8421052631578947, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}}
