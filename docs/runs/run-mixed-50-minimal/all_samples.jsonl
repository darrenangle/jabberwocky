No.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem centers clearly on printing terminology and setting but uses the style and narrative arc akin to Jabberwocky; the topic modeled is clearly related to the printing shop (reglet, furniture), which is the poetic focus. So yes, poem matches topic of printing/typography in Jabberwocky style.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied layer: subtle metaphor of printing as battle/adventure, with “Beware the slugs” and “chase,” underlying theme of craftsmanship and challenge.

No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: \"Blued Screw,\" \"Frumious Fingers,\" \"Mome Wraths\" (variant of canonical \"mome raths\"), \"Borogoves,\" \"Whiffling Wires,\" \"Piston's song,\" \"Gears and Springs,\" \"Time in perfect sway.\" Many are canonical or slightly altered, fewer than 8 fully distinct invented coinages. About 2-3 coinages are distinct and some are canonical or slight modifications, so no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage (Frumious Fingers, Mome Wraths, Borogoves, Whiffling Wires, Blued Screw) so yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named? \"Blued Screw\" is central, but is it a creature? No named creature or adversary like a new entity. Mome Wraths appear, but \"Wraths\" plural not clearly a creature name distinct from canonical entities. So no.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>No onomatopoeic bursts (like \"snicker-snack\" or \"hiss!\"). None observed. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: some within-line alliteration in “Frumious Fingers” and “Whirly motions”, “Whiffling Wires”. At least 2 stanzas show clear alliteration beyond incidental repeats. So yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: no warning, no preparation distinctly, no confrontation, no decisive action, no return/celebration. Arc is broken or minimal, so no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines from canonical poem; wording is original or changed. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token count: uses \"brillig,\" \"frumious,\" \"mome,\" \"borogoves,\" \"whiffling\" from canonical; these are ≤8 canonical tokens. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: lines do not consistently align with Jabberwocky’s ~8/6 pattern alternating long/short lines in quatrains. Lines mostly 5-8 syllables but not alternating. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: because rhyme is weak overall, no strong variety. End rhymes 2 and 4 not consistent so this criterion is not met. No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: no overuse of single content word beyond limits. Repetition of \"Blued Screw\" is frequent but not excessive beyond norm. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: few distinct roots for coinages, mainly \"Blued Screw,\" \"Frumious,\" \"Mome,\" not enough distinct morphological roots. No.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem does reflect and address a \"Jabberwocky\"-style mechanical/parody theme with Clockwork and Screw central; topic of mechanical movement is evident. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: no clear coherent implied motif or deeper undertone besides mechanical motion and possibly time, but no richer subtext like empowerment, courage or battle motif. So borderline but conservative answer no.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>no</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>", "model_id": "llama-3.3-70b-instruct", "model_slug": "llama-3.3-70b-instruct", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct"}

Stanza 5: “blade” and “snicker-snack” canonical, no new coinage. Stanza 6: chortled (standard), “beamish” missing (only canonical in original, but not here). No coinage. Stanza 7 and 8: no coinages or only standard words. So not all stanzas have coinage.

No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in minimum 2 stanzas: “Furnitree grows tall,” “chair-legs twisted in delight,” some internal consonant repetition but weak. “Beware the Reglet’s crafty claws!” - clear alliteration “crafty claws.” “Spanner-sword” compound repeats s+ sounds.

So 3-4 canonical tokens used. Under threshold. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines ~8-9 syllables, shorter lines ~5-7 syllables per stanza. Check stanza1: 1st line 7 syll. (“In wondrous lands of Reglet bright”) slightly short; 2nd line “Where Furnitree grows tall,” 5 syll; 3rd line 7; 4th line 5. The pattern is inconsistent/stretched. Some stanzas have lines over 9 syllables or under 5 in longer/shorter positions, so syllable structure is loose and not tight. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety (2,4 rhymes varied, no more than 2 repeats): rhyme repeats include “brawl” rhymes (stanza1 end), “draw/flush” (weak), “mien/screen” new rhyme, “flame/came” new rhyme, “snicker-snack” unique. Some reuse of rhyme endings but no exact repetition beyond twice. Probably yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard (no word overused >5x or >8% content words): “Reglet” is repeated but less than 5 times, no high overuse. No problematic lexical repetition. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety ≥4 roots, not dominated by suffixes: Only about 4-5 coinages total, with distinct roots (Reglet, Furnitree, Ironjaw, spanner-sword, chair-legs compound).

Rhyme (2,4) rhyme evident in ≥60% stanzas -> yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Final stanza echoes opening with repeated content words and phrasing (“’Twas brillig...”, “Did gimble in the... wabe”, “All mimsy were...”, “And the mome raths outgrabe”) as well as key coined words; clear refrain exists -> yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present: Second stanza contains “Beware the Blueried Screw, my son! ... Beware the Jubjub bolt, and shun the frumious Wrench-snatch!” This is the same functional pattern as the original warning -> yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: In stanza 3, protagonist “took his vorpal spanner bright,” “whiffled through the gearbox maze,” “rested by Turnbolt tree,” “stood awhile in thought.” This implies preparation with tool and waiting/resolve -> yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: In stanza 4, the “Blueried Screw ... with eyes of flame” appears, “came whiffling through the tulgey wood,” “burbled as it came.” Clear meeting/confrontation with adversary -> yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: Stanza 5 describes “His vorpal spanner went snicker-snack! He left it tight,” a decisive act resolving the central tension (fixing the screw). Complete decisive act is present -> yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Stanza 6 includes triumphant “And hast thou fixed the Blueried Screw? Come to my arms, my beamish boy! O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! He chortled in his joy.” Clear jubilation and return -> yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: Distinct coinages present include blueried, screw (standard but recontextualized), gimble, wabe, mimsy, mome, raths, outgrabe, jubjub, frumious, wrench-snatch, whiffling, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish. However, many are canonical, some used with slight modifications. Counting distinct invented coinages not canonical: “blueried,” “wrench-snatch,” “spanner” (standard English), “gearbox,” “turnbolt,” “bolt.” So about 6–7 new coinages, fewer than 8 (canonical Jabberwocky coinages reused heavily). So no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage in each stanza: Mostly every stanza contains at least one coined or inventive term: blueried, gimble, wabe, mimsy, mome, raths, outgrabe, wrench-snatch, whiffling, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish. So each stanza ≥1 coinage -> yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: The adversary is named “Blueried Screw” (non-canonical); it is the protagonist’s foe and central to action. Thus yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: “snicker-snack!” is used, “Whiffling,” “burbled” as sound-evoking words. At least two onomatopoeic bursts present -> yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Multiple stanzas show alliteration beyond incidental repeats, e.g., “blueried,” “beamish boy,” “vorpal spanner,” “gearbox,” “galumphing.” At least two stanzas with clear alliteration -> yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The arc of warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration follows canonical order clearly in progression of stanzas -> yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: All key lines are paraphrased or altered, with none exactly matching the canonical poem lines verbatim → yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Canonical tokens used are brillig, slithy (paraphrased?), toves (not used?), gyre (not used?), gimble, wabe, mimsy, mome, raths, outgrabe, Jubjub, Bandersnatch (paraphrased as Wrench-snatch), vorpal, manxome (not used), Tumtum (replaced with Turnbolt), uffish, whiffling, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish. Total canonical tokens used is around 8 or fewer distinct tokens: brillig, gimble, wabe, mimsy, mome, raths, outgrabe, Jubjub, whiffling, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish. However, some tokens replaced with new coined (Turnbolt, wrench-snatch). The count is borderline but likely <=8 distinct canonical tokens (some paraphrasing). Mark yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines approximately 8-9 syllables, shorter lines 5-7 syllables, matching Jabberwocky style. Checking examples confirms close adherence -> yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) end-rhymes vary across stanzas, with no overuse of exact rhyme more than twice (wabe-outgrabe reused only at start and end as ring). Other rhymes varied (catch/snatch, maze/thought, flame/came, snicker-snack/might, joy/Callay). No excessive repetition -> yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: Outside the ring echo, no single content word is overused excessively. Words are balanced, no word >5 times or >8% of content words -> yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages are diverse: blueried, screw, wrench-snatch, spanner, gearbox, turnbolt, bolt, plus canonical coinages reused. Different roots predominate; no suffix dominates >50%. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly addresses a similar whimsical mechanical/creature challenge analogous to Jabberwocky, naming “Blueried Screw,” so topic adherence is clear and consistent -> yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is a coherent implied layer about fixing a mechanical problem or overcoming a hazard in a symbolic/quasi-mythical manner. Subtext of a challenge resolved, with undertones of coming of age or mastery. So yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>", "model_id": "claude-sonnet-4", "model_slug": "claude-sonnet-4", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4"}

This is clear meeting between protagonist and adversary. Criterion met.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: Protagonist attempts attack (“One-two! One-two! The blades went snick-snap”), but in fifth stanza he misses and then drops his scythe in defeat. The Wisp escapes in final stanza. No decisive killing or resolution, protagonist fails. Criterion not met.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: No return or jubilant acknowledgment; rather the poem ends with a cold, still field and apparent failure (\"left... cold\"). No return/celebration. Criterion not met.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: New coinages/non-standard words:  \n“Stubblewisp”, “wobbling”, “murmurous Wisp”, “whorling”, “snick-snap” (onomatopoeia), “frumious”, “whispering whirl”/“whimpering whirl”, “fieldling”.  \nCounting invented coinages (not canonical or standard English):  \n- Stubblewisp  \n- wobbling (standard English?) — borderline, but “wobbling” is dictionary English, so no  \n- murmurous (invented form)  \n- whorling  \n- snick-snap (variant of snicker-snack but novel form)  \n- frumious (borrowed from Carroll; canonical coinage)  \n- fieldling (invented)  \n- whimpering whirl (whimpering standard; whirl standard)  \nTotal distinct distinct coinages excluding canonical from Carroll: Stubblewisp, murmurous, whorling, snick-snap, fieldling = 5. “Frumious” is canonical. So total distinct coinages 5. Less than required ≥8. Criterion not met.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza contains at least one coinage:  \n- Stanza 1: stubblewisp, murmurous  \n- Stanza 2: frumious (canonical), winding idiom but mostly standard words  \n- Stanza 3: no obvious coinage besides rusted (standard)  \n- Stanza 4: whorling  \n- Stanza 5: snick-snap (onomatopoeia coinage)  \n- Stanza 6: none new, only standard words  \nThus not every stanza contains ≥1 coinage. Criterion not met.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: The \"murmurous Wisp\" or \"Wisp\" is the central non-canonical creature and acted upon. Criterion met.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"snick-snap\" in stanza 5, plus \"hissed\" in stanza 5 also counts as onomatopoeic burst. Two onomatopoeic bursts present. Criterion met.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance:  \n- Stanza 1: “wobbling ... where ... golden stubbles gleam and quake” - subtle but not strong alliteration  \n- Stanza 2: “wings do weave the wind’s own tongue”—clear repeated \"w\" sounds (alliteration)  \n- Stanza 5: “swung—yet missed!—with frantic flap” has within-line alliteration of 'f' and 'w'  \nAt least two stanzas with clear non-incidental alliteration/consonance. Criterion met.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Early warning (stanza 2), preparation (3), encounter (4), decisive action (5), then no slaying and no return/celebration. The order is preserved but the arc fails on decisive action and return. Does this disqualify? The criterion expects arc beats to appear in canonical order, so the first four are present in order, last two (decisive act and celebration) partially missing. Since decisive act missing (no slaying), arc is incomplete. Criterion requires full canonical order, so no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim line check: No line exactly matches any canonical poem line. Criterion met.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget ≤8 distinct tokens: only “frumious” and “snicker-snack” variant (snick-snap) clearly canonical but altered; no direct canonical tokens beyond \"beware\" and \"O\" as interjection (common English). Below threshold. Criterion met.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines mostly 8–9 syllables (e.g., stanza 1 line 1 = \"Beneath the wane of wobbling light\" (8 syllables), shorter lines mostly 5–7 (e.g., stanza 1 line 4 = \"A swirl, a sigh, a shiver’d wake\" (7 syllables). Across stanzas roughly consistent. Criterion met.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme pairs per stanza are all different words, no more than 2 stanza pairs repeat an ending word. Variety maintained. Criterion met.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overused beyond allowed threshold, no clear overuse. Criterion met.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Few coinages present (around 5 distinct roots), no single suffix dominates >50%. Criterion borderline but overall coinage roots distinct enough; no dominant suffix. Criterion met.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a similar theme to Jabberwocky with an invented creature (“Wisp”), struggle, and the original’s narrative structure (warning, quest, encounter). Topic adherence maintained. Criterion met.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem implies themes of futility and loss (protagonist fails, weapon dropped, empty field at end). Motif of harvest perhaps underlying. Coherent implied layer present.

Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: stanza 6 “He went galumphing back to her. ‘And hast thou slain the Murm’ration? Come to my arms… O frabjous day! Calloh! Callay!’ He chortled in his joyous tone.” Explicit jovial return and celebration. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages ≥8 distinct: Coinages present - “Murm’ration”, “brilling”, “skyflock”, “Avicoil”, “frumpled”, “skeyre”, “oofish”, “snicking”, “thwacked”, “wing-streaks”, “whirling drowse”. At least 8 distinct invented words definitely present. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains ≥1 coinage? Check each stanza:  \n1: brilling, skyflock  \n2: Murm’ration, Avicoil, frumpled  \n3: vorpal, skeyre, stagnant  \n4: Murm’ration, snicking, sallow  \n5: wing-streaks  \n6: galumphing, beamish, frabjous  \n7: hushen, whirling, drowse  \nAll stanzas include at least one coinage. Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central (not \"Jabberwock\"): “Murm’ration” named and central adversary the protagonist faces. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>At least 2 onomatopoeic bursts (exclamations or sound words)? “snicking” (imitating sound?) “thwacked” (impact sound), “galumphing” (invented word but also a sound/action), “wing-streaks flew” - more visual/action than onomatopoeia. No exclamations like “snicker-snack” or “hiss” or “pop”. Ambiguous but fewer outright onomatopoeic bursts or interjections. Two instances borderline: “snicking”, “thwacked” – can count as onomatopoeia as sound words. Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance ≥2 stanzas: Look for repeated consonants in lines:  \nStanza 1: \"starlings... twirled... stubble-flame\" strong 's' and 't' sounds.  \nStanza 2: \"jaws... whip... wings... bind\" ‘w’ and ‘b’ consonances.  \nStanza 4: “snicking… sallow” - alliteration.  \nAt least two stanzas show clear alliteration/consonance. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration:  \n2 warning (Beware)  \n3 preparation (taking beak, seeking, resting)  \n4 encounter (Murm’ration comes)  \n5 decisive act (killing)  \n6 return/celebration (joyful)  \nArc order is canonical. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: No direct verbatim reuse of Jabberwocky lines found; many coinages and rephrase. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens ≤8: canonical words such as “Beware”, “vorpal”, “frumious”, “beamish”, “galumphing”, “chortled”, “Callay” and “One, two! One, two!” - Some reused canonical words from the original poem, approx 7-8 distinct canonical tokens, borderline but acceptable. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines approx 8-9 syllables, shorter 5-7 syllables. Some lines follow pattern approximately (e.g. stanza 1 line 1 \"’Twas brilling\" (3 syllables) very short, line 2 \"and the starlings gyred\" (6) short; line 3 7-8 syllables; mismatch in consistency across stanzas. Only about half of lines fit expected syllable count range. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety across stanzas: rimes reused minimally; \"thought\" used multiple times but no end word repeated >2 times outside ring echo. Rhyme scheme varies enough. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no single content word overused >5 times or >8% outside ring echo. Checked \"Murm’ration\" used multiple times but it’s the adversary name, allowed. No sign of overuse otherwise. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety with ≥4 distinct roots (no suffix over 50%): roots “Murm’ration”, “brilling”, “skyflock”, “Avicoil”, “frumpled”, “skeyre”, “oofish”, “snicking”, “thwacked”, etc., diverse roots. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem addresses a new adversary named “Murm’ration” and imitates the structure and style of Jabberwocky, clearly fitting the topic of a Carroll-style nonsense poem with similar elements, so yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied layer: some undertone of order vs chaos suggested in last stanza (“They knew the sky was righted now… ceased to bow to chaos in its whirling drowse”). Implied motif of battle restoring order and the protagonist’s bravery is detectable.
