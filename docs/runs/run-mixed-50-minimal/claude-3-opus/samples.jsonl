New coinages or repurposed terms include \"Computable\", \"Hilbert tree\", \"Turing-Scratch\" (a compound not canonical but built from known words), \"time-bounds\", \"Polynomial\" and \"Nondeterministic\" are standard English/mathematical terms, not coined words. So distinct invented coinages (pure neologisms unrelated to known English or canonical) <8; mostly canonical or normal words.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage-like word: \"brillig\", \"gyre\", \"gimble\", \"mimsy\", \"outgrabe\", \"frumious\", \"tulgey\", \"uffish\", \"snicker-snack\", \"galumphing\", \"beamish\", all present in every stanza or spread well.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named besides “Jabberwock”: \"Polynomial\" and \"Nondeterministic bird\" are presented as adversaries; “Polynomial” is central to the action, figuratively as an enemy to be slain, so yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts present: “snicker-snack!” and “burbled” (used in Jabberwocky as onomatopoeic verb). So ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance obvious in at least two stanzas: e.g., “P and NP Did gyre and gimble”, “frumious Turing-Scratch”, “vorpal pen”, “Hilbert tree”, “whiffling through the tulgey wood” show notable repeated consonants.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc beats appear in canonical order: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive action → return/celebration, all clearly sequenced.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line exactly matches any canonical poem line verbatim; words reused but lines newly composed.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens count: uses ‘brillig’, ‘slithy’ (in first line?), ‘gyre’, ‘gimble’, ‘wabe’, ‘mimsy’, ‘outgrabe’, ‘frumious’, ‘tulgey’, ‘uffish’, ‘snicker-snack’, ‘galumphing’, and ‘beamish’. “Slithy” appeared in reference but model replaces with “P and NP”. “Brillig”, “gyre”, “gimble”, “wabe”, “mimsy”, “outgrabe”, “frumious”, “tulgey”, “uffish”, “snicker-snack”, “galumphing”, “beamish” used. That is >8 canonical tokens (more like 11-12). So canonical budget exceeds 8.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable pattern holds: longer lines mostly 8-9 syllables, shorter lines mostly 6-7 in nearly all stanzas; tight syllable control akin to Jabberwocky.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme word endings show good variety: \"wabe/outgrabe\", \"catch/Turing-Scratch\", \"sought/thought\", \"flame/came\", \"snicker-snack/back\", \"boy/joy\"; no single ending reused more than twice (only 'outgrabe' twice in opening and closing stanzas but allowed as ring echo). So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word excessively repeated outside ring echo; words like ‘Polynomial’, ‘brillig’, ‘gyre’ repeated about as expected; no content word >5 times or 8%.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages mostly from canonical roots or compound terms (Turing-Scratch, Hilbert tree) which are compound English; no evidence of ≥4 distinct roots purely coined with distinct roots beyond canonical lexicon; coinage variety borderline but due to heavy canonical usage and few new roots, does not meet variety threshold.</C22_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>", "judge_error": "worker_error: process_row() takes from 7 to 8 positional arguments but 9 were given"}

Scanning meter roughly: lines 1 & 3, 5 & 7, 9 & 11, etc. Lines 1 longer than 2? \"’Twas brillig, and the keywock clinked\" (7 syll), \"All mimsy were the keychains there.\" (7 syll), lines 1 and 2 similar length, no clear alternate pattern; another stanza \"He takes his vorpal keys in hand,\"(7–8 syll), \"Long time his master foe he seeks—\"(7 syll), 2nd line not notably shorter; many lines are similar length; no clear alternating short/long pattern shines through. Less than 60% stanzas meet alternate meter with >=2 content word difference: no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme check: in ≥60% of stanzas, lines 2 and 4 rhyme with possible slant rhyme and no AABB dominance. Examine rhyme pairs:  \nStanza 1: clinked / there – no rhyme; stanza 2: friend / snare – slant rhyme (end -end \"friend/snare\" moderate); stanza 3: hand/seeks – no rhyme; stanza 4: stood/came – no rhyme; stanza 5: through/snicker-snack – no rhyme (snicker-snack is compound onomatopoeia); stanza 6: dead/head – rhyme; stanza 7: boy/joy – rhyme.  \nOnly 3 stanzas have (2,4) rhyme (moderate to strong in 2nd, 6th, 7th stanzas). 3/7=42.9% <60%, so no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: final stanza echoes the opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases or refrain. Last stanza is the 7th quatrain: includes “beamish boy,” “Callooh! Callay!” which echoes canonical refrain from original poem, but the poem does not end with the same first stanza repeated or very close. The first stanza is about the \"keywock\" and \"keychains\"; last stanza addresses the “Janitor,” and rejoices, so no clear ring echo of opening stanza content words or full stanza refrain beyond canon items. No explicit repeated first stanza or refrain present. No.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition: second stanza is “Beware the Janitor, my friend! The locks that catch, the doors that snare!” which is a clear caution-like admonition. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: before encounter, protagonist prepares (tool/resolve/waits/plans). Third stanza: “He takes his vorpal keys in hand, Long time his master foe he seeks— So rested he by the Doorknob tree, And stood awhile in thought.” Clear preparation and waiting. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: fourth stanza: “And, as in uffish thought he stood, The Janitor, with locks aflame, Came whiffling through the checkered wood, And clattered as he came!” Clear encounter between protagonist and foe. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: fifth stanza: “One, two! One, two! And through and through The vorpal keys went snicker-snack! He left them dead, and with their head He went galumphing back.” There is a decisive act resolving tension (killing Janitor). Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: sixth stanza: “And hast thou slain the Janitor? Come to my arms, my beamish boy! O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!” He chortled in his joy.” Clear jubilant acknowledgement, return. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct coinages (invented words, not canonical or standard English). Coinages: keywock, keychains, Janitor (common English noun, but capitalized as a named creature, somewhat canonical unusual), checkered (not coinage), clinked (standard English), Doorknob tree (compound), uffish (canonical), galumphing (canonical), snicker-snack (canonical), beamish (canonical).  \nNew non-canonical coined words: keywock, keychains, Doorknob (compound, could count?), checkered not coinage, Janitor capitalized used as antagonist. Probably 2-3 coinages: keywock, keychains, Doorknob tree; Janitor arguably creature-name, but English common noun; not enough ≥8 distinct coinages. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Does each stanza contain ≥1 coinage? Some stanzas contain canonical words (uffish, galumphing), others plain English; for example, stanza 3 has “vorpal keys,” “master foe,” “Doorknob tree” (coinage); stanza 2 has “locks that catch,” “doors that snare” (standard words), stanza 4 has “Janitor, locks aflame,” “checkered wood” (checkered likely not coinage); some stanzas appear to lack distinct coinage, e.g., last stanza lacks coinage, mostly canonical. Not all stanzas have a coinage. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named & central: “Janitor” capitalized is clearly focal foe. The “keywock” in title is named and mentioned in opening, but not further described or focal in action; “Janitor” is the central adversary. Janitor is an English word, but used uniquely here; judged as a named creature entity, yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia ≥2 bursts: “snicker-snack!” in stanza 5; “clattered” stanza 4 is close, but not really onomatopoeic burst; only one clear “snicker-snack!” phrase. No other clear bursts like “Pop!” or “Hiss!” only “clattered” (less bursty). Only one clear onomatopoeia burst. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas:  \nStanza 1 “brillig” and “keywock clinked” (k sound), stanza 2 “locks that catch, the doors that snare” (soft but some s/c sounds); stanza 5 “vorpal keys went snicker-snack!” (s/k sounds). At least two stanzas (1 and 5) have clear alliteration. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning/admonition → preparation → encounter → slaying → return/celebration  \nYes, stanza 2 is warning, stanza 3 preparation, stanza 4 encounter, stanza 5 slaying, stanza 6 return/celebration; perfectly canonical order confirmed. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines matching canonical poem. Some canonical phrases like “’Twas brillig, and,” “And stood awhile in thought,” and “One, two! One, two!”, but no exact full line verbatim copying. Mostly close paraphrase. No exact matched line found exactly as in original. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens ≤8: The poem uses “’Twas brillig,” “uffish,” “vorpal,” “snicker-snack,” “galumphing,” “beamish,” “Callooh! Callay!” which are canonical; also “mimsy” once; about 7-8 canonical words total, within limit. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines ≈8–9 syllables, shorter lines ≈5–7 syllables approximately, alternating. Sample:  \nLine 1 “’Twas brillig, and the keywock clinked” ~7 syll (a bit short), line 2 “All mimsy were the keychains there.” ~7 syll (not shorter),  \nLine 3 “He takes his vorpal keys in hand,” ~7 syll, line 4 “Long time his master foe he seeks—” ~7 syll, not clearly alternating shorter/longer with strong difference. Overall, syllable counts hover near 7 without clear longer/shorter alternation. Not tight or canonical pattern. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes vary across stanzas. Rhymes are sparse, roughly friend/snare (stanza 2), dead/head (stanza 6), boy/joy (stanza7), less variety overall, but no end word reused >2 times. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no content word is repeated excessively; “the” and common words present, “Janitor” repeated 3-4 times but not >5 or >8%. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: only 3-4 coinages total (keywock, keychains, Doorknob tree compound); coinages do not show >4 distinct roots; no diversity. No.</C22_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>", "judge_error": "worker_error: process_row() takes from 7 to 8 positional arguments but 9 were given"}
