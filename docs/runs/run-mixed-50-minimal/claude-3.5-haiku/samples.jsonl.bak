Ambiguous but leaning towards no since \"every quatrain stanza\" strictness. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: End rhymes for lines 2 & 4 are keep/leap, might/light, pale/veil, friend/extend. These are four distinct rhymes, no re-use >2.

Mostly normal language.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order of beats warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return.  \nWarning (stanza 3) present but no preparation, no encounter, no decisive act, no return/celebration.

Pattern not well matched. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) end-rhymes varied, no end word reused >2 times?  \n(2,4) rhymes mostly unique, no overuse of rhyme words.

Topic may be poetic but departs from classic Jabberwocky themes and creatures. So partially, but probably no per strict criteria.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Is there a coherent implied layer or motif detectable?  \nSome atmosphere about urban power, electricity, danger under city, a cautionary mood about dangerous electricity—some implied undertone of urban menace or energy.
