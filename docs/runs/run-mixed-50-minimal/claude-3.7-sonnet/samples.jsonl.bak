Callay! / He chortled in his joy,\" indicating celebration after the encounter.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Coined words include Murmlebirds, flarn, tulgy, swoopend, kaleidoscoped (used N.E.), stubbly (arguably English), gloam (known archaic English), plumey, murmlation, blackness cloaked (English), so at least 8 distinct invented or novel coinages occur (Murmlebirds, flarn, swoopend, tulgy (variant of tulgey but misspelled?), kaleidoscoped, murmlation, plumey, stubbly (borderline but likely accepted). Some are borderline or known English but overall coinage count looks adequate.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage or novel coined word (e.g., Murmlation, stubble, flarn, tum-tum, tulgy, murmllebirds, kaleidoscoped, plumey), satisfying spread across all stanzas.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Central creature/entity named: \"Murmlebirds\" is a clearly non-canonical named creature, central to the poem's conflict and action (not Jabberwock).</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: There is \"whiffling,\" \"burbled,\" but no clear onomatopoeic bursts like \"snicker-snack,\" \"Pop!\", or \"Hiss!\"—only \"whiffling\" and \"burbled\" which are canonical but little else. Two onomatopoeic bursts required; only one clear Canonical burst \"burbled\" and \"whiffling\" which are verbs describing sounds, but no exclamations or bursts, thus borderline but probably no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Some internal consonance and alliteration like \"withered yields,\" \"winged throng,\" \"flarn husks\" but not prominently or clearly in ≥2 stanzas beyond incidental repeats.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The poem follows canonical arc beats in order—warning, preparation, encounter, decisive action, return/celebration—matching the original Jabberwocky arc.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: Lines are reworded or changed; no exact canonical lines are copied verbatim except the ring stanza, which is allowed. The ring stanza is from the model poem and closely echoes original but no direct line verbatim outside ring.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical vocabulary is limited: Only a few canonical words reused (brillig, mimsy, gyre, gimble, wabe, mome, tum-tum variant, uffish, whiffling, burbled, beamish, frumious (from canonical)) — count is around or less than 8 distinct canonical tokens, favoring new coinages.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines near 8–9 syllables, shorter lines near 5–7 syllables in majority of stanzas, e.g., stanza 1 longer lines \"’Twas brillig, and the stubble fields\" (7 syllables), \"Did gyre and gimble in the gloam\" (8 syllables), shorter lines \"All mimsy were the withered yields\" (7 syllables), \"And the flarn husks did moan\" (6 syllables) generally meet needed patterns across most stanzas.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: End rhyme words in positions (2,4) vary across stanzas; no single rhyme repeated more than twice (e.g. gloam/moan; blend/swoopend; thought/watched; sound/wound; joy/Callay), so rhyme variety is acceptable.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word overused >5 times or >8% of content words, no repeated heavy terms except allowed canonical or coinages repeated as part of arc.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages have at least 4 distinct roots: Murmle-birds, flarn, swoop-end, tul-gy, kaleido-scoped, murm-lation, plum-ey, stubb-ly, so no single suffix or root dominates over 50%.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-like topic (encounter with strange creatures called Murmlebirds), closely related in style and subject, no substitution of unrelated subject.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is some subtle subtext about observing and confronting a confusing or blending threat (Murmlebirds) in a twilight landscape, perhaps metaphor for facing uncertainty, giving a faint but coherent implied undertone beyond surface action.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Counting stanzas: 8 stanzas total (matching the reference). All 4 lines each. Stanza count within 5-8, so yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter echo: Checking line length alternation per stanza; \"Jabberwocky\" uses alternating longer (~8-9 syllables) and shorter (~5-7) lines in a quatrain. Here, many lines echo that pattern but some stanzas (e.g., first stanza, line 2 and 3) seem close in length, so borderline. However, 5 or more stanzas seem to have clear alternating longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content-word difference. Counted 6/8 stanzas meet this clearly, so yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme: In ≥60% of stanzas, lines 2 and 4 rhyme or slant rhyme (allowing slant rhyme). The poem uses exact and near rhymes (e.g., \"catch\"/\"Bandersnatch\", \"flame\"/\"came\", \"snicker‑snack\"/\"back\"). Also the rhyme scheme is not dominated by AABB but mostly ABAB or ABCB type, so yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza clearly echoes the first stanza with ≥2 repeated content words or phrases (\"’Twas brillig,\" \"Did gyre and gimble,\" \"All blimsy,\" \"The mome raths outswayed\" echoes \"mome raths outgrabe\"). So yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning admonition: There is a stanza early on with a direct admonition - \"Beware the Skrimbleforth, my son!\" and further warnings, so yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation armament: Protagonist takes \"vorpal wrench in hand,\" and \"long time the blueish foe he sought,\" resting by the Tumtum tree and standing in thought, matching preparation before encounter; so yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter confrontation: A clear encounter occurs: \"And as in uffish thought he stood, The Skrimbleforth... came whiffling...\" so yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying decisive action: The decisive action is the \"vorpal wrench went snicker-snack!\" and \"He left it dead, and with its head,\" clearly a resolution, so yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return celebration: The return is described with \"He went galumphing back,\" and jubilant words \"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\" and \"He chortled in his joy,\" so yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Count distinct invented words not canonical or standard English. New coinages: screwish, torp, blimsy, bluingborps, outswayed, Skrimbleforth, Snatchit, blueish (borderline English?), snicker-snack (canonical), gyre (canonical), gimble (canonical), etc. Excluding canonical and standard English, distinct new coinages are: screwish, torp, blimsy, bluingborps, outswayed, Skrimbleforth, Snatchit - about 7. \"Blueish\" is standard English (a word). So fewer than 8 distinct coined words; no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza must contain ≥1 coined word. Checking each stanza: \n1st stanza: screwish, torp, blimsy, bluingborps, outswayed (coinages present)\n2nd: Skrimbleforth, Snatchit, frumious Bandersnatch (frumious, Bandersnatch canonical, Snatchit coined)\n3rd: vorpal wrench (vorpal canonical), blueish foe (blueish standard English)\n4th: uffish (canonical), Skrimbleforth (named)\n5th: snicker-snack (canonical)\n6th: galumphing (canonical)\n7th: frabjous (canonical)\n8th: screwish, torp, blimsy, bluingborps, outswayed repeated\n\nAt least 7 stanzas have at least one coinage. The 3rd stanza's \"blueish\" is not coinage, but \"vorpal\" canonical is. So one could debate 3rd stanza lacks clearly new coinage, but presence of canonical is not enough. If canonical is insufficient, 3rd stanza lacks coinage. So coinage in 7/8 stanzas (87.5%), yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: The named non-canonical creature is \"Skrimbleforth\", central to the poem's action, so yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Presence of \"snicker-snack!\" is canonical, one instance. Another onomatopoeia (\"burbled\") is verbal but more a verb than burst/impact. No clear ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts; others are verb forms or descriptive but not onomatopoeic bursts. So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration consonance: Checking for strong alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats in ≥2 stanzas. Examples: \"screwish\", \"snicker‑snack\", \"Skrimbleforth\" have sibilants; \"threads that grip, the turns that catch\" would be good but line missing here. This poem mirrors original lines mostly; lacks some strong alliteration beyond canonical. Some alliteration: \"Skrimbleforth\" and \"snicker-snack\" in stanza 5, also initial 'b' in stanza 1 with \"bluingborps\" and \"blimsy\". So yes, at least 2 stanzas have clear alliteration.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration in canonical order is respected; the poem follows original order, so yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: Checking carefully, some lines do match exactly with canonical (\"’Twas brillig, and the ...\", \"Did gyre and gimble in the ...\", \"One, two! One, two! And through and through\", \"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\" etc.). This disqualifies yes for no verbatim lines; no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget ≤8: Counting distinct canonical tokens: brillig, slithy, toves, gyre, gimble, wabe/glade (wabe replaced by glade), mome, raths, outgrabe/outswayed (changed). Others: vorpal, manxome/blueish, uffish, whiffling, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish, frumious, Bandersnatch, Tumtum, Jubjub (here Jubjub replaced by Snatchit). The poem uses about 10 or more canonical tokens or their close variants; more than 8 tokens used. So no.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Testing longer lines (~8-9 syllables) and shorter (~5-7) in each quatrain. The poem strongly matches original pattern syllable counts closely. Most longer lines hit ~8 syllables, shorter lines around 6 or 7. So yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) end-rhymes are mostly varied stanza by stanza: \"glade/catch\", \"catch/Bandersnatch\", \"hand/sought\", \"stood/flame/came/came\", repeated rhymes exist but no exact repetition of (2,4) more than twice across stanzas; yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: Aside from ring composition words, no content word is overused more than 5x or 8% of content words. \"the\" or \"and\" are function words, allowed. Repetition of \"Skrimbleforth\" is necessary. No other content words overused excessively. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages show multiple distinct roots, e.g. screwish, torp, blimsy, bluingborps, outswayed, Skrimbleforth, Snatchit; suffixes like -ish, -s, -ed used. No single suffix accounts for >50%. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly uses the Jabberwocky theme and style with a new creature, so topic is matched; yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Similar to 'Jabberwocky', with implied themes of caution, heroism, and victory through the narrative arc; consistent undertone present; yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

The poem uses about 8 or fewer distinct canonical tokens (brillig, mimsy, frumious, vorpal, manxome, uffish, whiffling, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, beamish) with some substitutions like “galumphed” is a variant.

Around 7 or 8. Burr is general English but here used as a name. Conservatively about 8 distinct coinages or coined compounds (slurry-bird, splattersnatch, scrimblate, whizzle, slurrifying, slurry-tree). Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains ≥1 coinage: check quickly - Title stanza has \"honing burrs\" (coinage?), yes.

No overused rhymes. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No single content word overused >5 times or >8% of content words, outside ring echo. Words like \"burr\" repeated 4-5 times but not exceeding threshold.

Borderline but counting canonical tokens like “brillig,” “mome,” “mimsy,” “vorpal,” “manxome,” “Tumtum,” “whiffling,” “burbled,” “snicker-snack,” “galumphing,” “beamish,” “chortled,” “callooh,” “callay” — more than 8 distinct canonical tokens are present.
