Stanza count 8 is within 5-8 requirement and all stanzas have 4 lines.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Inspect meter: Pattern of alternating longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content-word difference in ≥60% of stanzas. Some variation present but not all stanzas show clear ballad meter alternation. For instance, some lines vary less. Less than 60% clearly fit ballad meter.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme pattern: In ≥60% of stanzas, lines 2 and 4 rhyme or have slant rhyme, and no strong AABB dominance. Majority use (2,4) rhyme (e.g., walls/sight, sought/thought, flame/came, snicker-snack/back), with some variety; AABB not dominant. So this criterion is met.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza repeats the opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases: \"’Twas brillig in the furnish'd hall,\" repeated exactly, plus \"reglets gimbled\", \"gyre\", \"frumious\" words appear. Clear ring composition with repeated first stanza at the end.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition: Yes, stanza 2 contains \"Beware the Reglet-beast, my son! ... Beware ... shun\" which is an admonition to the protagonist, matching original's warning style.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: Protagonist takes \"measureful rule in hand,\" and \"rested ... and stood awhile in thought\" before the encounter — consistent with preparation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: Yes, a clear meeting/confrontation line: \"The Reglet-beast, with drawers of flame, / Came whiffling through the oaken wood,\" matching a direct encounter.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action that resolves central tension: \"One, two!

Examples: Regletous, reglets, gimbled, frumious, Reglet-beast, measureful, Chiffonier (borrowed French but arguably coinage here), Davenportish. Approximately 8 or more distinct words seem invented or transformed, passing threshold.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza contains at least one coined word, e.g. stanza 1 (\"reglets\", \"gimbled\", \"frumious\"), stanza 2 (\"Reglet-beast\", \"frumious\", \"Davenportish\"), stanza 3 (\"measureful\", \"maple\"), etc. All stanzas have at least one coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>A non-canonical creature/entity named and central: \"Reglet-beast\" is named and is the adversary; not canonical like Jabberwock, so yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts: Contains \"snicker-snack!\" like original, and whiffling and burbled (canonical, onomatopoeic). At least 2 onomatopoeic bursts present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeat in ≥2 stanzas: Examples like \"reglets gimbled\", \"measured rule\", \"whiffling through the wood\" show clear alliteration/consonance in multiple stanzas.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning admonition → preparation → encounter → decisive action → return and celebration appear in correct canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: Some exact lines from original copied, e.g., last stanza repeats first stanza with only small changes (\"’Twas brillig in the furnish'd hall\" vs \"’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\"). So not fully verbatim canonical lines, but is the repeated stanza considered verbatim? It's changed enough with coinages; no exact canonical lines reused, so yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexicon usage ≤8 distinct canonical tokens: Poem uses canonical words like \"brillig\", \"gyre\", \"gimble(d)\", \"wabe\" replaced with hall/wood equivalents, \"beamish\", \"snicker-snack\", \"whiffling\", \"burbled\", \"frumious.\" Count roughly ≤8 canonical tokens, mostly replaced or altered appropriately.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines ~8-9 syllables, shorter lines ~5-7 syllables in every stanza. Most longer lines close to 8-9 syllables; shorter lines generally 6 syllables. Pattern consistent across most quatrains.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes mostly varied across stanzas, no single rhyming end word reused more than twice excluding ring echo stanza; rhyme pairs are distinct mostly. Passes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word (outside refrain) overused beyond 5 times or 8% content words. Repeated coinages and words are spread; no excessive overload.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages show diverse roots: \"reglet\", \"gimble\", \"frumious\", \"Davenportish\", \"measureful\", \"Chiffonier\", \"maple\", \"oaken.\" No single suffix accounts for over 50% of coinages; variety present.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Clearly addresses a creature/encounter in a \"Jabberwocky\"-style poem focusing on the “Reglet-beast” and household/furniture theme consistent with Jabberwocky’s style and topic.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: A coherent implied layer of domestic fears or furniture animism is apparent; undertone of a child facing wild furniture creatures; subtle, consistent motif across the poem.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}
