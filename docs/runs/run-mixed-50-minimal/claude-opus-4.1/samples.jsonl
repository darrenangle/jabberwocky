Confirmed coinage in all stanzas.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named a non-canonical creature: Slurrywock central to action, distinct from canonical Jabberwock. Additionally, Burrbub bird (analogous to Jubjub) and Honerite (analogous to Bandersnatch) appear.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"snicker-snack!\" in stanza 5; \"burbling\" and \"gurgled\" in stanza 4 act as mild onomatopoeic bursts. \"snicker-snack\" canonical, but \"burbling\" and \"gurgled\" convey sound explicitly. Meets ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Noticeable alliteration and consonance: \"Did grind and grittle in the slade\" (stanza 1), \"whetful blade\" (3,5), \"stood awhile in thought,\" \"sharpish boy\" (6). At least two stanzas with clear alliteration/consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc beats in canonical order: warning (2), preparation (3), encounter (4), decisive act (5), return/celebration (6) occur sequentially as required.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines are exact verbatim matches from the canonical poem aside from the opening and closing stanzas which seem repeated verbatim. Since the ring echo stanza is allowed to repeat, otherwise no verbatim canonical lines. Inside stanzas, all lines altered sufficiently.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used are limited to those in original poem and reused sparingly (\"brillig,\" \"mimsy,\" \"mome,\" \"uffish,\" \"galumphing,\" \"snicker-snack,\" \"beamish,\" \"frumious\"). The total canonical distinct tokens is ≤8.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Line syllables roughly match Jabberwocky’s syllable pattern with alternating ~8-9 and 5-7 syllables for longer and shorter lines. Checked several stanzas conform well.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety good: end rhymes exhibit variation; no single rhyme reused more than 2 times except ring echo stanza. Different rhyme endings in “-ade,” “-ite,” “-ock,” “-park,” “-ay” appear diverse.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition controlled; aside from repeated ring echo stanza, no content word seems overused (none >5 times or >8% of total content words). Distribution looks balanced.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety strong with at least slurry, burr, hone, grit, slurry-spurs, honerite, burbling/gurgled, slade, slurrish roots. No single suffix >50% of coinages. ≥4 distinct roots evident.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: clearly maintaining the narrative of a Jabberwocky-style poem about Slurrywock and its slurring environment, matching the theme and style, no off-topic elements.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is an implied motif of struggle and mastery over a harsh or \"slurry\" environment, with words evoking grinding, honing, and oil, suggesting thematic undertones of resilience and sharpening oneself, consistent across poem.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}
