Pattern generally matches ballad meter.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>End rhymes in lines (2,4) occur in ≥60% of stanzas with mostly varied rhyme pairs. No AABB dominance; mostly ABXB or ABCB rhyme schemes present.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza echoes the opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words (\"’Twas brillig\", \"leathern hides\", \"gyre and gimble\", \"mimsy\", \"awl-beast\" \"ker-plop\") forming a clear ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Second stanza contains the clear admonition “Beware the Awlbock, my son! ... Beware the Bradawl bird, and shun...”, matching the warning/admonition style of the original poem.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>The protagonist takes his “vorpal awl in hand” and “long time the leathsome foe he sought” and “rested he ... and stood awhile in thought,” indicating preparation before confrontation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter described in stanza 4: “And, as in uffish thought he stood, The Awlbock, with its eye of steel, Came piercing... and punctured...” indicating a meeting and confrontation.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action is presented in stanza 5: “One, two! One, two! And through and through The vorpal awl went snicker-snack! He left it dead...” similar to the original decisive slaying act.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration in stanza 6: “And hast thou slain the Awlbock? Come to my arms, my beamish boy! O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! He chortled in his joy.” consistent with the original celebratory return.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages here are fewer than the original canonical set. New words: Awlsome, leathern, cobblersides, Awlbock, Bradawl, Stitcherpeak, leathsome (variant), Workbench tree, awl-beast, ker-plop, punctured as it wheel’d. Counting distinct invented coinages (non-canonical, non-standard English): Awlsome, leathern/leathsome (count as variant), cobblersides, Awlbock, Bradawl, Stitcherpeak, Workbench tree (compound?), awl-beast, ker-plop, wheel’d (possibly standard dialect contraction?), “punctured” is normal word. So about 7–9 coinages depending on judgment. Probably just under 8 distinct innovative coinages, as leathern(leathsome) is variant, Workbench tree is more descriptive compound; ker-plop is onomatopoeic coinage.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza appears to contain at least one coinage or nonce word: leathern hides, cobblersides, awl-beast, Awlbock, Bradawl, Stitcherpeak, Workbench tree, ker-plop. Spread of coinages throughout, so yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named non-canonical creatures/entities: Awlbock (central adversary), Bradawl bird, Stitcherpeak, awl-beast (mentioned in opening and closing). Awlbock is a named, central non-canonical creature.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: “ker-plop” in opening and closing stanzas, “snicker-snack” in decisive act stanza, also “punctured as it wheel’d!” implies metallic sound but less clear. At least two (ker-plop, snicker-snack) onomatopoeic bursts.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance visible in multiple stanzas: “vorpal awl”, “beeamish boy”, “stitcherpeak” with “stab”, “snicker-snack”, “leathsome foe he sought”. At least 2 stanzas have clear and strong alliteration/consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Tone is playful, whimsical and mythic, matching Jabberwocky style rather than any promotional or flat style.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines from original Jabberwocky are copied exactly, though structure and some words reused, lines are rewritten or replaced (e.g. “The Awlsome” instead of original title). “’Twas brillig, and the leathern hides / Did gyre and gimble in the shop” is a variant, not verbatim.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens from original are used sparingly: “brillig”, “gyre”, “gimble”, “mimsy”, “frumious”, “beamish”, “uffish”, “snicker-snack”, “galumphing”, “Callooh! Callay!” appear. Over 8 canonical tokens appear, but some are repeated. The poem keeps classic Jabberwocky lexicon but with additions - count is borderline but likely ≤8 distinct canonical tokens (brillig, gyre, gimble, mimsy, frumious, beamish, uffish, snicker-snack, galumphing, Callooh! Callay! are more than 8). So canonical token count slightly above 8. So no.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllables count per line roughly matches Jabberwocky’s pattern of about 8-9 syllables for longer lines and 5-7 syllables for shorter lines in quatrains. Example: “’Twas brillig, and the leathern hides” (7 syllables?), “Did gyre and gimble in the shop:” (7 syllables?), Some lines may be slightly short, but generally syllable count matches the original pattern closely.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: 2,4 rhymes vary stanza to stanza; no heavy repetition of same rhymes or end words. No end word reused >2 times apart from ring echo stanzas (the first and last). Variety preserved.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word is overused beyond threshold; instance words like “awl”, “Awlbock”, “leathern” used but repetition is moderate and does not exceed 5 times or 8% of content words.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages roots show at least 4 distinct roots: “Awl-” (Awlbock, awl-beast), “Bradawl”, “Stitcherpeak”, “cobbler-”, “leathern/leathsome”, “Workbench”. This spreads coinages over multiple distinct roots avoiding >50% from single suffix.</C22_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>"}
