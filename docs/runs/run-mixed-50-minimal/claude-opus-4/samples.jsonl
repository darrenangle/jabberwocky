Estimated coinages: \"graphly,\" \"cycle-snatch,\" \"Floyd-bird,\" \"Bellman-Ford\" (used as coinages), \"greedy\" is dictionary but used as coinage of sword name, possibly borderline. Counting: at least 4-5. The poem fails to reach 8 distinct invented coinages distinct from canonical or standard English. So, no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage? Some stanzas (like last echo stanza) rely on canonical or standard English; not every stanza contains a unique coined word. E.g., \"Dijkstra\" appears in stanza 5 only, \"Bellman-Ford\" stanza 2 only. Not all stanzas have coinages. So no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named and central, but is the named creature non-canonical and not 'Jabberwock'? The poem replaces the Jabberwock with entities like \"Floyd-bird,\" \"Bellman-Ford,\" and \"Dijkstra\" (the latter personified). \"Dijkstra\" is the protagonist, so the adversary names are \"Bellman-Ford\" and \"Floyd-bird,\" but these are algorithmic references rather than creatures. The adversary here is \"Bellman-Ford\" and \"Floyd-bird\" (parody of named creatures). The \"Dijkstra\" is the hero. The poem's dynamic is a bit unclear whether these are creatures or objects, but the \"Floyd-bird\" and \"Bellman-Ford\" are portrayed as adversaries, matching criteria for creature/entity named and central to action (with \"Floyd-bird\" as a creature analog). So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Contains \"snicker-snack!\" and \"whiffling,\" \"burbled\" which are canonical onomatopoeic bursts. \"Snicker-snack\" counts as onomatopoeic burst; \"whiffling\" and \"burbled\" are more descriptive but count towards onomatopoeia.

Only \"Sprezzaturous/Sprezzature\" new coinages clearly invented. The poem reuses many canonical coinages, only 1 or 2 new. Distinct new coinages <8 - no</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza has at least one coinage? Most stanzas contain canonical nonce words, but probably only the first stanza and admonition use a new coinage (\"Sprezzaturous\", \"Sprezzature\") which do reoccur.

So no, not each stanza has a new coinage - no</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named and central to action: The “Sprezzature” as adversary is named and central.

Possibly not strong beyond incidental. The alliteration is modest; borderline but probably no clear strong alliteration beyond incidental in 2 stanzas - no</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The beats appear in canonical order - warning (stanza 2), preparation (3), encounter (4), decisive act (6), return (7). Correct order - yes</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: The poem reuses some canonical lines verbatim or nearly verbatim from Jabberwocky, e.g. \"'Twas brillig, and the …\", “He took his … in hand; Long time … he sought— So rested he by the Tumtum tree, And stood awhile in thought.” and the ending ring stanza.

Most stanzas appear to meet reasonable syllable tightness - yes</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: End-rhymes in (2,4) positions vary across stanzas; e.g., ease/please, catches/attaches, sought/thought, blithe/scythe, snicker-snack/back, joy/joy (repeated), please/please. “joy” repeats twice (stanza 7 and 8?), the last stanza repeats first stanza exactly so echo allowed to repeat rhyme: no exact rhyme reused >2 times outside ring echo. Rhyme variety passes - yes</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: Outside ring echo, no word seems overused excessively; 'the' and short function words excluded; no content word >5 times or >8% content words. \"Sprezzature\" appears ~5 times but it is a main creature name allowed. Other words no excessive repetition. So yes</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Only 1-2 invented roots (Sprezzaturous, Sprezzature) distinct. Most coinages are canonical or English.
