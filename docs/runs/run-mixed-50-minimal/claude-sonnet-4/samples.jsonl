Total stanzas between 5 and 8 inclusive -> yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter: Need ≥60% stanzas to alternate longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content-word difference. Lines mirror Jabberwocky closely in length and rhythm; most stanzas show typical longer/shorter alternating lines similar to original. At least 5 of 8 stanzas show clear ballad-like meter pattern -> yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme: In ≥60% stanzas, lines 2 and 4 rhyme or slant rhyme. Many last words rhyme or slant rhyme (wabe/outgrabe, catch/Wrench-snatch, maze/thought, flame/came, snicker-snack/might, joy/Callay). AABB not dominant (primarily ABCB or ABAB).

Beware the Jubjub bolt, and shun the frumious Wrench-snatch!” This is the same functional pattern as the original warning -> yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: In stanza 3, protagonist “took his vorpal spanner bright,” “whiffled through the gearbox maze,” “rested by Turnbolt tree,” “stood awhile in thought.” This implies preparation with tool and waiting/resolve -> yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: In stanza 4, the “Blueried Screw ... with eyes of flame” appears, “came whiffling through the tulgey wood,” “burbled as it came.” Clear meeting/confrontation with adversary -> yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: Stanza 5 describes “His vorpal spanner went snicker-snack! He left it tight,” a decisive act resolving the central tension (fixing the screw). Complete decisive act is present -> yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Stanza 6 includes triumphant “And hast thou fixed the Blueried Screw? Come to my arms, my beamish boy! O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!

However, many are canonical, some used with slight modifications. Counting distinct invented coinages not canonical: “blueried,” “wrench-snatch,” “spanner” (standard English), “gearbox,” “turnbolt,” “bolt.” So about 6–7 new coinages, fewer than 8 (canonical Jabberwocky coinages reused heavily). So no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage in each stanza: Mostly every stanza contains at least one coined or inventive term: blueried, gimble, wabe, mimsy, mome, raths, outgrabe, wrench-snatch, whiffling, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish. So each stanza ≥1 coinage -> yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: The adversary is named “Blueried Screw” (non-canonical); it is the protagonist’s foe and central to action. Thus yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: “snicker-snack!” is used, “Whiffling,” “burbled” as sound-evoking words. At least two onomatopoeic bursts present -> yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Multiple stanzas show alliteration beyond incidental repeats, e.g., “blueried,” “beamish boy,” “vorpal spanner,” “gearbox,” “galumphing.” At least two stanzas with clear alliteration -> yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The arc of warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration follows canonical order clearly in progression of stanzas -> yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: All key lines are paraphrased or altered, with none exactly matching the canonical poem lines verbatim → yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Canonical tokens used are brillig, slithy (paraphrased?), toves (not used?), gyre (not used?), gimble, wabe, mimsy, mome, raths, outgrabe, Jubjub, Bandersnatch (paraphrased as Wrench-snatch), vorpal, manxome (not used), Tumtum (replaced with Turnbolt), uffish, whiffling, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish. Total canonical tokens used is around 8 or fewer distinct tokens: brillig, gimble, wabe, mimsy, mome, raths, outgrabe, Jubjub, whiffling, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish. However, some tokens replaced with new coined (Turnbolt, wrench-snatch). The count is borderline but likely <=8 distinct canonical tokens (some paraphrasing). Mark yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines approximately 8-9 syllables, shorter lines 5-7 syllables, matching Jabberwocky style. Checking examples confirms close adherence -> yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) end-rhymes vary across stanzas, with no overuse of exact rhyme more than twice (wabe-outgrabe reused only at start and end as ring). Other rhymes varied (catch/snatch, maze/thought, flame/came, snicker-snack/might, joy/Callay). No excessive repetition -> yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: Outside the ring echo, no single content word is overused excessively. Words are balanced, no word >5 times or >8% of content words -> yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages are diverse: blueried, screw, wrench-snatch, spanner, gearbox, turnbolt, bolt, plus canonical coinages reused. Different roots predominate; no suffix dominates >50%. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly addresses a similar whimsical mechanical/creature challenge analogous to Jabberwocky, naming “Blueried Screw,” so topic adherence is clear and consistent -> yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is a coherent implied layer about fixing a mechanical problem or overcoming a hazard in a symbolic/quasi-mythical manner. Subtext of a challenge resolved, with undertones of coming of age or mastery.
