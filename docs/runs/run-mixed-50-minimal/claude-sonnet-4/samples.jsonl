Thus, each stanza contains canonical coinages, but new coinages only in a few stanzas.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: The Splicenwock is a new creature name (non-canonical), replacing Jabberwock, central to the poem's action.

Also, multiple lines like \"And stood awhile in thought.\", \"Came whiffling through the tulgey wood\" are verbatim or near-verbatim with minor substitutions. Checking if any line exactly matches canonical poem without change - yes, some exact lines are repeated verbatim (\"And stood awhile in thought.\", \"One, two! One, two! And through and through\").

Content words are varied. No single word notably overused beyond threshold – yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages come from at least 4 distinct roots: missive (Missivejaw, Missivejaw), cedar (cedar-raths, cedar-boxed), letter (letterwrites, Lettersnatch), outgroke, tulgy (variant of tulgey). No single suffix accounts for >50% coins – yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem is a clear Jabberwocky-style poem focused on a \"Missivejaw\" (likely a metaphorically letter-related creature), matching topic to the source poem style and content theme – yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/motif presence: The poem retains a surreal, mythical tone with an implied motif about written messages or letters as dangerous/threatening entities, consistent across poem – yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}
