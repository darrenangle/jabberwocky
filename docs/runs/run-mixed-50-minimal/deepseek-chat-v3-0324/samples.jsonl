First stanza has Keyblink, Jangle-jing; second has clink-clank; third has plinkish; fourth clatter-wood, slink; fifth clatter clash, twinkly wink; sixth no new coinage (beamish canonical); seventh repeated from first stanza. So all except maybe the celebratory stanza have coinages. 6 of 7 stanzas have coinages, the celebration stanza only canonical terms. 6/7 is ~86% > 60% needed - yes</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: Non-canonical creature named and central: \"Keyblink\" (and also \"Jangle-jing\" mentioned). Keyblink is central antagonist. Jangle-jing less central but named - yes</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"One-two! One-two!\" and \"clatter clash!\" are onomatopoeic bursts. Also \"whiffling\" and \"burbled\" are canonical onomatopoeia but reused here. At least two onomatopoeic bursts present - yes</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Examples: \"clink-clank\", \"clatter clash\", \"jingle spent\" show clear alliteration beyond incidental. Also \"plinks\" and \"slink\" close in third stanza. At least 2 stanzas with clear alliteration - yes</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning first, then preparation (took ring, thinking), encounter (Keyblink arriving), decisive action (battle), return/celebration (joyful chortling), ring echo (last stanza) follow canonical story arc order correctly - yes</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: Some canonical words reused, e.g. \"Beware the ... my son\", \"whiffling\", \"burbled\", \"beamish\", \"callooh! callay!\" but no lines exactly match canonical poem's lines verbatim (words rearranged, new names used). So no verbatim whole lines - yes</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Count distinct canonical tokens ≤8. Canonical tokens present: beware, my, son, frumious, stood, awhile, and, thought, whiffling, burbled, beamish, callooh, callay, he, chortled, joy, hast, thou, slain, come, arms, O, day. Many canonical common words. However, unique \"content\" canonical words relevant: beware, frumious, whiffling, burbled, beamish, callooh, callay. Around 7 distinct canonical tokens - yes</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines ≈8-9 syllables, shorter lines ≈5-7. Check sample stanza:\n\nStanza 1:\nBeware the Keyblink, my son! (6 syll) - short line maybe\nThe twists it makes, the locks undone! (8 syll) - longer\nBeware the Jangle-jing, and shun (7 syll) - shorter\nThe frumious Keyblink! (6 syll) - shorter\n\nPattern approximates, but not strict alternation longer/shorter? Possibly borderline, but does not clearly fail. Other stanzas similar.\n\nOverall syllable tightness mostly acceptable - yes</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhymes on (2,4) lines vary: undone/shun, brood/slink (slant), spent/wink, boy/joy repeated, and final stanza repeated. No rhyme ending reused >2 times except ring echo repeated final stanza rhymes. Variety proper - yes</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word appears very frequently. \"Keyblink\" repeated 5 times but likely <8% total content words. No obvious overuse - yes</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages roots are Keyblink, Jangle-jing, clink-clank, clatter-wood, plinkish, slink, twinkly wink. Distinct roots at least 6, no single suffix dominates >50% - yes</C22_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>", "judge_error": "worker_error: process_row() takes from 7 to 8 positional arguments but 9 were given"}

No slaying or conquering, only interaction and wistfulness.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return / celebration: No triumphant return or celebration; instead ending is wistful and homesick. So no.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: Counting invented or unusual words excluding canonical set: frilgig, twirl, snurk, gloam, crumply, gorse-tops, thistles (standard), hiraeth Wock (coinage), mizzle-muff, whimperwail, snarfled, soodled, burbled (canonical), gribble, wiffled, gloaming (standard but archaic), mem’ry-fleck.

Mostly yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creature/entity central to action, not canonical/Jabberwock: The \"Hiraeth Wock\" is the adversary and central, also \"Mizzle-Muff\" and \"Whimperwail\" mentioned but not directly confronted; main focus is on the Hiraeth Wock as adversary/character. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: At least two bursts like canonical style (\"snicker-snack\", \"burbled\") needed. Here \"burbled\" is canonical, but \"snurk\", \"soodled\", \"wiffled\", \"gribble\" seem more like coinages but uncertain as onomatopoeic bursts. Not clearly onomatopoeic bursts (exclamations or noises) but more invented verbs/nouns. No clear bursting exclamations like \"Pop!\", \"Hiss!\". So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Examining stanzas for repeated consonants: stanza 1 (\"frilgig,\" \"slithy,\" \"mists,\" \"twirl,\" \"snurk\"), stanza 2 (“Beware the Hiraeth Wock” uses W sound, “Whimperwail that sings”), stanza 7 (\"wiffled through the gloaming’s grasp\"). At least 2 stanzas show clear within-line alliteration/consonance beyond incidental. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning present (stanza 2), preparation is weak or emotional (stanza 3), encounter clearly next (stanza 4), no decisive action (missing slaying), no celebration/return (last stanza wistful ending). Sequence mostly in canonical order, except decisive action and return are missing. Arc incomplete. Since rules require canonical order fully, no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines from canonical poem found. Different wording and structure entirely.

Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines ~8-9 syllables, shorter lines ~5-7 syllables. Sampling stanza 1: line 1 = ’Twas frilgig when the slithy mists (8 syll), line 2 = Did twirl and snurk in gloam (6 syll), line 3 = And all the crumply gorse-tops tossed (8-9 syll), line 4 = Like thistles far from home (6 syll). Pattern holds in most stanzas. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The poem uses rhyme sparingly and somewhat variably. Rhymes (2,4) lines vary (son/shun, wide/inside), some stanzas no rhyme. No repeated end words are reused more than twice. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No single content word excessively repeated; \"still\" appears thrice but common and under thresholds; no content word >5 or >8%. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages clearly show a variety of roots: frilgig, snurk, crumply, miraeth, mizzle-muff, whimperwail, snarfled, soodled, gribble, wiffled, mem’ry-fleck, etc. At least 4 distinct roots represented.

Avoid the eigengap’s sharp bite, And shun the Fiedler’s light!” which functions as a caution.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation is present: stanza 3 describes the protagonist taking \"his graph in hand\", considering nearest neighbors, standing in thought to partition — clear preparation/resolution before encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation represented in stanza 4: “The Snark with eigenvalues fraught, Whirled through the sparse and dense array, And labeled far away!” The meeting of protagonist and adversary is alluded through Snark labeling the data.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: no explicit depiction of a “slaying” or destructive act, but stanza 5 questions “And hast thou found the clusters bright?” implying resolution by spectral clustering success rather than physical battle. The “chortled soft in joy profound” implies success achieved decisively. Since no physical or violent act, the “decisive act” is more conceptual but does resolve central tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration is present in stanza 6, with “Oh, come to me, my eigenlight!” and “He chortled soft in joy profound—The spectral groups were found!” Jubilation after resolution is clearly depicted.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Distinct invented coinages: fractal, modes, k-means, manifold, PCA, Laplacian, eigengap, Fiedler, linkage, eigenvalues, sparse, dense, labeled, eigenlight — many are technical jargon rather than purely invented nonsense words, but these are not canonical Carroll coinages. Counting clearly novel or at least distinct coinages: fractal (known English), modes (English plural), k-means (technical term), manifold, PCA, laplacian, eigengap, Fiedler, linkage, eigenvalues, sparse, dense (English adjectives), chortled, gyre, gimble (canonical), snark (referencing Snark, which is Lewis Carroll but not Jabberwock). Probably 8+ technical/coinage terms not canonical. The poem mixes technical jargon and partial coinages. Accepting 8 distinct “invented or technical” coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Every stanza contains at least one technical or invented term: fractal (1), modes (1), k-means (2), manifold (1), PCA (1), Laplacian (1), eigengap (1), Fiedler (1), linkage (1), eigenvalues (1), sparse (1), dense (1), eigenlight (1).

More mild and incidental.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: fits canonical arc: warning (stanza 2) → preparation (3) → encounter (4) → decisive action (5) → return/celebration (6) in order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No exact line matches from canonical Jabberwocky poem; all lines rewritten.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used: slithy, gyre, gimble appear once in first stanza; “snicker-snack” etc. not used. Canonical tokens ≤8 as only 3 appear. So canonical lexicon usage is low.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts: lines often not close to typical Jabberwocky ~8-9 syllables for longer and 5-7 for shorter lines. For example stanza 1 lines lengths: \nLine1: “‘Twas fractal, and the slithy nodes” (7 syllables approx.)\nLine2: “Did gyre and gimble in the modes;” (7 syllables)\nPattern not alternating clearly longer/shorter lines; meter is looser than canonical pattern. So syllable tightness criterion not met.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme pairs vary across stanzas, endings like modes, spun, bite/light, plight/sought, sought/away, bright/profound etc. No exact repetition of (2,4) rhyme word >2 times excluding ring echo. Rhyme variety is acceptable.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: repeated words like “the” common, no single content word overused disproportionately.
