No clear repeated content words or refrain linking start and end is present.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition: Present in the first stanza—\"Beware the Blothering Sand, my son! The grains that slip...\" This matches the prototype warning style.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: No explicit preparation or armament by protagonist appears before confrontation—no tool or resolve described, no waiting. The poem focuses on warnings and descriptions without a narrative hero action.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: No explicit meeting or confrontation with the adversary; the poem is focused on warning and description of the sand and related entities but no direct encounter.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: No decisive action or resolution of central tension; no hero action or ending with resolution is indicated.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return or celebration: No return or jubilant acknowledgement found in poem; tone is more cautionary/descriptive than celebratory.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Coinages include \"Blothering,\" \"Snicklebreeze,\" \"wibbling,\" \"Fritterfluff,\" \"zizzy,\" \"twiddle-woze,\" \"flurried fluffs,\" \"tumbly,\" and \"glim\" (gleam is standard); counting eight or more distinct coined words (counting “twiddle-woze” also as coinage). Meets threshold.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza contains at least one coinage: stanza 1 (Blothering, Snicklebreeze, wibbling, Whirl), stanza 2 (tumbly, flurried, fluffs), stanza 3 (Fritterfluff, zizzy, twiddle-woze), stanza 4 (glim possibly coined, slip-slide possibly coined). Meets the criterion.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: Named non-canonical creatures/entities include \"Snicklebreeze,\" \"wibbling Whirl,\" \"Fritterfluff,\" which act as adversaries or hazards. They are central to the poem’s warnings and imagery. Therefore, criterion met.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: There are no clear onomatopoeic bursts like “snicker-snack” or “pop,” no abrupt sound-imitative expressions, just descriptive words. Does not meet this criterion.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Strong alliteration/consonance in multiple stanzas, e.g., “flurried fluffs,” “tumbly spite,” “sand still slips,” “slip-slide, wispy, breezy theme,” “twiddle-woze.” At least two stanzas show clear sound patterning beyond incidental repeats.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Tone alignment: Tone is whimsical and somewhat playful but also cautionary; mythic in style with invented terms, fitting Jabberwocky’s tone closely.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim lines: No lines exactly match canonical poem; language is original although in Carroll’s style.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Uses no canonical Jabberwocky token words observed (no “brillig,” “slithy,” “toves,” etc.). Canonical tokens ≤8 (in fact, zero). Meets criterion.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines mostly range about 8-9 syllables (e.g., first stanza line 2: \"The grains that slip, the trails that run!\" - 8 syllables). Shorter lines vary around 5-7 syllables. Pattern not perfectly consistent but approximate to Jabberwocky’s ~8/6 pattern in most stanzas. Criterion mostly met.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: End rhymes on lines 2 and 4 vary stanza-to-stanza: run/shun, flight/delight, doze/woze, theme/scheme—all unique pairs, no overuse. Rhyme variety sufficient.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word appears overused; words like “sand,” “blothering,” “beware” appear multiple times but below threshold for overuse considering total word count.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages show multiple distinct roots: Blothering, Snicklebreeze, wibbling, Whirl, Fritterfluff, zizzy, twiddle-woze, flurried fluffs, tumbly. No single suffix accounts for >50%.

No clear refrain or strong repetition of content words with opening stanza. So minimal ring echo, more a closing admonition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present: first stanza warns \"Beware the Awlful, my son!\" matching early caution.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before encounter: second stanza shows the protagonist taking the \"thrunk\", seeking the beast, resting and pondering — prep and resolution evident.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter/confrontation: stanza 3 describes the Awlful coming with \"splintered wood\", describing its threatening features and attack.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive slaying/action: stanza 4 shows protagonist attacking with the thrunk (\"One-two!\"), drilling holes, leaving Awlful \"drilled\", suggesting resolution of central tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>No explicit return homecoming or celebration lines; stanza 5 is a warning again, no joyful recognition or \"O frabjous day\" style. So no clear return/celebration.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct coinages invented:  \nWords like \"Awlful\" (though derivative of 'awl'), \"borp-tipped\", \"spikulous\", \"thrunk\", \"toolshed scheme\" (some standard), \"slippered thought\", \"pierceful\", \"wimbly\" seem invented or modified.  \nIdentified coinages: Awlful, borp-tipped, spikulous, thrunk, slippered, pierceful, wimbly, jabber (used as adjective), possibly \"scheme\" and \"scampered\" are standard.  \nAt least 7 coinages—\"borp-tipped\", \"spikulous\", \"thrunk\", \"slippered\", \"pierceful\", \"wimbly\", \"awlful\" (inventive), \"jabber\" (partial). Not canonical or standard words.  \nSo about 7-8, roughly meeting threshold.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Every stanza appears to have at least one coinage: stanza 1 (Awlful, borp-tipped, spikulous), stanza 2 (thrunk), stanza 3 (slippered, pierceful), stanza 4 (wimbly), stanza 5 (jabber as adjective). Yes, coinages in each stanza.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>The named creature is “Awlful,” which is non-canonical and central to action.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeic bursts: stanza 4 has \"One-two! One-two!\" which is onomatopoeia of a rhythmic sound. No other strong onomatopoeia like \"snicker-snack\" or \"burbled\". Only one distinct onomatopoeic burst, so less than 2.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Clear alliteration/consonance:  \nExamples include \"pricks that poke, the stabs that stun\" (s and p sounds), \"pierceful snout\", \"twisty gleam\". Present in multiple stanzas (at least 2). Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Tone is mythic and whimsical with playful invented words and fantastical framing; not flat prose or promotional copy.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines from canonical poem are reused; all lines rewritten and original.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used very minimally; no direct canonical coinages named from original Jabberwock; thus canonical token count is ≤8.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts (approximate) in longer/shorter lines:  \nStanza 1 lines: \"Beware the Awlful, my son!\" (6 syll) / \"The pricks that poke, the stabs that stun!\" (8 syll) / \"Beware the pointy borp-tipped nail,\" (8 syll) / \"And shun the spikulous flail!\" (6 syll)  \nLine length pattern alternation is inconsistent and sometimes reversed from Jabberwocky pattern (typically longer first, then shorter). Pattern is irregular, so syllable tightness is imperfect.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety (2,4) across stanzas is low: only ~2 stanzas rhyme 2nd and 4th lines; also reuse of \"Beware\" in 1st and 5th stanza. No repeated end word >2 times excluding ring echo. Varied but insufficient rhyme pattern.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No overuse of single content words beyond threshold; no word appears >5 times or >8% of tokens outside allowed phrases.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show multiple roots (\"borp\", \"spik-\", \"thrunk\", \"wimbly\", \"awlful\", \"pierce-\"); no single suffix dominates >50%.>4 distinct roots evident.</C22_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>"}
