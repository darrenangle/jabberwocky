Stanza count 6 is within 5–8 inclusive. Meets quatrain and stanza count criteria.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>4 lines per stanza; checking syllable/content word length alternation in at least 60% stanzas:  \n- Stanza 1 line lengths vary somewhat, with longer then shorter pattern plausible but content words difference uncertain.  \n- Stanza 2 similar, some variation but no strong clear alternating long/short lines with ≥2 content words difference reliably in majority of stanzas.  \nOverall, less than 60% stanzas clearly alternate longer/shorter lines by ≥2 content words.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme pattern (lines 2 and 4) rhymes or slant rhymes in most stanzas:  \n- Stanza 1: gleam / space (imperfect rhyme), no clear rhyme at 2-4 lines.  \n- Stanza 2: wing / reel (slant rhyme?), acceptable.  \n- Stanza 3: boughs / thought (no rhyme).  \n- Stanza 4: made / displayed (perfect rhyme).  \n- Stanza 5: fleet / misbeat (rhyme).  \n- Stanza 6: boy / joy (rhyme).  \nAt least 4 of 6 stanzas have 2-4 rhyme or close; no over-reliance on AABB pattern overall.  \nSo over 60% stanzas (4/6 = 66%) meet rhyme pattern with (2,4) rhyme.  \nAvoids AABB dominance as other rhyme positions vary.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza repeats opening phrase motifs: \"’Twas gloaming in the stubble-field, and shifting shapes did gleam / And sussurate with whiffle-wings—a living, breathing stream.\" This echoes the first stanza with at least 2 repeated content words/phrases (“gloaming,” “stubble-field,” “sussurate,” “whiffle-wings,” “living, breathing stream”). Clear ring composition present.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>There is an explicit warning/admonition in stanza 2: “Beware the Murmuration, child! The swirl of beak and wing!” etc. This is equivalent to 'Beware...' and admonishes the protagonist early.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>The protagonist prepares: stanza 3 says “He gripped his snick-snack cap, and stood his watch beneath the boughs,” and “So rested he ... and stood awhile in thought”—planning/waiting/preparation clearly present before encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>There is a clear encounter/confrontation in stanza 4 with the swirling flock described (“When sudden, with a whoosh-balm breeze, the swirling storm was caught!” and active verbs). The protagonist witnesses the phenomenon, implied meeting with the adversary/obstacle-like entity (the flock).</C8_think>\n<C9_think>No clear decisive slaying or defeat action is evident. The poem describes watching, witnessing, admiring the murmuration, but no decisive act resolving tension like slaying or killing occurs.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>No clear return or homecoming described. Final stanza is a return to beginning scene with celebration (\"O splendid sight! What swirl-delight! You've witnessed flutter-joy!\"), possibly a celebration, but no return journey or triumphant homecoming per se. The protagonist seems still at the scene. This might be borderline but not definitive return/celebration.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Distinct invented coinages: “gloaming” (existing English), “sussurate,” “whiffle-wings,” “frillig,” “murmuration,” “twizzle-twists,” “whoosh-balm,” “snick-snack” (variant), “flock-flash,” “snicker-sweet,” “flutter-joy,” “sync-swarm,” “flitter-flutter,” “shadow-shiver,” “sky-dance,” “ploughturn” (compound), “beamish” (canonical).  \nCounting only clearly invented non-standard words: sussurate, whiffle-wings, frillig, murmur-..., twizzle-twists, whoosh-balm, snick-snack (variant), flock-flash, snicker-sweet, flutter-joy, sync-swarm, flitter-flutter, shadow-shiver, sky-dance, ploughturn—about 12+ non-canonical coinages.  \nYes, ≥8 distinct coinages present.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage, for example:  \n- Stanza 1: “gloaming”, “sussurate”, “whiffle-wings”, “frillig”, “murmuration”, “burbled”  \n- Stanza 2: “sync-swarm”, “flitter-flutter”, “shadow-shiver”  \n- Stanza 3: “snick-snack”, “ploughturn”  \n- Stanza 4: “whoosh-balm”  \n- Stanza 5: “twizzle-twists”, “flock-flash”, “snicker-sweet”  \n- Stanza 6: “beamish”, “flutter-joy”, “whiffle-wings” repeated  \nTherefore all 6 stanzas have ≥1 coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: “Murmuration” is treated as a named adversarial entity (referred to as “the Murmuration”). Not canonical like Jabberwock but used as central foe/object in the narrative. No other creature name mentioned; Murmuration is the central entity.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeic bursts present: “snick-snack” and “snicker-sweet” appear in stanza 3 and 5, and “whoosh-balm” in stanza 4 has a mild sound-echo effect. Two strong onomatopoeic bursts: “snick-snack” and “snicker-sweet.”  \nYes, ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance beyond incidental:  \n- Stanza 1: “shifting shapes,” “sussurate with whiffle-wings,” “living, breathing stream” show clear internal alliteration.  \n- Stanza 2: “flash-flock flux,” “feather-knot,” “sync-swarm”—strong consonance/alliteration.  \nThus ≥2 stanzas show clear alliteration/consonance well above incidental repetition.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>The arc beats appear roughly in canonical order:  \n1. Warning/admonition (stanza 2),  \n2. Preparation (stanza 3),  \n3. Encounter (stanza 4),  \n4. Decisive act (absent),  \n5. Return/celebration (stanza 6).  \nBecause decisive act absent, arc is broken. Without the decisive act (slaying), arc is incomplete and out of canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line is an exact match to a canonical line from 'Jabberwocky'. The poem uses new wording and paraphrasing, no verbatim copying except canonical words embedded as coinages but no full line verbatim.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used: “snick-snack” (variant), “beamish,” “burbled,” “murmuration” (not canonical), “whiffle” (coinage but close), “snicker” partial (part of snicker-sweet coinage), none other canonical words repeated. Very few canonical lexicon tokens ≤8, probably 4 or fewer distinct canonical recognized words. So canonical budget ≤8.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness pattern (~8-9 syllables longer lines; ~5-7 syllables shorter lines alternating) checked in >5 stanzas:  \n- Lines tend to be longer, often 9-11 syllables; many shorter lines have 7-9 syllables, sometimes bordering on too long shorter lines. Alternation pattern less clear.  \n- Lines 2 and 4 do rhyme but syllable count is often on the longer side, not rigidly 5–7 shorter lines.  \nNot tightly controlled as Jabberwocky’s ~8/6 pattern; borderline but leans towards no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety of (2,4) end rhymes checked across all 6 stanzas: “gleam/space” (imperfect), “wing/reel,” “boughs/thought,” “made/displayed,” “fleet/misbeat,” “boy/joy.”  \nRhyme endings overall different, no exact end word reused >2 times. No over-repetition of rhyme words besides ring echo. Rhyme variety is good.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word is overused:  \n“the” and “and” are articles/conjunctions, content words spread out, coinages varied, no clear >5 or >8% content word repetition of any one word besides ring echo repeats at start/end stanza. So lexical repetition guarded.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety includes multiple distinct roots: “sussurate,” “whiffle,” “frillig,” “murmuration,” “twizzle,” “whoosh,” “snick,” “flock,” “snicker,” “flutter,” “sync,” “flitter,” “shadow,” “sky,” “plough.” These form well over four distinct roots, with no over-dominance of a single suffix or root.

The poem matches the style and narrative format of Jabberwocky without deviating to an unrelated subject.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem implies themes of mystery, hidden knowledge, and the power of reading or unlocking secrets (e.g., the letter keeps whispering, crinkling, with a ‘secret thing’).

This constitutes a ring composition with more than 2 repeated content words/phrases.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present: stanza 2 contains “Beware the Tonebar, my son!”, an explicit warning to the protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation present: stanza 3 describes the protagonist taking “his pick of polished shim,” resting by the Twangle-tree, and standing in thought, indicating planning and armament before the encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation present: stanza 4 depicts the Tonebar approaching “with its tremble-brood,” “came twang-a-thrumming through the wood,” and “buzzled as it sought,” showing a clear meeting between protagonist and adversary.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action is present: stanza 5, “One, two! One, two! And through and through / The vibrant pick went snicker-snap! / He left it dead, and with its head / He went galumphing back,” shows a decisive act resolving the tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration present: stanza 6 shows jubilant acknowledgement—“Come to my arms, my beamish son! / O frabjous day! Calloo! Callay! / He chortled in his joy.” The mood mirrors the original’s return and celebration.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: at least 8 distinct novel coined words beyond canonical words appear, e.g. strumulous, spandilous, plink, plonk, fipples, twang-a-thrumming, buzzled, Twangle-tree, shim, mandoverse, tremble-brood, snicker-snap (variant), snicker-snap is close to canonical 'snicker-snack' but altered. Counting variants as distinct coinages cautiously, at least 8 distinct coined forms are present.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least 1 coinage: e.g. “strumulous,” “spandilous,” “fipples,” “Tonebar,” “mandoverse,” “Twangle-tree,” “twang-a-thrumming,” “buzzled,” “shim,” etc., present and spread across stanzas.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named: The Tonebar is clearly the central named entity, distinct from canonical Jabberwock or canonical creatures, and central to the action.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeic bursts: “snicker-snap” (variant of “snicker-snack”) in stanza 5; “plink and plonk” in stanza 1; “twang-a-thrumming” in stanza 4; “buzzled” (possibly onomatopoeic). At least two clear onomatopoeic bursts are present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in at least 2 stanzas: e.g. stanza 1: “strumulous” and “spandilous strings,” “plink and plonk”; stanza 4: “twang-a-thrumming through the wood,” “buzzled as it sought”; these are clear within-line phonetic devices beyond incidental repeats.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order canonical: warning (stanza 2) → preparation (stanza 3) → encounter (stanza 4) → decisive action (stanza 5) → return/celebration (stanza 6); sequence is canonical and in order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: no lines exactly match the original poem’s lines; some echoes exist, but none exact.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens ≤8: This poem uses “beamish,” “snicker-snap” (variant of snicker-snack), “galumphing,” “frabjous,” “calloo callay,” “beware,” “my son,” “dead,” “head” and “wood,” mostly different or paraphrased; judging total direct canonical named tokens about 7 or fewer; some canonical words modified or paraphrased, so canonical budget is maintained within 8.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines ≈8–9 syllables, shorter lines ≈5–7. Inspection: stanza 1 line 1 “’Twas strumulous, and the spandilous strings” (9 syllables), line 2 “Did plink and plonk on the soundboard’s flings;” (9 syll), line 3 “All filigreed were the fipples and frills,” (9 syll), line 4 “And the tonebar whiffled the musical thrills.” (9 syll). This stanza has less syllable differentiation (longer-shorter) but other stanzas show better alternation. Although a bit tighter in length than original alternating ~8/6, the consistent syllable count is close but lines do not alternate clearly between long/short with ~2 syllable difference consistently. Also content word alternation supports rhythm. Marginal but stanzas mostly meet the pattern; however slightly less strict than original. Since strictness requires both syllable count and alternating lines, and this poem is more uniform in syllable count, safer to say no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) line rhymes are varied across stanzas with endwords differing. No end word repeated more than twice besides ring echo; variety is good.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No content word appears excessively. Beamish appears twice, son appears a few times as in original usage but not exceeding the threshold. No single content word seems overused.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: There are distinct roots: strumulous, spandilous, plink/plonk, fipples, shim, mandoverse, twang, buzzled, twangle, etc. No single coined suffix accounts for over 50%. Coinage variety meets requirement.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem addresses a “Tonebar” instead of the “Jabberwock,” but clearly follows the same concept and topic: a fantastical named adversary threatening the protagonist, a sword-like object replaced by a “pick,” and same narrative arc. The substitution is thematic but on-topic; considered adherence.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is a coherent implied layer — struggle against a musical adversary, themes of battle, caution, and triumph present; tonal echoes of coming-of-age or challenge metaphors are detectable. The subtext is coherent and sustained.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Coinages at least \"fribble,\" \"Fid,\" \"Four-Strand,\" \"whippy,\" \"plashy,\" \"gribble\" — six distinct coinages are clear. \"Four-Strand\" might be a compound, less coinage-like as invented, but treating \"Fid\" and \"fribble\" and \"plashy,\" \"gribble,\" \"whippy\" as coinages. Only about 5-6 distinct coinages; fewer than 8 required. So no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Does each stanza contain ≥1 coinage? Mostly \"fribble\" appears in opening and closing stanzas, \"Fid\" in others, \"plashy\" in the 4th stanza, \"whippy\" in third and fifth stanza, \"gribble\" in fifth. But not every stanza has a clear coinage. For example, stanza 2 (\"rope's design!\") uses common English words. Stanza 6 reuses canonical words \"snicker-snack,\" \"galumphing,\" and \"beamish.\" So some stanzas lack coinages. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Is a non-canonical creature/entity named and central to action (not “Jabberwock”)? Yes, the \"Fid\" is clearly named and is central to the action.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Are ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts present? The poem uses \"snicker-snack!\" which is canonical and onomatopoeic, but no other explicit onomatopoeic bursts (\"Pop!\", \"Hiss!\", etc.) are present. Only one clear onomatopoeia: \"snicker-snack!\" So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Are ≥2 stanzas with strong alliteration/consonance? Some alliteration present: \"fribble\" and \"four-strand,\" \"snip,\" \"coils that bind,\" \"plashy thought,\" but mostly mild. No distinct, strong alliteration stands out clearly in ≥2 stanzas beyond incidental. Probably no.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning appears first (stanza 2), then preparation (stanza 3), encounter (stanza 4), decisive act (stanza 5), return/celebration (stanza 6). Correct canonical arc order is maintained.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: Some lines identical to canonical poem: \"’Twas ..., and the slithy toves / Did gyre and gimble in the wabe\", \"All mimsy were the borogoves / And the mome raths outgrabe\", \"And stood awhile in thought\", \"And burbled as it came\", \"One, two! One, two!

Exact matches present, so no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget (distinct canonical tokens ≤8) is met — plenty of new invented words reduce canonical tokens usage.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: lines 1 and 3 in stanzas hover around 8–9 syllables, lines 2 and 4 around 6–7 syllables following Jabberwocky pattern consistently. Close match.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety in (2,4): rhymes wabe/outgrabe, bind/design, sought/thought, flame/came, snicker-snack/back, joy/joy, outgrabe/outgrabe. Some repetition but generally varied. No exact end word reused >2 times ignoring ring echo. Mostly okay.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: \"Fid\" appears repeatedly but acceptable since it is the main creature; other words like \"thought,\" \"the,\" \"and\" are function words. No content word (>5 times or >8%) overused beyond reason. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: 5-6 coinages identified based on varied roots (\"fribble,\" \"Fid,\" \"plashy,\" \"whippy,\" \"gribble\") so coinages from multiple roots and no dominant suffix. Just reaches variety but coinage count low. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly covers the topic of a \"Fid\" as a foe, a battle poem in the style of Jabberwocky, adhering to subject.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem is a close pastiche with minor new details, no strong new motif or undertone beyond surface action of battle and caution, so subtext presence is weak or minimal.

So rhyme variety is good.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Content word repetition: no single content word is overused excessively; “the” and short function words expected; most repeated content words are entities like “Blued Screw” but that counts as a named creature.
