Murmuration is not a creature but a collective noun for starlings; \"Murmuration\" is the adversary or thing warned about, but it is natural and non-coinage. Not a fantastical creature like Jubjub or Bandersnatch, but since \"Murmuration\" is the focus of the poem and named as the object of caution and awe, the criterion may be marginal.

Coinages are varied, with multiple distinct roots (\"slivy,\" \"glork,\" \"whirly,\" \"twisty,\" \"flippy,\" \"gyre-gleam,\" \"whiffle,\" \"flimsy,\" etc.) no single suffix dominates over 50% -> yes</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly addresses the murmuration as the subject, a natural phenomenon, not substituting a different topic. The theme is about starlings’ murmuration, not Jabberwocky creatures but parallels the poem’s style and motif; poem matches the poem style topic loosely - as a Carrollian poem style, yes -> yes</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond surface action, is there a coherent implied layer (motif/undertone)? The poem hints at enigmatic beauty, transience, mystery of nature's dance with a respectful caution (beware), undertone of awe and twilight’s fleeting nature, a motif of delicate wonder -> yes</C24_think>\n</think>\n\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Rough count shows ≥60% stanzas have ballad meter alternation.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (2,4) rhyme occurs in most stanzas; near rhymes/slant rhymes present (\"bright\"/\"light\", \"slide\"/\"tide\", etc.), with AABB avoided (mainly ABAB or ABCB). Meets criterion.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza (7th) does not echo the first stanza with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases or refrain. It is different in meaning and content. Ring composition fails.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present: the 2nd stanza contains a clear 'Beware the Glazen Step, my lad!' warning.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Protagonist's preparation before encounter: took axe in hand, sought foe, rested by Overspill, stood awhile in thought. Preparation is present.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter: \"And, as in clinkflashed thought he stood, The Glazen Step... Came slicken-slinking...\" signals direct meeting.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive act: \"Skritch-skretch! ... The sharp axe hewn and cleft! He left its sheen on glossy rocks.\" Decisive slaying action present.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration in stanza 6: \"And hast thou slicked the Glazen Step? ... He cheered...\" suggests jubilant acknowledgement after return.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: 'slickemorn', 'frimstones', 'puckergrips', 'blinkmoon', 'Wheeker-beaked', 'frubious', 'Overspill', 'clinkflashed', 'slicken-slinking', 'wimy-wispish', 'Skritch-skretch', 'old-stride', 'gladenous', 'gladens' (from \"gladenous\"). Total >8 distinct invented words.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Most stanzas contain ≥1 coinage: first stanza multiple coinages, second also, including final quatrain. All except maybe the very last extra stanza contain coinage. Thus likely yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>A named creature/entity central to action other than canonical words: \"Glazen Step\" (creature/obstacle named), also \"Wheeker-beaked\" possibly an entity. \"Glazen Step\" is the adversary here, not canonical. Criterion met.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts: \"Skritch-skretch! Skritch-skretch!\" clear onomatopoeic sounds repeated twice or more. Also \"One wimy-wispish bloom!\" is more descriptive than onomatopoeic. Only one clear onomatopoeia burst stanza identified, need ≥2 stanzas with such bursts. Presence is borderline but only one clear stanza with onomatopoeia. No second clear onomatopoeia stanza. Criterion fails.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance explicitly present in at least 2 stanzas beyond incidental: Examples are \"slickemorn... frimstones\", \"skritch-skretch... sharp axe\", \"clinkflashed thought\", \"slicken-slinking\", \"frumple paths\". At least two clear stanzas have strong alliteration/consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning, preparation, encounter, decisive action, return/celebration appear in canonical order: 2nd stanza warning, 3rd preparation, 4th encounter, 5th slaying, 6th return/celebration. Last stanza is extra advisory outside main action. Meets criterion.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines from canonical poem; all distinct text and wording.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used: none of the canonical lexicon appears (brillig, slithy, toves, gimble, gyre, mimsy, borogoves, mome, raths, outgrabe, Jubjub, Bandersnatch, vorpal, manxome, Tumtum, uffish, whiffling, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish). Thus <=8 canonical tokens (actually zero). Criterion met.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Every quatrain approximately matches syllable pattern of Jabberwocky with long lines ~8-9 syllables and short lines ~5-7 syllables. Most stanzas keep this pattern well.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes are slant but varied and well spread, no word reused more than twice at end rhyme (excluding ring echo, which is absent). Criterion met.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word appears excessively. “Glazen” repeats but well below threshold. No overused content word detected.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages seem to come from multiple distinct roots (slickemorn, frimstones, puckergrips, blinkmoon, Wheeker, frubious, Overspill, clinkflashed, slicken, wimy, Skritch, old-stride, gladenous) more than 4. No single suffix dominates >50% of coinages. Criterion met.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>The poem addresses the same topic as Jabberwocky-style poem: a mysterious creature/adversary (\"Glazen Step\") is warned against, hunted, slain, and celebrated. Topic adhered; no substitution with unrelated subject.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>The poem has implied layers: frost, ice, wintery danger motif underscored by words like \"slickemorn\", \"glaze\", \"blinkmoon\", \"gleam\", \"frostglebs\". The motif of treacherous icy terrain and hazardous journey suggests coherent undertones analogous to original’s lurking danger.

The requirement is all stanzas have 4 lines. Since stanzas vary in length (some are 6 or more lines), this fails the criterion.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>The ballad meter check requires ≥60% of stanzas to alternate longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content words difference. Line lengths vary irregularly; many stanzas have lines closer in length, and no clear consistent strict alternation seen. Less than 60% of stanzas meet this stricter alternate long/short line pattern.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>The rhyme scheme in ≥60% of stanzas should have (2,4) rhyme or slant rhyme; the poem shows some rhymes but lines 2 and 4 do not consistently rhyme in most stanzas, and no obvious AABB pattern dominance is evident. Fewer than 60% stanzas meet this vowel end rhyme pattern.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza echoes the first with several repeated content words and a clear refrain-like repetition of \"’Twas you\" and \"whopply,\" plus the opening phrase ‘’Twas flurdling’ in the first stanza is repeated at the start of the last stanza, fulfilling ring composition criterion.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>There is an admonition early on: “Beware the flirkering Scrawk,” a direct warning to the protagonist, so the admonition is present.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>The poem shows the protagonist “Then slowed his frame, stretched eyes more wide,” a moment of pause/preparation and heightened awareness before the encounter, which can count as preparation or resolve before confrontation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>There is an encounter implied with the 'flirkering Scrawk' and whiffling shapes/presence to be seized or confronted. However, the confrontation is somewhat nebulous but clear enough that a meeting/encounter takes place.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>The decisive action is uncertain or weak; the closest is “One, two! One, two! Through furrowed deep, The starfling skeins their secrets keep!” which echoes the original Jabberwocky \"One, two! One, two!\" but no clear killing or slaying or resolution is explicitly described.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return or a celebratory homecoming moment is implied in the last stanza with Plunkelpike waving and naming “O Jubjub Flirke, 'twas you! 'Twas you— That whopply, flaffling crew!” but no clear jubilant acknowledgement or homecoming celebration like original poem. More of a resigned or melancholic recognition.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages include flurdling, stubble-strew, frowsily, blaffled, gloff, diffed, Plunkelpike, flirkering, Scrawk, burbly, whopply, glopping, flock-nimbs, plaffing, trazzled, spiffed, whiffled, pluff-skimm'd, flaffly, flimesome, snickerdrift, flaffling—easily over 8 distinct invented coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Most stanzas contain at least one coined word or neologism. The first stanza has many; others continue with coined terms in almost every stanza, so each stanza has ≥1 coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>A non-canonical creature named is “flirkering Scrawk,” a central adversary to the protagonist (Plunkelpike). Not Jabberwock or canonical creature, so this criterion is met.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>The poem contains onomatopoeia-like bursts such as “snickerdrift” (somewhat onomatopoeic) and “burbly croak,” and “pluff-skimm’d calls,” but onomatopoeic bursts like “snicker-snack” or clear sound effects are limited. The only clear onomatopoeic burst is \"snickerdrift\" near the end; “burbly” is more adjective. The count of at least 2 clear onomatopoeic bursts is doubtful.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>There is clear alliteration and consonance beyond incidental in stanzas 1 (“stubble-strew,” “crops all blaffled,” “whiffling shapes”), and others such as “flirkering Scrawk,” “burbly croak,” “whopply, glopping tide!” and “pluff-skimm’d calls.” At least two stanzas show strong alliteration/consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>The arc order of canonical Jabberwocky is warning, preparation, encounter, decisive act, return/celebration. This poem follows warning, preparation, encounter but decisive act is weak/missing, and return is subdued. Arc order is roughly canonical but the decisive action is unclear and return is not jubilant, so partially but not crisply canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines exactly verbatim from canonical Jabberwocky. Words like \"One, two! One, two!\" appear but without direct line reuse; the poem is original in phrasing.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used include “whiffling” (once), “Jubjub” (last stanza), “snickerdrift” (made-up, not canonical), and some possible canonical roots like “burbly” echoes “burbled” but is varied; overall distinct canonical words under 8, so budget is preserved.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count per line is irregular and often longer or shorter than Jabberwocky's ~8/6 pattern; longer lines vary from 8 to 10+ syllables, and shorter lines vary widely; thus syllable tightness is not consistently met in every stanza.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety check: the poem reuses similar sounding or exact end rhymes like “side/tide,” “slide/tide,” “wide/tide” multiple times; some repeated rhyme words exceed limit of 2 times (like “tide” and “you”). So rhyme variety is poor.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No overuse of single content word outside ring echo detected; repeated words like “tide” appear in rhymes but not as overused content words >5 times or >8% total content words. Lexical repetition is guarded.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages have diverse roots: flur-, stub-, frow-, bla-, gloff, diff-, Plunkelpike, flirk-, Scrawk, burb-, whopp-, glopp-, flock-, plaff-, spiff-, whiff-, pluff-, flaff-, flim-, snickerd-. No single suffix or root dominates >50% of coinages, so variety is decent.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>The poem clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-style subject of a strange creature (\"flirkering Scrawk\"), a protagonist’s watch in wilderness, and encounter with a flock, maintaining thematic adherence to the original poem’s style and implied topic of a mythic quest or strange adversary.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>The poem conveys a subtle subtext of elusive pursuit and melancholy watching (Plunkelpike unable to reap crops, watching a swirling haze), possibly about futility or loss, supporting a coherent implied motif beyond surface action.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

At least 10+ unique coinages not canonical; count ≥8 definitely met. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage: (e.g., stanza 1: flimsy, sliver-swines, snicker-snack (canonical), squonky, slurpadelves, slurry.

Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: snicker-snack appears (canonical), also “snickersnash” (coinage clearly onomatopoeic), “crunkled” suggests onomatopoeia. At least 2 onomatopoeic bursts present. Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: stanza 1 has “sliver-swines”/“snicker-snack”/“slurpadelves”/“slithy,” strong s-consonance; stanza 3 uses “brakkish blade,” “manxomely whirred and spun,” “honing-clangs had,” stanza 5 “snickersnash sang blade on bone,” stanza 7 repeats s-alliteration.

Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: rhyme pairs 2,4 vary stanza by stanza (spree/slurry, quick/stick, spun/run, cry/sky, bone/back, cried/clap, spree/slurry repeated); end words repeated only twice for ring echo allowed. No rhyme word greatly overused. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: content words generally varied; no single content word appears >5 times or >8% frequency outside of ring echo repetition. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages include various roots (sliver-, snicker-, squonky, slurp-, slurry, Honing, Burr, brakkish, manxomely, honing-clangs, crunkled, gnarlsome, snickersnash, frogging, drone, Jabool, clap), indicating ≥4 distinct roots without dominance by single suffix. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly addresses a style and theme matching Jabberwocky, about a named creature “Honing” and “Burr” in fantastical confrontation, consistent with source poem topic (invented creature battle). Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: beyond surface, poem suggests motifs like initiation (child warned), confrontation of challenge, triumph, family approval; these layered undertones coherent and detectible.
