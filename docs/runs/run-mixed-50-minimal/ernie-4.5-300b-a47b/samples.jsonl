Total stanzas 6 is within 5–8 inclusive. All are quatrains.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Scan alternating longer and shorter lines with ≥2 content-word difference:  \n- Stanza 1: line lengths vary, but subtle differences, uncertain if ≥60% of stanzas meet strong alternating meter.  \n- Stanza 2: Mixed line lengths, likely no strong clear alternation.  \n- Stanza 3: Lines are closer in length, alternation unclear.  \n- Stanza 4: same.  \n- Stanza 5: line lengths less clearly alternating.  \n- Stanza 6: line lengths seem similar, no clear alternation.  \nOverall, strong alternating pattern in at least 4 of 6 (≥60%) stanzas not clearly present. No.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme check, focusing on lines (2,4) rhyme in ≥60% stanzas, avoiding AABB dominance:  \n- Stanza 1 rhyme: hide/stride (lines 1/2), moan/own (3/4) - likely AABB.  \n- Stanza 2: groaned/sown, smirked/inquiréd (inquiréd slant rhyme?), some slant rhyme but also AABB.  \n- Stanza 3: cabinets/ frets, bling / swing → lines 2 & 4 rhyme: frets/swing - no, these don’t rhyme, so no consistent rhyme on (2,4).  \n- Stanza 4: entwined/ bind, yowl/howl - lines 2 & 4 rhyme: bind/howl - no rhyme, but 2 & 4 lines are “dust motes spun, entwined” and “wardrobe yowl, jewelry howl,” actually (2) entwined and (4) howl - no rhyme and (4) howl is on line 4. Lines 2 and 4 do not rhyme here.  \n- Stanza 5: bright/night and (4) shade/glade (2 &4 rhyme? night/glade no), no.  \n- Stanza 6: still/drill and rug/hug - lines 2 & 4 rhyme: drill/hug no.  \nOverall, only first two stanzas have strong rhymes at 2 and 4; others do not. So <60%. No.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza does not echo the first stanza with ≥2 repeated content words or a clear refrain. Different content words and no mirroring lines or refrains visible. No ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>An early admonition or warning is present in stanza 2: “Beware the plinth” and similar cautionary lines. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation or armament before encounter: The poem shows movement of reglet through room, but no clear sign of preparation, taking tool, or resolved stance. No specific preparation text.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: Stanza 4 depicts action with “snicker-snack” sound from wardrobe and cabinet sounds, indicating a confrontation or encounter. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying or decisive action resolving tension: No clear decisive act or resolution shown; the poem ends with sleep and dreaming, no clear central tension resolved. No.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Final stanza suggests peaceful rest after events, but no explicit jubilant acknowledgement or return home described. No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count of distinct invented coinages occurring: Examples include chumblings, reglet, twickle, soofa, chairish, credenza, plinth, bulbous, waked (arguably standard English, but maybe used oddly), inquiréd, polish woods (possibly standard), untackled, bling, armoire, mystic swing, frellish, ottoman, buttressed (standard), snug.

Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coined word: chumblings, reglet, twickle, chairish, credenza, plinth, armoire, frellish, snicker-snack (canonical), frabjous, etc. Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>A named creature/entity distinct from canonical Jabberwock is central: “reglet” is the protagonist and the “furnishments” act as creatures; no distinct named adversary besides “plinth” (a furniture part). The “wardrobe” and \"chest of drawers\" are animate but no singular named adversary given. So “reglet” is the protagonist but no non-canonical creature named and central as adversary. No.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: “snicker-snack” is used once in stanza 4. Is there a second distinct onomatopoeic burst? “Yowl,” “howl” are not onomatopoeic bursts but sounds. “chuckled,” “groaned,” “grinned” - no clear second onomatopoeia words. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas:  \n- Stanza 1: chumblings'-shade, regi trinkets  \n- Stanza 2: cushions chuckled, springs sown  \n- Stanza 4: lampshade rippled, dust motes spun, painting grinned  \nClear alliteration or consonance evident in multiple stanzas beyond incidental. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>The arc beats (warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration) appear partially: Warning in stanza 2, encounter in stanza 4, but no clear preparation, decisive action nor return/celebration in canonical order. Arc incomplete or out of order. No.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line verbatim from canonical poem visible. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used: “Beware,” “snicker-snack,” “O frabjous,” “frabjous” (from canonical), “snicker-snack” (canon), “beware” (common), “O” (common), “snicker-snack” (canonical), but “snicker-snack” used once only. Canonical tokens ≤8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Check syllable count for lines in quatrain:  \n- Longer lines mostly 8–9 syllables (e.g., 8 in stanza 1, line 1), shorter lines 5–7 (typically).  \n- Some variations but mostly within approximate jabberwocky pattern. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety on (2,4) lines is poor; first 2 stanzas use the same rhymes or AABB pattern; others do not rhyme consistently. Rhyme variation is low with repeated end words (moan/own, groaned/sown), multiple stanza rhymes not varied. No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No content word is overused excessively; “reglet” appears several times but not >5 or >8%. Others vary. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages include reglet, chumblings, twickle, chairish, credenza, plinth, frellish, ottoman, etc., with different roots and suffixes. No single coinage suffix dominates >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem imitates Jabberwocky style with furniture and animate household items as entities, clearly in the spirit of Jabberwocky’s style and theme of a fantastic adversary quest. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Underlying theme of domestic fantasy and playful anthropomorphizing of household furniture, an undertone of whimsical interaction and dreamlike journey appears coherent. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Slightly borderline but stanza 5 lacks clear new coined words. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central (not Jabberwock): \"Blued screw\" is named adversary central to the poem.

No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas: Some limited alliteration present like \"blight and the blued\" and \"shriker’s rapping snare\"; perhaps stanza 1 and 3.

Some stanzas show more uniform length lines or no consistent alternate pattern. So criterion not clearly met.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme on lines 2 and 4 (slant rhymes allowed) in ≥60% of stanzas. Some rhyme pairs like flicker/kernel (no), mellow/fell (yes), shell/fell (yes), stops/greeting (no). Rhyme is irregular and no strong pattern of rhyming couplet on (2,4) in majority. Also AABB rhyme dominance is avoided but rhyme pattern not clearly ballad-like. So no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>No repetition of content words or phrases clearly echoing opening stanza in final stanza beyond generic thematic words (like “stubble”). No clear refrain present. So no ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>No admonition or warning to protagonist appears. No lines resembling “Beware…” or equivalent caution anywhere.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>No explicit preparation or arming before a confrontation; no protagonist with resolve or tools preparing.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>No clear encounter or confrontation. The poem describes murmuration of birds, but no meeting of protagonist and adversary or obstacle marked as a confrontation.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>No decisive act or slaying or tension-resolving event evident. The poem focuses on description and movement, not on action climax.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>No return, homecoming, or explicit celebratory acknowledgement. The poem's ending is calm, observational, no jubilation.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Check distinct invented coinages (not canonical or standard English). Coinages like “snicker” is standard, but “snicker-snack” canonical is absent. Distinct coinages include flitter-flack, frowsty, asphodel (a known flower, not coinage), ravy shell, curlicue, viral trouble (viral standard), micky-mock, micky-mop, wilding pluck us (wilding and pluck both standard?), clangs, murmurs, swoop (standard). Actually coinages appear sparse. Possibly 3-4 coinages but not 8 or more distinct invented words.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinages like “flitter-flack” and “micky-mock” appear in some stanzas, but many stanzas lack coinages. Some stanzas are more descriptive without coinages. So less than 1 per stanza.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>No named non-canonical creature or entity central to action. Only fuzzily “the flock” and “the stubble,” but no named creature as with Jubjub or Bandersnatch. So no.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts like “snicker-snack,” “Pop!” missing. Potential bursts: “clang” but it is mild, not exclamatory. “Chortle” appears but it is not onomatopoeic burst. So less than 2 clear onomatopoeic bursts.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Some stanzas show internal alliteration or consonance (“flitter-flack,” “frowsty,” “rustle mellow,” “curlicue, viral trouble,” “micky-mock, micky-mop”). At least 2 stanzas show clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>The narrative arc (warning, preparation, encounter, decisive act, return) is absent or out of order. The poem is descriptive and atmospheric without the canonical Jabberwocky arc.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line matches verbatim from canonical poem. Entirely original lines and phrases.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used are only “brillig” (line 5), “chortle” (line 29), and “snicker-snack” is not present; “chortle” appears once. “Brillig” count 1, under 8 total canonical tokens, so canonical budget is low.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Check syllable count roughly matches Jabberwocky quatrain pattern: longer lines ~8–9 syllables, shorter ~5–7 syllables, alternating. Patterns like “In twilight’s grip, a sky to snicker—” (8 sylls), “A flitter-flack of wings that flicker” (8), “Above the wheat that’s lost its kernel,”(8), “Where frowsty clouds begin to swirl.”(7). This stanza shows little alt pattern. Other stanzas mostly ~8 syllables all lines or not clearly alternating longer/shorter lines. So syllable tightness pattern weak or not consistently met.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Check rhyme variety: End rhymes of lines 2 and 4 mostly vary, no overuse of exact rhyme words >2 times. But rhyme uneven and partly missing. Likely yes for variety given no repeated rhymes >2 times.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guarding: content words appear with reasonable distribution; no word significantly overused that exceeds frequency threshold.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages present small number and not from one suffix; roots vary but total coinage is low so not applicable.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic is about murmuration, a flock of birds over stubble, quite different from Jabberwocky or similar battling theme. Not the canonical Jabberwock or similar creature. So topic adherence absent unless accepted as an abstract echo on Jabberwocky theme. Given criteria, no.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: poem suggests nature’s chaos, fleeting movement, ephemeral beauty, group mind — a somewhat coherent undertone or motif beyond surface action. So yes subtext is detectable.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>no</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>no</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

No clear prep. No.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: The poem describes the blade doing something (\"vault\", \"gnawed the night\"), but the protagonist encountering a named adversary or obstacle is unclear.

No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: With few rhymes overall and little repetition of end rhymes, but since rhymes are scarce and poor, rhyme variety cannot be judged as adequate. No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No overused content word found, no content word >5 times or >8%. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Since coinages <8 and limited in distinct roots, no sufficient coinage variety. No.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem about a blade called \"O1\", with motifs of \"grind\" and \"hollow,\" which aligns with a Jabberwocky-style poem about a creature/weapon. Topic not explicitly Jabberwock or exact canonical creature but fits the style.

Where has thee flown?  \nWithout thy gleam, we’re left alone,  \nTo wumble through the notes so trite,  \nIn this flimsical, unblinking night.”  \n\nThe gyre-enchanted moon looked down,  \nThrough boredom’s gloop upon the town,  \nAnd whispered, “Seek the slithy glave,  \nWhere only the silent tonebar brave.”  \n\nSo through the xoggle ever still,  \nBy way of burbill and of gill,  \nThe mandolin set, glum yet true,  \nHoping the tonebar’s path to pursue.  \n\nWith slithy vibrations deep in breast,  \nEach glimmer-flur behind life-pressed,  \nIt hummed a snicker-snack refrain,  \nTill heart and sound were one again.  \n\nThen came a chortle through the gloom,  \nA noise that fizzed the very room,  \nAnd there, on silvery crumpled glace—  \nStood tonebar! In radiant grace!  \n\nThey pressed together, side by side,  \nThe mandolin and tonebar tied,  \nIn harmony so bold and bright,  \nBlurping out a dappled light.  \n\nTogether they’d play, the two as one,  \nSinging through the slumbered fun,  \nA tune both wistful and unshackled,  \nAs boredom vanished, scattered and baffled.  \n\nSo remember well, in brillig’d hours,  \nWhen anxiety or silence powers,  \nCall forth your tonebar, true and rare,  \nAnd let your mandolin sing the air!", "info": {"topic": "mandolin tonebar"}, "reward": 0.6666666666666666, "label": "medium", "criteria_yes": 16, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.6666666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 0.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>Title line \"The Quest of the Mandolin Tonebar\" present before stanza 1, non-empty and separate.</C1_think>\n<C2_think>There are 10 stanzas, but only the first 9 stanzas are quatrains; the last stanza has 4 lines as well. Total stanza count (10) exceeds the allowed max of 8.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Most stanzas have inconsistent meter; the alternating longer/shorter line pattern with ≥2 content words difference in length is not clearly met in ≥60% of stanzas; meter is irregular and often lax.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme pattern in stanzas mostly follows a rhyme on lines 2 and 4, with occasional slant rhyme or imperfect rhyme; AABB dominance is avoided; (2,4) rhymes present in at least 6 stanzas out of 10 (60%) making the criterion borderline but likely met.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>No clear ring composition: final stanza does not echo the opening stanza with two repeated content words or refrains; the opening stanza and closing stanza share only thematic tone but no repeating content words or phrases.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>There is no explicit early warning or admonition equivalent to \"Beware...\"; poem is more a quest narration without cautionary tone addressing the protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation stage is implicit but not explicit; the mandolin sets out on its quest, but no clear armament or resolve explicitly described before encounter; the speaker \"called for tonebar\" but no detailed preparation as in canonical poem.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>There is an implied encounter at stanza 6 \"Then came a chortle... stood tonebar\"; clear meeting between mandolin and tonebar is presented.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>No decisive slaying or resolution of conflict; rather a reuniting/merging with tonebar; no central tension resolved by an act analogous to slaying; more of a harmonious resolution.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration are present at the end with \"Together they’d play\" and joyful tone; a kind of celebration of reunion.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages counted include: \"brillig’d\", \"frumious\", \"jumberluff\", \"wumble\", \"flimsical\", \"gyre-enchanted\", \"xoggle\", \"burbill\", \"snicker-snack\" (canonical), \"gill\", \"crumpled glace\", \"slumbered\" (possibly coined or uncommon), \"blurping\" - at least 8 clearly novel or adapted coinages excluding canonical ones.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Most stanzas contain at least one coinage or nonce word: e.g., stanza 1: \"brillig’d\"; stanza 2: \"jumberluff\", \"wumble\", \"flimsical\"; stanza 3: \"gyre-enchanted\"; stanza 4: \"xoggle\", \"burbill\"; stanza 5: \"snicker-snack\" (canonical); etc. So each stanza likely has ≥1 coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>The named non-canonical creature/entity centrally involved is the \"tonebar,\" a crafted musical character, central as protagonist's objective and companion; yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts present: \"snicker-snack\" (canonical), \"chortle\" (vocalization), \"blurping\" (invented sound), though \"chortle\" is more verbal rather than onomatopoeic burst, \"snicker-snack\" counts, \"blurping\" is an invented echoic word; at least two onomatopoeic bursts.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration and consonance concentrated in several stanzas, e.g. stanza 2: \"tonebar, jumberluff,\" stanza 4: \"burbill and of gill,\" stanza 5: \"snicker-snack refrain\"; at least two stanzas have clear within-line alliteration/consonance beyond incidental.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order is somewhat present but incomplete: no explicit warning; preparation implied; encounter present; no decisive killing action; celebration present; order roughly in canonical sequence but missing clear warning and slaying act.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines exactly verbatim from canonical poem; all lines original or paraphrased with new coinages or wording.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used include \"brillig(d)\", \"frumious,\" \"gyre,\" \"snicker-snack,\" \"whiffling\" (absent), \"borogoves\" (absent), \"mimsy\" (absent); mainly \"brillig,\" \"frumious,\" \"gyre,\" \"snicker-snack\" reused; no more than about 5 canonical tokens clearly reused, so budget ≤8 is respected.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts are variable and the longer/shorter line pattern (~8-9 and ~5-7 syllables) often not closely matched; not clearly met in most stanzas.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhymes on lines (2,4) vary but some endings repeat more than twice especially given limited proper rhyme sets; rhyme variety partially met but borderline given use of repeated rhyme words like \"alone\" and \"flown\"; still under 2 max per rhyme word not clearly exceeded.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word is overused excessively outside the ring echo (which is not present here); \"tonebar\" appears multiple times but not over 5 times or 8% of content words; repetition guard satisfied.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show multiple roots and suffixes: \"jumberluff,\" \"flimsical,\" \"wumble,\" \"burbill,\" \"xoggle,\" \"blurping\" reflect diverse coinage roots; no suffix dominates more than 50%; variety met.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic clearly consistent: quest for the \"tonebar,\" a musical artifact/creature, maintaining fantastical quest theme similar to Jabberwocky; no topic drift.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext is somewhat limited; narrative of unity, harmony overcoming loneliness or silence can be interpreted as motif; hints of anxiety and yearning suggest a modest coherent theme beyond surface action, but somewhat subtle.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>no</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Heads it cured!\" indicates a decisive action resolving conflict with foe.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: The protagonist calls to arms, “O frabjous day!” and “Gallumphing he cried!” with caroling nonsense, indicating celebratory return.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Distinct coinages: slurry, honing burr, sprong, xolbit, gloppish, glave, uggled, wried, and possibly more; at least 8 distinct invented coinages present.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinages distributed: each stanza contains at least one clear coinage or nonce word—e.g., slurry, honing burr, sprong, xolbit, gloppish, glave, uggled; coinages appear in every stanza.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: “Slurrywock” is named and central to action; “honing burr” appears as a location or entity; “xolbit” is foe-related term, but “Slurrywock” is primary creature.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: “snicker-snack” repeated at end, “chortled” as a sound, “gloppish” (suggesting sound), but fewer than two definite onomatopoeic bursts like “Pop!”, “Hiss!”; only one clear onomatopoeic burst (snicker-snack); second weak or uncertain.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Several stanzas show internal alliteration (e.g., \"gnarl and churr,\" \"burr-sharp claws scraped,\" \"frabjous day\") and consonance, clearly in multiple places.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning → Preparation → Encounter → Decisive → Return/celebration follows canonical order in model poem.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines exactly match canonical poem verbatim; some canonical words reused but lines altered.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Distinct canonical tokens used are ≤8 (e.g., vorpal, frabjous, wabe, whiffling, chortled, snicker-snack, galumphing, burr [unclear if canonical but used]; well within limit.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines approx 8–9 syllables, shorter lines approx 5–7 syllables: some variation observed; mostly lines fit approximate pattern; the last stanza (“...Is snicker-snack. The end. For her.”) is an outlier and very short; generally the pattern holds.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The rhyming words in lines 2 and 4 show some repeated rhyme sets (e.g., son/stun, hand/spanned, sound/cured, cried/wried), but no exact end word repeated more than twice; rhyme variety adequate.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overused excessively; the poem is short and diverse; no overused content word noted.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: ≥8 coinages with multiple distinct roots—not dominated by a single suffix; varied coinage roots (e.g., slurry, gloppish, sprong, xolbit, uggled, etc.) exceed 4 distinct roots.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-style monster slaying with a “Slurrywock” as central creature; style, theme, and narrative aligned with Jabberwocky spirit.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem’s undertone about a mixture of grittiness and nonsense, caution and triumph coherent with original poem; some implied motif of struggle and celebration, although subtle and less layered than original; coherent implied layer detectable.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}
