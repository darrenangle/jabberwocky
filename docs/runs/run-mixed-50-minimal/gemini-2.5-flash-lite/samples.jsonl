So, not all are quatrains, failing the quatrain shape requirement which demands all stanzas be 4 lines and stanza count between 5 and 8. Here stanza 2 is a sextet, failing C2.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Examining line lengths per stanza shows some alternation of longer and shorter lines, but the irregular stanza size (especially stanza 2) and inconsistent line lengths lead to less than 60% of stanzas clearly alternating line lengths with ≥2 content-word difference; borderline but not clearly yes, so answer no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme in the poem: the second and fourth lines rhyme or slant rhyme in majority of stanzas (e.g., gyre/dire, bright/night, stood/wood, snicker-snack/true [weak], glee/Chum?), but stanza 2 is irregular and with 6 lines, and stanza 5's rhyme is weak. Also, AABB dominance is minimal; mostly ABAB or ABCB style. More than 60% of stanzas have a second/fourth rhyme. So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes the first stanza fully with repeated content words and even identical lines except for some pluralization (\"screws\" vs \"screw\"). This is a clear ring composition, so yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Second stanza contains a caution \"Beware the blued screw, my son, the sharp one bright! / Beware the coglock...\", fulfilling the admonition requirement early in poem. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Second stanza shows \"He took his best wrench in hand\" and \"Long time the slow foe he scanned\" plus resting \"by the whirring stand,\" showing preparation before encounter. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>There is a clear encounter in stanza 4 between the protagonist and the blued screw: \"the blued screw, with teeth of hard wood, came whiffling through the gear-wood, and burbled as it came!\" Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action in stanza 5: \"One, two! One, two! And through and through / The blued screw went snicker-snack! / He left it there, with its fitting true,\" describing the decisive defeat of the blued screw. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration in stanza 6: \"And hast thou blued the screw, my son? Come to my arms, my keen-eyed chum! O frabjous day! Callooh!

Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>The poem invents coinages like \"blued,\" \"screw\" in unusual sense, \"coglock,\" possibly \"gear-wood.\" Counting distinct coined words beyond canonical lexicon: blued, screw (used figuratively), coglock, gear-wood, whirring stand (compound?), keen-eyed chum (maybe common English), spiral and dire (no). Approximately 4-5 coinages, less than 8. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Several (most) stanzas have some invented coinage or adapted wording (blued, screw, coglock, gear-wood), but because some stanzas rely on canonical or standard words, not 100% stanzas have at least one coinage. Possibly 5-6 out of 7; borderline but not definitively yes, so no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>The named central creature is \"blued screw,\" a non-canonical entity central to the action. The coglock is mentioned but as a secondary caution. So yes, creature/entity named and central.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Two onomatopoeic bursts: \"click and creak\" in stanza 1, and \"snicker-snack\" in stanza 5. Also \"burbled\" and \"whiffling,\" but those are from canonical. So at least two onomatopoeic bursts beyond standard words. Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>There is clear alliteration and consonance: \"blued, and the slithy screws,\" \"sharp one bright,\" \"coglock,\" \"keen-eyed chum,\" \"click and creak,\" “gear-wood.” At least two stanzas with clear alliteration or consonance beyond incidental. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>The arc of the narrative moves in order: admonition (stanza 2), preparation (stanza 2), encounter (stanza 4), decisive action (stanza 5), return/celebration (stanza 6). So canonically ordered arc is present. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Lines are mostly changed, though some repeated phrases from the canonical poem appear especially in ring composition stanza. No verbatim canonical lines other than repeated stanza with some morphological changes; no exact identical lines from canonical poem. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens appearing: slithy, mimsy, mome, raths, outgrabe, whiffling, burbled, snicker-snack, beamish, frabjous, callooh, callay — many reused in ring. The poem uses a fair number of canonical words but mostly ≤8 distinct tokens reused? Possibly slightly more than 8. Counting \"slithy,\" \"mimsy,\" \"mome,\" \"raths,\" \"outgrabe,\" \"whiffling,\" \"burbled,\" \"snicker-snack,\" \"frabjous,\" \"beamish,\" \"callooh,\" \"callay\" — more than 8 distinct canonical tokens evident, so no.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>The syllable pattern: longer lines ~8-9 syllables, and shorter lines ~5-7, seems roughly obeyed in stanzas but stanza 2 is irregularly long. Some violation but mostly close. Only borderline. But since we must be strict and stanza 2 breaks quatrain shape, no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety across stanzas seems decent, with line 2 and 4 rhymes changing: gyre/dire, bright/night, hand/scanned/stand/thought (in stanza 2 irregular), wood/come/gleam/true/creak/glee/chum differ moderate usage, none repeated excessively. Probably acceptable rhyme variety. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no single content word (other than ring echo) is repeated excessively. \"Blued\" used multiple times but not more than 5 times or 8% of content words, passed; \"screw\" repeated but integral to narrative and below threshold. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages appear, but do they have ≥4 distinct roots? From blued, screw, coglock, gear-wood, possibly movement/spiral/dire (arguably common English). Roots: blued, screw, coglock, gear. 4 distinct roots, yes with no suffix dominance. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>The poem addresses the topic of a parody of Jabberwocky with a \"blued screw\" as the adversary, matching the theme without substituting a different subject. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem implies a motif of mechanical struggle and triumph, a metaphor of tools and industry; an undertone of technical challenge and mastery beyond surface narrative. So a coherent implied layer is detectable. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied layer: The poem loosely implies a \"nonsensical hostile threat\" encountered and overcome by a hero. However, beyond surface action, only light undertones, not very strongly developed motif or subtext beyond original. Presence of quasi-subtext but borderline. The repetition of imitation style and creature naming suggests overall coherence. Slight but consistent undertone of bravery and whimsy consistent with Carroll’s style.

Most are quatrains, but the last stanza has 4 lines, so all stanzas have 4 lines. Total stanza count is 8, which is within 5–8. All stanzas are quatrains.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter alternation (long/short lines with ≥2 content words difference) checked in ≥60% of stanzas: This poem copies the meter of the canonical poem. Lines have alternating syllable counts matching Jabberwocky’s ~8/6 pattern mostly. 7 out of 8 stanzas clearly alternate longer/shorter lines with respective content word difference, so yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme: most stanzas have rhyme of lines 2 and 4, often slant rhyme accepted, no dominant AABB. About 7 out of 8 stanzas have correct rhyme (2,4). The final stanza’s rhyme scheme differs but overall meets requirement.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza partially echoes opening, but not fully—the canonical opening stanza is repeated verbatim earlier, final stanza only references \"The Reglet's gone...\" This stanza does not reuse ≥2 content words/phrases from opening stanza or provide a clear refrain. No clear ring composition based on echo or refrain.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present in second stanza: \"Beware the Reglet, my dear son!\" - a clear admonition to the protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before the encounter is present: protagonist takes \"vorpal sword in hand,\" \"long time ... sought\", \"rested ... Tumtum tree,\" \"stood awhile in thought.\" Same preparation arc as canonical poem.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation is clear: The Reglet with eyes of flame comes \"whiffling\" through the tulgey wood and \"burbled\" as it came.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: The \"vorpal blade went snicker-snack,\" the foe is left dead with its head, a decisive act resolving tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: The protagonist returns \"galumphing back,\" is called \"beamish boy,\" \"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\" He chortles in joy, matching canonical structure.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Very few non-canonical coinages (only \"Reglet\" is new; all other coinages are canonical—borogoves, toves, etc.). So fewer than 8 distinct new coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage distribution: Since only \"Reglet\" is new coinage and it appears in multiple stanzas, not every stanza contains a new coinage. Most coinages are from the canonical list.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature named and central to action is \"Reglet,\" which is non-canonical and replaces \"Jabberwock.\" So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: canonical onomatopoeic words (snicker-snack, whiffling, burbled) are reused, but no new onomatopoeia is added. There are ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts (snicker-snack, whiffling, burbled), so yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: multiple stanzas show clear alliteration and consonance, mirroring canonical usage (e.g., \"slithy toves,\" \"burbled as it came,\" \"beamish boy\").</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning, preparation, encounter, decisive action, return/celebration appear in canonical order without change.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim lines: Many lines are exactly the same as in the canonical poem (e.g., first stanza all lines, and many others). So verbatim canonical lines are present in the poem.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token budget is large: many canonical words reused (brillig, slithy, toves, borogoves, manxome, etc.), which exceeds 8 distinct tokens, disfavoring new coinages.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts: the poem copies the Jabberwocky line lengths exactly, so longer lines ≈8–9 syllables and shorter lines ≈5–7 syllables consistently in every quatrain stanza—yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The rhymes of (2,4) lines vary; although some repetitions exist, no exact end word reused more than twice (excluding ring echo). Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: Since much canonical lexicon is repeated, some words occur multiple times, but no content word overused >5 times outside the ring echo; overall acceptable.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Only one new root (\"Reglet\") for coinages, so fewer than 4 distinct roots in coinages, fails criterion.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem is a near copy of \"Jabberwocky\" but replaces \"Jabberwock\" with \"Reglet\" and ends with a stanza about furniture; the topic remains the original poem about a creature slaying, not shifting subject. Topic retained.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem largely repeats the canonical poem with minimal new subtext. The final stanza about furniture may add a mild ironic anti-climax, but coherent subtext or motif is weak or missing.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>"}

So yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter echo: In the canonical poem, lines alternate longer/shorter with ~8/6 syllables and distinguishable content word difference. Here, the lines generally have uniform length without clear alternating longer/shorter line patterns; differences in word counts and stress between lines 1 & 2 and 3 & 4 in most stanzas are minor or not clearly alternating. Less than 60% of stanzas demonstrate this clear alternating longer/shorter pattern.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme: Examine rhyme between lines 2 and 4. The poem mostly rhymes lines 2 and 4 reasonably (\"sight\"/\"moan\" no, but \"cried\"/\"hide\" yes; \"keen\"/\"deep\" no). Some stanzas have rhyme between 2 and 4 but others do not. The rhyme scheme is not consistently strong > 60% of stanzas with (2,4) rhyme. Also, no evidence of AABB dominance, but overall rhyme weak.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza repeats the phrase \"'Twas fid for splicing,\" echoing the first stanza's opening \"'Twas fid for splicing,\" and the poem essentially closes with the same opening phrase. At least two content words or phrases repeated (\"’Twas fid for splicing\" and \"four-strand\") between first and last stanza. So yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition: The second stanza contains an explicit warning \"Beware the clew,\" with cautionary lines, serving as admonition.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: The third stanza describes the protagonist taking the fid, sharpening it, and planning action (\"He took his fid, well-sharpened, keen; Long time the stoutest rope he’d seen.\"). Also, deliberate action of thrusting the fid deep before the main work. So yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: The poem has no confrontation with a creature or adversary; the \"adversary\" is abstract - the rope and the dangerous clew, but mostly this is a manual task, no clear meeting or struggle with a separate entity. Less clear than original. No obvious external \"enemy\". So no.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: There is a decisive action in the third stanza: thrusting the fid deep in the rope, and in fourth stanza continuing work with \"watched the strands,\" etc. The action resolves the tension of splicing. So yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: The last stanza shows completion, the rigging taut and ship made fast, implying success and readiness \"against the fury.\" Implied celebration or triumph is there. So yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: The poem does not contain invented words or neologisms; all words are standard English maritime or common words. So no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Since no coinages in whole poem, no coinage in every stanza.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: The poem names no creature or entity that is non-canonical or invented; the only \"named\" item is \"clew\" or \"fid,\" real maritime terms, not non-canonical fantasy creatures. So no.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: No onomatopoeic bursts, no sound imitations like 'snicker-snack' or 'burbled.' So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Some minor alliteration or consonance like “fid for splicing, four-strand” and “shrouds did twist, the stays did groan,” but these are mild and do not clearly stand out as intentional, repeated and strong alliteration in at least 2 stanzas. So no.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The canonical arc is warning → preparation → encounter → decisive action → return. Here we have warning (stanza 2), preparation (stanza 3), decisive action (stanza 3-4), and return/celebration (last stanza). But no clear confrontation/encounter stage with an opponent. This breaks arc order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: No lines exactly match anything in the canonical poem.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: The poem uses no canonical words (no brillig, toves, vorpal, etc.). Distinct canonical tokens = 0 ≤ 8. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines tend to be 7-9 syllables, shorter lines mostly 7-8 syllables, so no clear strong longer-shorter alternating pattern like ~8/6. Also many lines are similar length within stanzas rather than alternating longer/shorter. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhyme pairs are limited; some repeated rhyme words like \"hide\"/\"cold,\" \"seen\"/\"deep\" / \"sleep\" (slant); \"ring\"/\"bring\" in stanza 5. The rhyme endings are somewhat varied, no overuse >2 times for same rhyme (excluding ring). So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No overused repeated content word more than 5 times or 8%. Words are varied enough. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Since no coinages used, no variety. So no.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a theme of splicing (maritime rope splicing), corresponding to the given topic (none explicitly stated, but likely intended as a 'Jabberwocky'-style poem about splicing). The poem fits within the 'Jabberwocky' style task adaptation. So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is a subtle subtext/metaphor of careful preparation, danger, and resolution mirrored in the splicing task and rigging strength, but it is quite muted and less overt than canonical subtext of heroism and coming of age. So borderline, but mostly no coherent, recognizable subtext across whole poem.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>"}

Counting distinct coinages different from canonical lexicon: \"blued,\" \"wooing,\" \"tick-tack-tack\" (onomatopoeic sequence, may count as coinage), \"beaming sprite\" (possibly standard). Coinages seem fewer than 8 distinct new invented words excluding canonical and English. The poem strongly relies on a few English mechanical words and canonical lexicon. Coinage count is low.<br>Likely fewer than 8 distinct pure coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinages per stanza spread: Some stanzas include at least one coined or distinctive word (\"blued,\" \"wooing,\" \"whirring,\" \"buzzed,\" \"tick-tack-tack\") but not all stanzas clearly contain coined words. Not every stanza contains at least one coinage; probably less than 100% coverage.<br>Probably no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>The named creature/entity here is \"the cog,\" a non-canonical entity central to the poem's action and tension.

Coinages like 'Reglet' (named creature, non-canonical), possibly 'frumious' and classic canonical coinages present but no many new coinages. Later stanzas \"creak,\" \"sigh,\" \"whirr,\" \"entreat\" are standard English words. No new distinct invented words besides \"Reglet.\" Clearly < 8 coinages. No.</C12_think> Coinage spread: Later stanzas have no clear invented coinages besides the \"Reglet\" repeated. So not each stanza contains ≥1 coinage. No.</C13_think> Creature naming: Non-canonical creature named and central to action is \"Reglet\" replacing the \"Jabberwock.\" Yes.</C14_think> Onomatopoeia: Presence of onomatopoeic bursts? The poem contains canonical \"snicker-snack!\" and \"whiffling\" and \"burbled\" (all canonical). The last three stanzas no new onomatopoeic bursts. So at least two onomatopoeic bursts from canonical lexicon present. Yes.</C15_think> Alliteration/consonance: The poem uses alliteration notably in multiple stanzas (\"slithy toves,\" \"gyre and gimble in the wabe,\" \"frumious Bandersnatch,\" \"vorpal blade,\" \"snicker-snack,\" \"galumphing back\"). At least 2 stanzas have clear alliteration beyond incidental repeats. Yes.</C16_think> Arc order: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive → celebration sequence is well preserved in canonical lines with Reglet substituted. Yes.</C17_think> No verbatim lines? Most lines fully match the canonical poem except replacing \"Jabberwock\" with \"Reglet.\" Since lines otherwise identical, and verbatim matching lines aside from substitution count as verbatim? The instructions say \"Does no line EXACTLY match canonical poem.\" Lines copy the canonical poem verbatim except for \"Reglet.\" So majority of lines identical except substitution, thus verbatim lines present. No.</C18_think> Canonical budget: Given the poem uses canonical lines extensively (more than 8 canonical tokens), the limit ≤8 is exceeded. No.</C19_think> Syllable tightness: The first 8 stanzas replicate original, which uses ~8/6 syll pattern, so syllable tightness met in those stanzas. Later stanzas less clear but only last 3, overall still >60%. Yes.</C20_think> Rhyme variety: The (2,4) rhyme endings reused mostly only two or three times (\"wabe,\" \"outgrabe,\" \"catch,\" \"shun,\" \"flame,\" \"came,\" etc.) The last four stanzas introduce new rhyme pairs. No exact rhyme word repeated >2 times besides ring echo. Yes.</C21_think> Lexical repetition guard: Aside from canonical repeated words (\"the,\" \"and,\" etc.), no single content word overused beyond threshold. \"Reglet\" repeated as creature name but fine. Yes.</C22_think> Coinage variety: Only one clear root coinage: Reglet. No coinage variety across ≥4 distinct roots. No.</C23_think> Topic adherence: Clearly addresses the Jabberwocky theme, with Reglet as replaced creature, so consistent topic in style and subject. Yes.</C24_think> Subtext: The poem's extra last stanzas about furniture mourning the Reglet adds a subtle undertone of loss and residual fear, adding a coherent implied layer beyond surface action. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

The pattern avoids AABB dominance; mostly ABAB or ABCB. >60% stanzas have such rhyme.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza repeats the first stanza exactly (apart from some slight word form differences like “wobbly gears” and “wobbly gears” repeated), showing ≥2 repeated content words and a clear refrain effect, so yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present: stanza 2 begins with \"Beware the Blued Screw, my son!\" a clear warning/admonition.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation apparent: stanza 4 describes taking \"his vernier, keen and bright,\" seeking \"shifting gauge,\" resting and standing in thought before encounter, matching preparation phase.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter present in stanza 6, with Blued Screw appearing with \"eyes of brass,\" coming \"whiffling\" and making machine sounds; clear meeting between protagonist and adversary.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action in stanza 7: \"One, two! One, two! And through and through / The vernier went, with ghastly shriek: / He left it dead,\" describing clear decisive killing act resolving tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration in stanza 8: \"And hast thou slain... Come to my arms... O frabjous day!\" with joyous chortling; fits return and celebration beat.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Invented coinages: \"Blued,\" \"screw,\" \"flears,\" \"juban,\" \"whirle,\" \"vernier\" (arguable but mostly English), \"uffish\" (canonical), \"whiffling\" (canonical). Need ≥8 distinct coinages; counting new coined words: blued, screw, flears, juban, whirle, goo (could be standard but here odd), \"ghastly shriek\" is standard phrase. Only about 6 clearly invented terms. Therefore no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza has at least one coinage (“Blued screw,” “wobbly gears,” “chronos,” “flears,” “juban,” “vernier” [borderline but technical], “uffish,” “whiffling,” “ghastly shriek” [standard phrase])—mostly yes for coinage per stanza.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature named: Blued Screw is the named entity central to the poem (clearly non-canonical and central). Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"whiffling,\" \"whirred,\" \"clicked,\" \"ghastly shriek,\" but only “whiffling” and “shriek” strictly onomatopoeic bursts. Fewer than two clear bursts like “snicker-snack.” “ghastly shriek” could count. Borderline; two or more acceptable. So yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance visible in multiple stanzas: e.g. \"whirled,\" \"waking,\" \"wobbly gears,\" \"vernier, keen and bright,\" “gear that twists and grinds,” “ticking,” “stood awhile in thought.” Multiple clear alliteration instances in at least two stanzas; yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning in stanza 2 → preparation stanza 4 → encounter stanza 6 → decisive action stanza 7 → return/celebration stanza 8. Order matches canonical arc sequence; yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines from canonical poem: lines are all original or heavily altered, even common phrases are differently constructed. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens under 8: contains \"uffish,\" \"whiffling,\" \"beamish,\" \"gyre,\" \"gimble,\" \"wabe,\" \"mimsy,\" \"borogoves\" (some repeated canonical), but also many new words. Probably less than 8 distinct canonical tokens total; yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines approx 8-9 syllables, shorter lines approx 5-7. Checking: line 1 “’Twas blued and screw, and the wobbly gears” (9 syll), line 2 “Did gyre and gimble in the steam;” (7 syll) — fits pattern. Repeated across stanzas; yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: end rhymes (2,4) differ across stanzas without reuse of exact endings more than twice, except for ring echo stanza. (\"steam\"/\"dream,\" \"binds\"/\"grinds,\" \"song\"/\"sway,\" \"brass\"/\"pass,\" \"shriek\"/\"week,\" \"joy\"/\"Callay\") all mostly unique; yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: aside from ring echo, no content word seems overused more than 5 times or 8% of content words. Most words distinct or low frequency; yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coined terms come from at least four distinct roots: “Blued,” “screw,” “chronos,” “flears,” “juban,” “whirle.” No single root suffix dominates; yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly addresses a mechanical creature called the Blued Screw, a threat and its defeat; aligns with Jabberwocky topic of creature vs. protagonist. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: implied struggle of man vs machine, or industrial tension; mechanical imagery and caution; recognizable coherent undertone beyond plain action. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

So yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter echo: Checking alternating longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content words difference in line length for ≥60% of stanzas. The poem has no obvious alternating line-length pattern; lines seem more uniform in length, failing the alternating meter pattern.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme: In majority of stanzas, lines 2 and 4 rhyme.

Stanza 2 rhymes beware/snare/air/prayer (all rhyme) - yes; stanza 3 rhymes cloud/crowd/loud/shroud (full rhyme) - yes; stanza 4 rhymes sweep/deep/sleep/keep - yes; stanza 5 and 6 are repetitions of stanza 1 with rhyme present. The rhyme pattern is generally ABAB with 2,4 rhymes present. There is no obvious AABB dominance. So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza is a close echo of the opening stanza, with at least 2 repeated content words/phrases (\"’Twas glumphish,\" \"slithy toves,\" \"gyre and gimble,\" \"mimsy,\" \"borogoves,\" \"mome raths outgrabe\"). This satisfies ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning admonition: Second stanza includes \"Beware the stubble, friend, beware!\", clearly an admonition to beware some threat.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation armament: No stanza shows protagonist preparing or arming before encounter; no tool or resolve or plan is detailed.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter confrontation: No clear meeting or confrontation with an adversary or obstacle. The poem describes a murmuration, a flock phenomenon, but no protagonist adversary encounter is depicted.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying decisive action: No decisive act resolving tension appears; no action like slaying or killing or overcoming obstacle occurs.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return celebration: No return or homecoming or joyous celebration is present.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Check distinct invented coinages ≥8 and non-canonical. The poem uses \"glumphish\" (invented), \"murmuration,\" \"murmuring,\" \"glumphish\" is a coinage. \"Slithy\" \"borogoves\" \"mimsy\" \"mome\" \"raths\" \"outgrabe\" are all canonical, so no penalty there. \"Darkling\" is standard English, \"snare\" standard. \"Whispered\" standard. \"Murmuring\" standard or borderline. \"Stubble\" standard. So only glumphish is a strong novel coinage. Less than 8 coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza should contain at least one coinage. Only stanza 1 and last repetitions include \"glumphish\". None of the other stanzas have clear coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: No non-canonical creature/entity named and central to action. The \"stubble\" is an object and murmuration is flock, no named adversary.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: No bursts of onomatopoeic words like \"snicker-snack\" etc. No such words present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration consonance: Some mild alliteration e.g. \"murmuring, a silent prayer\" but not very strong; no 2 stanzas show clear within-line strong alliteration/consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The arc (warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration) is interrupted. There is warning, but no preparation, no encounter, no decisive act, or return. So arc order is incomplete and broken.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: The poem repeats canonical phrases like \"’Twas ... and the slithy toves / Did gyre and gimble ... / All mimsy were the borogoves / And the mome raths outgrabe,\" matching original lines almost exactly except for minor additions (\"with a shove\" and \"above\"). So close to verbatim lines; thus no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: The poem reuses canonical tokens many times, no major new tokens; within 8 canonical terms. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Lines similar in length, no strong alternating pattern of ~8–9 syllables and ~5–7 syllables lines; lines are mostly quite uniform and somewhat longer.

Since this is 5th stanza out of 6, borderline but likely no.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before confrontation: No clear protagonist preparing with tool or resolve before encounter; the poem narrates setting but no direct protagonist or preparation actions.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter or confrontation between protagonist and adversary: No clear confrontation; there is mention of \"third-rail hum\" and warnings, but no meeting or battle described.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive slaying or action resolving tension: No decisive action or resolution is described; tension remains ambiguous or atmospheric.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return or celebration: No return or joyful acknowledgment present; tone is ominous and meditative rather than celebratory.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: Count distinct invented coinages. Words like \"grummins\" and \"baleful\" (baleful is standard though archaic), \"Vipers\" (capitalized but standard word), \"whispered dark,\" not coined. \"Grummins\" is coined. Other coinages appear limited. At most 1-2 distinct invented coinages; less than 8.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Does each stanza contain ≥1 coinage? Most stanzas do not contain identified coinages except stanza 2 with \"grummins\" and stanza 4 with serpentine metaphor. Majority lack coinages. So no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named noncanonical creature/entity central to action: No named creature beyond metaphorical \"Vipers,\" which is standard word. No invented named creature present.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: No obvious onomatopoeic bursts such as \"snicker-snack,\" \"pop,\" \"hiss,\" or similar present; only \"hum\" from title and text but it is a noun, not burst; thus no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration or consonance beyond incidental repeats in ≥2 stanzas: Some alliteration (\"pulsed... whispered,\" \"grummins groaned,\" \"shadows ... shivered,\" \"silent power\") but mostly mild and limited. Only 1-2 stanzas have clear within-line alliteration, borderline but lean no for ≥2 stanzas.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order of canonical beats: Warning (maybe), preparation (none), encounter (none), decisive act (none), return/celebration (none). The arc is mostly missing or only vague. So no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: None of the canonical lines from the original Jabberwocky poem appear verbatim here; only different theme and wording.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexicon count ≤8: Canonical Jabberwocky lexemes (brillig, slithy, toves, etc.) do not appear except \"jabberwock\" or specific canonical words are absent. So canonical token reuse is zero, under 8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count in quatrains: Longer lines ~8–9 syllables, shorter lines ~5–7. Lines mostly long and uniform, no clear alternation of line lengths. Probably many lines have 8-9 syllables but without shorter lines interleaved properly. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhyme (2,4) is scant and mostly absent in stanzas; no repeated end words >2 times because rhymes are minimal. But rhyme is minimal overall, so variety is irrelevant. Cannot say yes if rhyme quality is poor. No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No evidence of overuse of any single content word beyond reasonable frequency; no repeated content word over 5 times or >8%. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Few coinages total, perhaps 1 or 2 distinct roots; no evidence of 4 distinct roots. No.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem is not addressing the original \"Jabberwocky\" topic but a different subject (third-rail electrical hum). Thus it does not clearly address the canonical Jabberwocky topic. No.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem shows a motif of caution around danger and mysterious power in a dark environment, so there is a coherent implied layer beyond surface description. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>no</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>no</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}
