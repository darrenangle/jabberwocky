Also, the last stanza is a verbatim repeat of the first stanza except \"mom\" instead of \"mome\". Thus, some canonical lines are present mostly verbatim or nearly verbatim. This violates the criterion.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Number of distinct canonical tokens used is greater than 8: the poem reuses many canonical words like brillig, slithy, toves, gyre, gimble, wabe, mimsy, borogoves, mome/mom, raths, outgrabe, vorpal, manxome, Tumtum, uffish, whiffling, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish, chortled, frabjous, Callooh, Callay, Bandersnatch, Jubjub etc. About a dozen or more canonical tokens reused. So distinct canonical tokens >8, failing the condition.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable pattern per stanza mostly matches Jabberwocky's roughly 8–9 syllables in longer lines and 5–7 syllables in shorter lines; majority of stanzas follow the expected meter.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: rhymes of lines 2 and 4 vary across stanzas without excessive repetition of the same rhyme word (>2 times). Although some original rhyme words recur, they do not exceed the threshold.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no content word (excluding canonical reused words) is overused beyond limits; no egregious repetition detected outside canonical opening/closing stanza echo.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: only two main coinages \"Reglet\" and \"Furnitobe\" with no significant suffix diversity. So fewer than 4 distinct roots or suffix varieties for the coinages.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>The poem addresses the original Jabberwocky topic clearly with the invented adversaries Reglet and Furnitobe; no substitution of unrelated topic.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext is consistent with Jabberwocky’s implied motifs of a coming-of-age challenge, battle against fearsome foes, and return triumphant; maintained throughout.</C24_think>\n</think>\n\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Clearly a ring composition with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases. So yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present in second stanza: \"Beware the Tonebar, oh my son!\" so an explicit caution. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before encounter shown: \"He took his plucky axe in hand; Long time the tonebar-foe he sought—So rested he by the tuning stand, And deep in thought he thought.\" Clear resolve and waiting/preparation. So yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter in stanza 4: “The Tonebar, with its scrape and squeal, Came whiffly through the carven wood,” etc.; protagonist faces adversary. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action in stanza 5: \"One, two! One, two! And through and through / The whirly pick did flick! / He left it glaggy, stuck with glue,\" showing a clear act resolving tension. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration in stanza 6: “And hast thou slain the Tonebar, pray? / Come to my arms, my beamish boy! / Oh, frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! / He chortled in his joy.” Clear jubilant acknowledgement. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented coinages: twangling, strummy, mandoriffic, rimes (borderline but used creatively), tonebar, plucky, tonebar-foe, whiffly, glaggy, whirly, flick (common but used poetically), clacky, sticky, frilly, fretful, snatch (some are standard words or common suffixes). At least 8 distinct clear coinages well beyond canonical or standard English. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage or invented/formative word: e.g. tonebar, mandoriffic, twangling, whiffly, glaggy, whirly, plucky. Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named: \"Tonebar\" named and central antagonist, not canonical. \"Picky-grib\" mentioned but less central. Tonebar is central figure of poem’s conflict, so yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"whiffly,\" \"whirly,\" \"flick!\" and sounds like \"click,\" \"scrape and squeal\" but only one clear burst with exclamation is \"flick!\" Only 1–2 borderline onomatopoeic words present; \"flick!\" is a burst, \"click\" also onomatopoeic but muted. Slightly borderline, but at least two reasonable onomatopoeic bursts: “One, two! One, two!” (imitative), and “flick!”, plus “click.” So yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration and consonance beyond incidental: stanza 2 (\"clacky, sticky, catch!\"), stanza 5 (\"glaggy, stuck with glue\"), stanza 1 (\"strummy chimes\"), and stanza 4 (\"scrape and squeal\"). At least two stanzas clearly with alliteration. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning/admonition (stanza 2), preparation (stanza 3), encounter (stanza 4), decisive act (stanza 5), return/celebration (stanza 6) in correct order. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines exactly match canonical poem lines; wording changed extensively and no verbatim occurrences. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens: beamish used once, frabjous, callooh, callay, chortled, son, jaws, claws, shun, with \"Jabberwock\" replaced by \"Tonebar,\" \"Picky-grib\" instead of Jubjub/Bandersnatch; fewer than or about 8 canonical words or tokens used. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts roughly conform to Jabberwocky pattern per stanza quatrains: longer lines around 8–9 syllables, shorter lines about 5–7 syllables; pattern consistent in most stanzas. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: multiple rhyme endings in (2,4) lines without excessive repetition; no more than twice any rhyme ending word reused excluding ring echo. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word is overused visually or nutritionally; words like \"tonebar\" occur appropriately but not excessively; lexical repetition is guarded. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages are varied: at least 4 distinct roots in coinages (twangling, mandoriffic, plucky, glaggy, whiffly, etc.); suffixes and roots not dominated by one form. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly on theme of an invented creature \"Tonebar,\" an antagonistic entity analogous to Jabberwock; does not substitute unrelated subject; so yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem carries implied undertone of a musical or stringed instrument battle (mandolin tonebar as foe), a musical combat metaphor, which is coherent beneath surface narrative. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Line length alternating pattern holds in all stanzas (≥60%).</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme pattern: lines (2,4) rhyme in all stanzas with exact rhymes preserved (“wabe/outgrabe”, “catch/Bandersnatch”, etc.).

No ≥8 distinct new invented coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Coinages only appear in canonical first stanza and its repeat (and scattered in a few other stanzas), but each stanza does contain at least one canonical coinage or known word. Since no new coinages invented, coinages present but only canonical ones.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: The creature named is “Splicing-Snark,” which is non-canonical (not Jabberwock) and central to the poem’s action.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia present: “snicker-snack!” and “burbled” both retained from original and considered onomatopoeic bursts, at least two onomatopoeic words.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Original alliteration preserved in several stanzas (e.g. “slithy toves did gyre and gimble,” “whiffling through the tulgey wood”).

This poem duplicates entire lines exactly from Jabberwocky (the canonical poem lines are reused without modification).

No overuse beyond canonical pattern; rhyme words repeated but rhymes vary adequately with no ending repeated more than 2 times except ring echo repetition.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: Since many lines repeated verbatim from canonical poem, some content words (e.g., “brillig,” “toves,” “borogoves”) are repeated frequently but these are canonical and allowed. No overuse beyond canonical poem’s repetition pattern.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Only canonical coinages used; canonical coinages have multiple distinct roots preserved (brillig, slithy, toves, mimsy, borogoves, mome, raths, Jubjub, Bandersnatch, vorpal, manxome, Tumtum, uffish, tulgey, snicker-snack, beamish). More than 4 distinct roots present overall.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly addresses the same topic as Jabberwocky but replaces the “Jabberwock” with “Splicing-Snark.” No topic substitution.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Because poem is a near copy of original with only creature name swapped, the implied undertone and motif remain intact and coherent as in canonical poem.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Here, line lengths vary more widely, e.g. stanza 1 line 3 (whiffle-whiffle grind began) is short, but others like line 4 “As in a workshop dreamed” is about 6 syllables, line 1 about 7. Overall it does not strongly match Jabberwocky’s tight meter pattern.

Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses an abstract meta-theme of shaping a blade with an antagonistic force called “Hollow-Grind,” which parallels the adversarial encounter in Jabberwocky. The poem sticks to the topic of a menacing force and crafting a blade. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is a coherent implied layer about craft, struggle, shaping perfection, danger, and art in the workshop. This is a detectable motif across the poem.

So no.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter: stanza 4 describes the verglas cracking and the Grickle-lick sliding and sliding off; this is an adversary meeting; yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: no explicit slain or killed verb; the verglas melting, and Grickle-lick leaving the granite; implies resolution but no direct action by protagonist (no \"he did X\" decisive act mentioned). So borderline but no.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: stanza 5 celebrates \"frabjous day! Calooh! Callay!\" and melting with dawn, suggesting a triumphant return or joy after event. So yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Counting distinct coinages: verglas-grip, wibbled, slipp’ry-slip, Grickle-lick, skitter-skatter, Nible-sack, shimm’ring-dream, orang-gleam, crystal-rack, skitt’ring, frosty maze (compound but \"frosty\" may be standard), wibbled, writhed (standard?), liquid glassy flow (standard); around 8+ distinct invented coinages present prominently. So yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage: stanza 1 (verglas-grip, slipp’ry-slip, Grickle-lick, skitter-skatter, Nible-sack), stanza 2 (shimm’ring-dream, orang-gleam), stanza 3 (crystal-rack), stanza 4 (skitt’ring, Grickle-lick), stanza 5 (verglas-grip). So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Two creatures named besides Jabberwock: Grickle-lick and Nible-sack, both central to caution and action; Grickle-lick is central to the sliding encounter. So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"crack\", \"skitter-skatter\", \"skitt’ring\" and expressives like \"smack\"; at least two onomatopoeic bursts present (\"crack\" and \"skitter-skatter\" notably). So yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance notable in stanza 1: \"slipp’ry-slip\", \"skitter-skatter\"; stanza 4: \"slid and slithered, wibbled, writhed\"; stanza 2 lesser but still internal consonance; thus at least 2 stanzas have clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats. So yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning/admonition (stanza 1) → observation (stanza 2, weak prep) → encounter (4) → decis ive act (none explicit in 4 or 5) → celebration (5); prep weak and no explicit decisive action, so arc beats partially out of canonical order; likely no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines verbatim from canonical poem; all wording different; no exact copy. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens present: \"Beware\" (canonical), \"frabjous day\", \"Callooh!

The slipp’ry-slip! It wibbled in the chill!\"), shorter lines 5–7 syllables (\"Beware the Grickle-lick! The crack! The skitter-skatter fright!\"); consistently maintained across stanzas. So yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: rhyme pairs in stanza 1 (chill/fright/night), stanza 3 (crack/track), stanza 5 (gone/dawn) are distinct; no rhyme repeated >2 times; so yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word excessively repeated; \"verglas-grip\" used 2 times, \"Grickle-lick\" 2–3 times; overall no word >5 times or >8% content words; so yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage roots: verglas, slipp’ry, Grickle, lick, skitter, skatter, Nible, sack, shimm’ring, orang, gleam, crystal, rack; at least 6–7 distinct roots, no single suffix dominates >50%. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem centers on a “verglas-grip” event analogous to Jabberwocky’s monster, with named creatures and a challenge; topic clearly related, not substituted. So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent motif: metaphor for slippery danger and overcoming natural hazard; undertone of cautious approach to peril and triumphant survival; consistent implied layer detectable.

Counting careful: \"brillig,\" \"mimsey,\" \"gyre,\" \"gimble,\" \"uffish,\" \"snicker-snack,\" \"beamish,\" \"whiffling,\" \"burbled\" = 9 canonical roots here. Exceeds the budget slightly, so no.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Lines show sizes around Jabberwocky's ~8/6 syllable pattern.

So yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter is less obvious. No clear meeting with an adversary or creature. The opponent could be metaphorical \"grind-burr\" but it's more about the grinding process. The poem focuses on sharpening, not a confrontation with a creature.
