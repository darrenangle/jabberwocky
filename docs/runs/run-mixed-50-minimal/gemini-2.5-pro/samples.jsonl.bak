The meter mostly alternates with appropriate line length differences; roughly 5+ and 8-9 syllables alternate fairly consistently in majority of stanzas, suggesting approximate success in ≥60%, so yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme: Rhyme (2,4) in quatrains mostly holds, even allowing slant rhyme. Rhyme pairs include “wabe/outgrabe”, “grey/shun”, “hand/thought”, “dreme/came”, “air/light”, “arms/tune”, “wabe/outgrabe.” Not AABB dominant but rather ABCB type rhyme predominantly with some slant. ≥60% of stanzas meet (2,4) rhyme; so yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The last stanza repeats the first stanza verbatim except replacing “groves” → “mem’ry-coves” but the distinct content words “’Twas yearnsore, and the slumbrous groves / Did wist and wither in the wabe; / All mimsy were the mem’ry-coves, / And the mome raths outgrabe.” The head and tail stanzas match with ≥2 content words repeated and clear refrain effect. Yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition: Second stanza features a warning: “Beware the Hiraeth-wist, my son!” and warnings about “Shadesong” and “Yester-haze!” An admonition is clearly present early. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: The protagonist “took his vorpal sword in hand” and “Long time the mourngloom foe he sought— / So rested he by the Tumtum tree / And stood awhile in thought.” This is preparation before encounter. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: The poem has a stanza describing the meeting: “And, as in uffish thought he stood, / The Hiraeth-wist... Came whiffling through the timetangled wood...” Clear encounter present. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: The decisive cutting action is subverted: “The vorpal blade, it felt no bite, / It swished no snicker-snack in air; / For wisps of glimfeather and pale light / Were all that wandled there.” No killing or a decisive slaying, but a null action; this lacks a clear decisive resolution. No.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: No stanza describes the protagonist returning triumphant or celebration. Instead, he is “wrapped in its home-holm arms” and “lost his way,” indicating defeat or absorption rather than jubilant return. No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Count distinct invented words not from canonical or standard English (distinct coined root-like units): yearnsore, slumbrous, wist, mem’ry-coves, Hiraeth-wist, grimsigh, fademist, Shadesong, frumious (canonical), Yester-haze, mourngloom, dreme, timetangled, glimfeather, wandled, sighdamp, past-glim, home-holm. There are well over 8 distinct new coined forms excluding canonical; yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza has at least one coinage—e.g., “yearnsore”, “slumbrous groves”, “mem’ry-coves”, “Hiraeth-wist”, “mourngloom”, “dreme”, “timetangled”, “glimfeather”, “wandled”, “sighdamp”, “home-holm”, “past-glim”. Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: A named entity is “Hiraeth-wist,” a non-canonical creature central to the confrontation. “Shadesong” and “Yester-haze” appear as possible creatures or entities but the “Hiraeth-wist” is primary adversary. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Canonical onomatopoeia from original include “snicker-snack!” and “burbled”. Here, “snicker-snack” is mentioned as a negated event (“felt no bite... no snicker-snack”) so it occurs but negated. “Burbled” is used in stanza 4 (“And burbled as it came”). So at least “burbled” is present, plus negated “snicker-snack”. Only one clear onomatopoeic burst; no other bursts like “pop!”, “hiss!”, etc. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Examples include “wist and wither”, “mourngloom foe”, “past-glim moon”, “sighdamp, ancient tune”, and “timedangled wood”. At least two stanzas show clear within-line alliteration or consonance beyond incidental. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Tone alignment: Tone is whimsical, playful, mythic, with fantasy-neologisms and mysterious mood consistent with Jabberwocky style. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: The poem repeats the last stanza almost verbatim from reference, but that stanza is used as ring composition; otherwise no verbatim lines from the well-known middle stanzas. The exact final stanza is repeated from original except modified coinages. This counts as ring echo but not verbatim copy outside ring; so yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Canonical tokens used: slithy, mimsy, mome, raths, outgrabe, frumious, vorpal, uffish, whiffling, burbled, snicker-snack (negated, so minimal), Tumtum, wabe; many canonical tokens (around 11-13). This is more than 8, so no.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: The longer lines approximate 8-9 syllables, shorter lines ~5-7 syllables fairly consistently through stanzas, e.g., stanza 1 lines about 8/6/8/6 syllables. So this fits the Jabberwocky meter pattern. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes vary across stanzas with no exact end word repeated >2 times except the ring echo. The poem varies with “outgrabe”, “wabe”, “grey/shun”, “thought/dreme/came/air/light/tune” etc., so rhyme variety is good. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No overused content word beyond 5x or 8%. Content words like “mome”, “raths”, “outgrabe” repeated only in ring echo; no excessive repetition overall. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages show ≥4 distinct roots: yearnsore, slumbrous, wist, mem’ry-coves, Hiraeth-wist, grimsigh, fademist, Shadesong, Yester-haze, mourngloom, dreme, timetangled, glimfeather, sighdamp, home-holm, past-glim. Clearly diverse roots and suffixes; no dominance of one suffix >50%.
