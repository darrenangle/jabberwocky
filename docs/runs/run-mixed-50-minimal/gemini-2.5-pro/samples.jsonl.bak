no AABB dominance; appears to meet rhyme criterion in at least 3 of 4 stanzas (~75%).</C4_think>\n<C5_think>No evident ring composition; final stanza does not echo the opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words or refrain.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition: no explicit warning or caution to protagonist is evident in poem text; no \"Beware\" or similar phrase.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>No protagonist or preparation of armament or resolve evident before encounter; poem is more atmospheric with no clear hero action.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>No clear protagonist/adversary meeting; poem mostly describes a setting and mysterious \"zoltish rail\" humming, but no visible encounter or confrontation.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>No decisive action or slaying evident; no resolution of tension or central conflict.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>No return or celebration or homecoming stanza present.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages present: “Gloam-Gride,” “zoltish,” “thrumble,” “hummadroning,” “shockful,” “gride,” “vibrulant,” “gribblins,” “glummony,” “sullied,” “hum”—several coined or altered words, easily ≥8 distinct invented coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains ≥1 coinage: stanza 1 (“zoltish”), stanza 2 (“hummadroning,” “shockful,” “gride,” “vibrulant”), stanza 3 (“gribblins,” “glummony,” “sullied”), stanza 4 (“hum,” “grumbling”) - yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>No explicitly named non-canonical creature/entity central to action; \"gribblins\" is close but these seem more like background creatures, not central protagonist or antagonist; no foe named.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: words like “thrumble,” “hummadroning,” “hum,” and “grumbling” imply sound or noise but classical onomatopoeia bursts like “snicker-snack!” or “Pop!” lacking; fewer than 2 clear onomatopoeic bursts.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Some alliteration and consonance: e.g., stanza 2 “hummadroning,” “shockful song”; stanza 3 “gribblins,” “ballast,” “chittered,” “crept,” “chittered” and “crept” evoke consonance; but less than 2 stanzas with strong within-line alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats; possibly borderline, lean no.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: no clear sequence of warning → preparation → encounter → decisive action → return; poem is atmospheric without narrative arc; no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines exactly verbatim from canonical poem; all lines rewritten with different words.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Uses canonical tokens “mimsy,” “all” (common English), but very limited canonical lexicon usage overall (≤8 canonical tokens); meets criterion.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: lines roughly 6-8 syllables for longer lines, 5-6 for shorter lines; no strong evidence all longer lines are 8-9 and shorter lines 5-7 consistently; borderline no due to shorter overall lines.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: rhymes are similar but do not reuse exact end words more than twice; rhymes vary across stanzas; meets criterion.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word overused excessively; vocabulary variety maintained.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show multiple distinct roots: \"zoltish,\" \"hummadroning,\" \"gribblins,\" \"shockful,\" \"gride\" are distinct lexical roots; no single suffix dominates >50%; meets criterion.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem evokes a mysterious creature or force (\"Gloam-Gride\") and a setting reminiscent of Jabberwocky, but does not clearly address original subject or analogous topic of a heroic encounter with named creature; topic partially met but not clearly matching Jabberwocky-style narrative.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: some atmospheric undertone of impending threat or eerie setting detectable, but no clear coherent motif or layered subtext across poem; minimal subtext.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>no</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>no</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>"}

Counting distinct invented words excluding canonical, we have roughly 7-8 (plimbic, wox, Scrivenote, haspen-catch, flimsifold, grangled, grithsome). Exactly 8 would be borderline but at least 7 distinct coinages; borderline but overall 8 is arguable. However \"frumious\" is canonical, \"uffish\" and \"mimsy\" canonical also. So barely 7 new coinages distinct. So fails ≥8.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza contains at least one coinage (e.g., plimbic, wox, frumious, Scrivenote, haspen-catch, flimsifold, grangled, grithsome, uffish, mimsy). All stanzas have some coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: A named adversary or creature? \"Scrivenote\" is named and is an adversary to beware of; but central action is with flimsifold (an object), not creature. The Scrivenote is somewhat a creature/entity concept; borderline but counts as a named adversary. The cedar wox is an entity but more like a place or object (title and opening line). So yes, Scrivenote is named and central to admonition.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: No evident onomatopoeic bursts such as “snicker-snack” or “burbled”. No such bursts present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: At least two stanzas show alliteration or consonance: stanza 1 \"cedar wox / dusty sleep\", stanza 5 \"mimsy moan\", \"grithsome, silent call\", \"felt heavy stone\" shows consonance; stanza 2 \"scrivenote / sears\", \"fierce and wild\" etc.; so yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning > preparation > encounter > decisive action > return. Here: warning (stanza 2), preparation (stanza 3), encounter (stanza 4-5), no decisive action (no slaying), no return/celebration (last stanza hides sorrow). So arc is incomplete and ends prematurely; order roughly preserved, but whole arc not present. So no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: Some canonical words present (\"mimsy\", \"uffish\"), but no exact line repetition from canonical poem, so yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Used mimsy, uffish, frumious, and a few canonical words; total unique canonical ≤4, within budget.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines roughly ~8 or 9 syllables (e.g. stanza 1, line 1 \"’Twas plimbic, and the cedar wox\" = 8 syllables; shorter lines 5-7 syllables; generally met.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhyme in 2nd and 4th lines varies across stanzas (\"sleep/locks\", \"sears/years\", \"catch/latch\", \"lie/dry\", \"moan/call\", \"lid/hid\"); no overuse of end words >2 times; yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No content word overused (>5 times or >8%); no problematic repetition seen.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: At least 4 distinct roots: plimbic, wox, Scrivenote, haspen-catch, flimsifold, grangled, grithsome; suffix-only coinages are not dominating; yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The topic is the style of Jabberwocky, not a specific different subject. Here the poem introduces a mysterious object and named adversary akin to Jabberwock.

No protagonist agency explicitly preparing.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: No clear meeting or confrontation with adversary occurs. The poem hints at the \"Glissic-sheen\" and \"Crissle-shard\" and \"slither-track\" but no clear encounter stanza or confrontation is described.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: No decisive action or slaying described. No kill, no resolution described; third stanza is descriptive of glissic sheen and frozen landscape, lacking action.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: No return or jubilant celebration stanza present. The poem ends with repeated morning imagery, no joy or celebration.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Distinct invented coinages count as unique coined words not in canonical lexicon and standard English. Coinages include: crisping, morn-gloom, skritch, bouldren, fridgerous, verglas, cling-fast, craggedy, glissic-sheen, crissle-shard, slither-track, graintled, glumph, skeerling, flintering, shiver-slaked. Definitely ≥8 distinct coinages present.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage in each stanza: Each stanza has at least one invented word (stanza 1: crisping, morn-gloom, skritch, bouldren, fridgerous; stanza 2: glissic-sheen, crissle-shard, slither-track; stanza 3: graintled, glumph, skeerling, flintering; stanza 4: glissic sheen, shiver-slaked, bouldren). So yes, each stanza has ≥1 coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named and central to action: \"Glissic-sheen\" is the named non-canonical creature/entity in the warning and referenced through the poem. So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Onomatopoeic bursts like \"snicker-snack\" are required in ≥2. No obvious onomatopoeic words such as buzzy or hiss or pop; no bursts or sound imitations present. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Some alliteration like \"craggedy peaks\", \"cling-fast\", \"fridgerous verglas\", \"shiver-slaked\", but not clearly concentrated in ≥2 stanzas with strong effect beyond incidental. Borderline but probably no strong pattern of alliteration/consonance in multiple stanzas.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning in stanza 2; no clear preparation in stanza 3; no encounter; no decisive action; no return/celebration. Arc beats incomplete and not in canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: No exact line matches canonical poem lines. All lines are original or heavily modified.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Words like \"Beware\", \"the\", \"my son\", \"the teeth that bite\", \"and shun\" are canonical but very limited canonical tokens used: no canonical coinages like 'brillig' or 'slithy' present, only limited standard words. Presumably ≤8 distinct canonical tokens.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines should be ~8–9 syllables; shorter ~5–7. The poem's lines vary: first stanza lines about 8–9 syllables with some longer (e.g. line 1: ’Twas crisping, and the morn-gloom day — 8 syllables; line 2: Did skritch upon the bouldren high —7 syllables; line 3: The fridgerous verglas cling-fast lay — 8 syllables; line 4: And craggedy peaks did pierce the sky — 8 syllables). But no consistent alternating longer/shorter pattern and some longer/shorter lines not tightly controlled. Close but uneven; borderline, safer to say no since strictness requires every quatrain show pattern.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme across stanzas is weak and limited. Some rhyme or near rhyme in stanza 1 (high/sky), stanza 2 (son/shun), but reused rhyme pattern in multiple stanzas; rhyme endings seem reused frequently. So no clear variety and no strong avoidance of repeated rhyme endings.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No obvious word overused (estimation: \"the\" frequent but function word, no content word overused >5 times or >8%).</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages include multiple distinct roots: crisping, morn-gloom, skritch, bouldren, fridgerous, verglas, cling-fast, craggedy, glissic, sheen, crissle, shard, slither, track, graintled, glumph, skeerling, flintering, shiver-slaked (at least 10 distinct roots). No single suffix dominates >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses an invented creature \"Glissic-sheen\" with a warning and a landscape, following a similar theme to the original poem about a creature and an adventure. So topic adherence yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond surface action, limited coherent implied subtext or motif present; the poem is descriptive with no clear motif or emotional arc across entire poem. Slightly atmospheric but no clear subtext or undertone. No strong detectable subtext.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>"}
