The model uses varied meter but the difference in content words and line length is not clearly evident in ≥60% of stanzas. Possibly borderline but not clearly met. Answer no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (2,4) pattern check with ≥60% stanza compliance and no AABB dominance: Stanzas mostly have lines 2 and 4 rhyming or near rhymes (e.g., “fly” / “sky”, “friend” / “bend”). Some rhymes are approximate/slant but allowed. At least 5 of 7 stanzas have (2,4) rhyme. Acceptable rhyme pattern with no AABB dominance noted (few have ABCB-like). So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza echoes the opening stanza with repeated lines “’Twas brillig in the workshop nook... And fruminous sparks did fly” and similar phrases repeated exactly or closely. There is ≥2 content word/phrase repetition. Clear ring echo present. Yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Admonition: The second stanza contains “Beware the Hollow Grind, my friend! The whetstone sharp and sly! Beware the Hollow Grind’s keen bend, And shun the dull reply!” which is an explicit early warning/admonition. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: The third stanza shows the protagonist taking his belt of leather fine, seeking edges, resting by grindstone’s shine, sharpening as legends taught – clear preparation before encounter. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: Fourth stanza “And as in uffish thoughts he stood, The Hollow Grind did sound! One, two! One, two! The blades he good— With flashes all around!” indicates a confrontation or action with the Hollow Grind (encounter). Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: The lines “One, two! One, two! The blades he good— With flashes all around!” imply cutting/sharpening; the action is less literal slaying but is decisive: blades sharpened (resolved tension with the grind). The final fifth stanza celebrates the honing and gleaming edges, which suggests decisive resolution. Accept as decisive action. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Fifth stanza “O frabjous day! The grind did gleam! He honed the edge anew; With careful hand and gleaming beam, The hollow whispers flew.” expresses celebration/jubilant acknowledgement after the action. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: The poem uses some canonical coinages like “brillig,” “slithy,” “uffish,” “fruminous,” “frabjous.” Also “hollow grind” is coined for the poem. However, the total distinct invented coined words is around 4-5 counting “fruminous” (close to canonical?) and “hollow grind.” Not ≥8 distinct coinages. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage distribution: Coinages appear in several stanzas (e.g., fruminous, slithy, uffish, frabjous, hollow grind), but not necessarily one per stanza. Some stanzas lack clear coinage. So no, not every stanza contains ≥1 coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: The poem names “Hollow Grind” as a central entity/obstacle, non-canonical and central to the action, distinct from Jabberwock. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: The poem uses “One, two! One, two!” which could be rhythmic counting but not clear onomatopoeia bursts like “snicker-snack” or “Pop! Hiss!” No other explicit onomatopoeic bursts present. So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance beyond incidental: Some internal alliteration such as “fruminous sparks” and “sharp and sly” and “honed the edge anew” present but not strongly repeated at stanza level. Only 1-2 instances, not clearly ≥2 stanzas with strong alliteration/consonance. No.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning (2nd stanza), Preparation (3rd stanza), Encounter (4th stanza), Decisive action (4th-5th stanzas), Return/celebration (5th stanza) appear in canonical order. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: No exact lines from the canonical “Jabberwocky” poem verbatim; some canonical words reused but no exact entire lines identical. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Canonical tokens are brillig, slithy, and uffish, frabjous, and mome (in original poem), but this poem only uses a few canonical coinages: brillig, slithy, uffish, frabjous, and fruminous (derived?). Total canonical tokens ≤8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines tend to be mostly 9–11 syllables (e.g., “And fruminous sparks did fly,” “Did shimmer ‘neath the sky;”), shorter lines 4–7 syllables. The poem’s meter roughly approaches Jabberwocky’s ~8/6 pattern but not tightly controlled; some lines exceed ideal length range. Not tight in every stanza. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhyme words for (2,4) lines vary across stanzas: “fly”/“sky,” “friend”/“bend,” “fine”/“shine,” “stood”/“good,” “anew”/“flew.” No end word is repeated more than twice (excluding ring echo). Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No word appears heavily repeated above 5 times or 8% of content words. Lexical variety is maintained. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: The coinages present: brillig, slithy, uffish, frabjous, fruminous (adjective possibly coined), hollow grind (compound coinage). Roots roughly 3–4 distinct bases—“frum-,” “brillig,” “slithy,” “hollow grind.” Not ≥4 fully distinct roots in coinages. No.</C22_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>", "judge_error": "worker_error: process_row() takes from 7 to 8 positional arguments but 9 were given"}

Line 3: “All flimflam ropes in curl unrolled,” about 8 syllables. Line 4: “Did prang and pling and bop and spring;” about 7 syllables. The alternating meter is not very clear. Syll count and content-word difference don't create clear longer/shorter lines alternating pattern with 60% compliance.

Reuse of rhyme end words minimal. Last stanza repeats first stanza's words. No exact end word reused >2 times outside ring echo.

Poem ends with Snorfling lost in a \"dimpy shade,\" and the Nargle lying there. No explicit slaying or victory described, so no decisive act.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>No return/celebration present; ending is rather somber and unresolved; no joyous homecoming or acknowledgment.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Counting coinages: wuzzlewock, frumious, Snorfling, wimbly-wombled, fizzleweed, flindleflumps, Snogglewump, grumpling, Gindlebeer, Snogglebatch, borplebark, Thumbleband, glim, glim(?), whiffling (canonical), whaffling, brim, snorp, dimpy, Nargle, enhance(standard).  \nAt least 10 unique invented coinages (excluding canonical or standard English).

So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia needed 2+ bursts: Examples like “whiffling” is canonical but used, “whaffling” could be onomatopoeic, “snorp” is onomatopoeic, but only one or two candidates present. Probably just barely meets the ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts (snorp and whiffling).

Only a few canonical coinages used (brillig, frumious, whiffling).

Not strict but borderline met in some stanzas. Since it is required for all quatrains, and some lines miss the shorter line target, answer no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: With only 2 stanzas actually rhyming (2 and 4 lines), and rhymes repeated: “prance/dance” and “prance/enhance” are repeated end rhymes used more than twice.

No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word overused heavily; \"Snogglewump\" occurs multiple times but less than 5 times overall; no overuse of any content word beyond 8%.

All stanzas have 4 lines.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter alternation: Lines generally alternate between longer and shorter lines, but some lines (e.g., “Clattered on the clinking string”) quite similar length—meter alternation not strongly evident in ≥60% of stanzas. Marginal or borderline, but no clear ≥2 content words difference line to line in at least 4 stanzas. So likely no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme pattern: Most stanzas show rhyme on lines 2 and 4 with slant rhyme (“string”/“Clingcring”, “son”/“tight”, “sound”/“around”), avoiding dominant AABB—no AABB pattern present. Rhyme on (2,4) in ≥60% stanzas holds, allowing slant rhymes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Final stanza matches first stanza almost verbatim with repeated content words “brillig”, “glimble keys”, “mimsy”, “clattered clang!”, so ring echo definitely present.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition: Present in stanza 2 with “Beware the clankle Keyring, my son! … shun the Tangle-tight!” a clear cautionary admonition.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: Protagonist takes a “trusty jing-jang blade” before the encounter, indicating armament/preparation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: Protagonist finds the Keyring in the gloom “A-rattling all around”, a clear confrontation scene present.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: Yes, stanza 5 has a decisive act: “One, two! One, two! And through and through / The jing-jang blade went snick! / He left it dead...”, a clear resolution.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: No clear jubilant homecoming or celebration stanza; final stanza is a ring echo but no celebration language. No “O frabjous day!” or joy expressed.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: “Clingcring,” “glimble,” “clinkling,” “snatchy,” “Sproing-sprang,” “Tangle-tight,” “jing-jang,” “snick,” “clinging click” – at least 8 distinct noncanonical coinages present, counting compounds.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Most stanzas contain at least one coinage word—e.g., stanza 1: “glimble”, “Clingcring”; stanza 2: “clankle”, “Sproing-sprang”, “Tangle-tight”; stanza 3: “clinkling”; stanza 4: “snick”; stanza 5: “clinging click”; so ≥1 coinage present in each stanza.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: “clankle Keyring” and “Sproing-sprang” both creatures/enemies. Keyring is the adversary here. The “clankle Keyring” is a named entity and central to the poem’s action.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Examples like “clattered clang!”, “snick!”, “clinging click” qualify as onomatopoeic bursts. At least two present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Multiple stanzas show alliteration beyond incidental, e.g., “clattered clang”, “clinking string”, “snatchy Sproing-sprang”, “clinging click”, showing clear consonance/alliteration in at least 2 stanzas.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning (stanza 2) → Preparation (stanza 3) → Encounter (stanza 4) → Decisive Action (stanza 5) → Return (stanza 6) matching canonical order, though return is only ring echo without celebration. The arc beats appear in correct order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: Most lines are changed from canonical except a few phrases like “’Twas brillig” or “All mimsy were the...” repeated exactly in ring stanza. However, the ring stanza is reused but allowed. No other verbatim lines beyond ring; the ring echo is part of the canonical pattern and allowed. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token usage: Uses canonical words “’Twas brillig,” “mimsy,” “borogoves” not present but “mimsy” and “brillig” present; total distinct canonical tokens ≤8 (brillig, mimsy used, none more except “’Twas” as a function word). So canonical budget respected.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Lines mostly fit 8-9 syllables on longer lines and 5-7 on shorter lines approximately, though a few lines like “He took his trusty jing-jang blade,” (8 syllables) and shorter lines like “And sought the clinkling sound;” (5 syllables). Mostly fits Jabberwocky’s meter pattern in all quatrains.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: End rhymes on (2,4) vary across stanzas (“string”/“Clingcring”, “son”/“tight”, “sound”/“around”, “snick”/“click”, etc.) no rhyme repeated more than twice, rhymes are varied.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: Content words generally not overused; “clink/clank” and “cling” variants appear but less than heavy frequency threshold; no single content word exceeds usage limits outside the ring stanza.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages have multiple distinct roots: “Cling-”, “glimble”, “clink/clang”, “snatch-”, “Sproing-sprang”, “Tangle\", “jing-jang”, “snick”.
