So no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter alternation requires ~60% of stanzas with alternating longer and shorter lines.

The alternating meter pattern found in \"Jabberwocky\" is not consistently followed here. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme (2,4) following a ballad quatrain pattern is not reliably present. The first stanza is 5 lines and rhymes only partially (\"nook\"/\"look\"/\"fly\"/\"sly\"/\"reply\"), mostly an AABAB pattern.

Yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>The second stanza includes an admonition: \"Beware the Hollow Grind, my friend! The whetstone sharp and sly!

Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>The direct encounter with the adversary (the Hollow Grind) is somewhat vague. The Hollow Grind \"did sound\" and \"One, two! One, two! The blades he good— With flashes all around!\", implying a confrontation. This qualifies as an encounter/confrontation. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>There is no decisive slaying or breaking of the adversary, but a honing or sharpening action that resolves tension: \"O frabjous day! The grind did gleam!

Total coinages are low, about 2-3 distinct new words, not 8 or more. So no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Not every stanza contains coinage.

Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeic bursts like \"snicker-snack\" or other exclamations are missing. The poem has \"One, two! One, two!\" but this is rhythmic, not onomatopoeic bursts. No evidence of ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts.

So yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines match the canonical poem verbatim. All wording is adapted or changed. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used are \"brillig\", \"slithy\", \"uffish\", \"fruminous\" (new), but \"fruminous\" is a new coinage.
