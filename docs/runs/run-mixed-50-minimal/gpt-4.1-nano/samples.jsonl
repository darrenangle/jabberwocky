Possibly only one clear canonical onomatopoeia (\"snicker-snack\"), unclear if at least two distinct onomatopoeic bursts appear. \"jabber-jagged\", \"whack\", \"snicker-snack\", \"whizzle-thack\" may imitate sound but are coined words, not clearly obvious onomatopoeia bursts like \"Pop!\" or \"Hiss!\".

Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: This poem is more descriptive and atmospheric, without clear canonical arc beats found in Jabberwocky (warning, preparation, encounter, decisive action, return). It has a late warning (3rd stanza) but no other stages. Arc order incomplete.

Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: lines vary in length, some shorter, some longer, but no clear 8–9 vs 5–7 syllable alternating pattern in ≥60% stanzas.
