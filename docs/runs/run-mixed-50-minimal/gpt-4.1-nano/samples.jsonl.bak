The poem's lines are mostly similar in length; at glance: some lines too long or short, e.g., stanza 1 line 3: \"And the tremmish, with a wistful, wharble-sigh,\" has about 11 syllables; generally uneven syllables and no clear alternating longer/shorter pattern. The syllable pattern is inconsistent.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety in (2,4) positions across stanzas: (2,4) rhyme words are \"whiffled\"/\"wifled\"; \"Flearbeem\"/\"dreem\"; \"way\"/\"stray\"; \"gleam\"/\"dream\" — four rhyme pairs, all different rhymes except \"dreem/dream\" are direct rhymes but from different stanzas, so total rhyme variety is good with no excessive repetition.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: Check for overuse of any single content word outside ring echo (which is absent): Words like \"wistful,\" \"dream,\" \"hiraeth\" appear only 2-3 times max; no sign of one word >5 times or >8% content words, lexical repetition guard is respected.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety by roots and suffixes: Coinages include many different roots (e.g. brunchly, wogglers, wharble-sigh, Flearbeem, flummoose, dull-buv-dreem, querbling) with no dominant suffix or root accounting for >50%, so variety is sufficient.</C22_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>"}

So no.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>No decisive act or slaying resolving tension. No mention of battle or fight. So no.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>No return or celebration stanza, no homecoming or joyful conclusion. So no.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented coinages (non-canonical, not standard English): blibber-blabber, jazzle-womp, zindle-zangle, deadhead drimbles, squibber-squam, nether-glee zip, whomper-wham, flibber-flobber, gluc-glee, zappy, sproon, glimble-glam, moonpops, frindlefam, wibble-wobble, snizzled, rumbly-bumbly, zindle, dream-drench, etc. Easily ≥8 distinct creations. So yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains ≥1 coinage:  \n1st stanza: blibber-blabber, jazzle-womp, zindle-zangle, squibber-squam, whomper-wham  \n2nd stanza: flibber-flobber, gluc-glee, zappy, sproon, glimble-glam, moonpops, frindlefam  \n3rd stanza: wibble-wobble, snizzled, rumbly-bumbly, zindle, dream-drench  \nSo each stanza has coinages. So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creature/entity central to action (other than canonical 'Jabberwock')? The poem centers on a “deadhead drimbles” or “deadhead run” but “deadhead” is not canonical and “drimbles” seems to be a creature/entity. Despite “deadhead” usually known as a term unrelated to Carroll, here it is used as a coined creature-like term. So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia? Examples like “snicker-snack” or “burble” or “hiss” required. The poem has “snips and snaps” in line 5; “snips and snaps” can be onomatopoeic bursts. “Zappy claps” might be mildly suggestive. No other clear onomatopoeia bursts (like \"Pop!\", \"Hiss!\") are present clearly. Only one onomatopoeic phrase strongly. So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance beyond incidental in ≥2 stanzas?  \n1st stanza: “blibber-blabber,” “jazzle-womp,” “zindle-zangle” — strong alliteration and consonance  \n2nd stanza: “flibber-flobber,” “gluc-glee,” “zappy claps,” “glimble-glam,” “moonpops,” “frindlefam” — noticeable alliteration and consonance  \n3rd stanza: “wibble-wobble whim,” “snizzled swan,” “rumbly-bumbly” — alliterative  \nAt least 2 stanzas with strong alliteration/consonance. So yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Tone is whimsical and playful, with nonsense words and invented terms giving a mythic, whimsical feel. Matches Carroll’s tone. So yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line exactly matches canonical lines from Jabberwocky. All lines are original, full of new coined terms. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens (e.g., brillig, slithy, toves, etc.) present ≤8 times? The poem has no canonical tokens from the standard lexicon extracted from original Jabberwocky. Hence canonical budget is ≤8. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable pattern: longer lines ≈8–9 syllables, shorter lines ≈5–7; alternating lines in quatrains.  \nCheck stanza 1:  \nLine1: In the blibber-blabber haze of jazzle-womp,  \nCounting syllables: In(1) the(1) blib-ber(2)-blab-ber(2) haze(1) of(1) jazz-le(2) womp(1) ≈11 syllables  \nLine2: Where zindle-zangle voices softly stomp,  \nWhere(1) zin-dle(2) zan-gle(2) voi-ces(2) soft-ly(2) stomp(1) ≈10 syllables  \nLine3: A deadhead drimbles through the squibber-squam,  \nA(1) dead-head(2) drim-bles(2) through(1) the(1) squib-ber(2) squam(1) ≈10 syllables  \nLine4: On a nether-glee zip, a whomper-wham!  \nOn(1) a(1) ne-ther(2) glee(1) zip(1) a(1) whom-per(2) wham(1) ≈10 syllables  \nNo clear evidence of alternating longer/shorter lines with distinct syllable targets 8/6; rather lines are all fairly long and uniform. So syllable pattern fails the tightness test. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety of (2,4) line endings across stanzas:  \nRhyme (2,4) in stanza 1: “jazzle-womp” / “whomper-wham” — slant rhyme, different endings  \nStanza 2 no rhyme (snaps / frindlefam)  \nStanza 3 no rhyme (air / care)  \nSo rhyme is not well established or varied. Also line endings are not repeating excessively since rhyme is weak and sparse. So yes for variety, but given majority stanzas no rhyme, overall strictness suggests no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition check: No single content word is overused >5 times or >8% of content words. Words like “deadhead” appear twice, “zindle” twice, others once. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: There are many distinct coinage roots: blibber, blabber, jazzle, womp, zindle, zangle, drimbles, squibber, squam, whomper, wham, flibber, flobber, gluc, glee, zappy, sproon, glimble, glam, moonpops, frindle, fam, wibble, wobble, snizzled, rumbly, bumbly, dream-drench. Definitely ≥4 distinct roots and no single suffix dominates. So yes.</C22_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>no</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>"}

Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Are distinct canonical tokens ≤8?  \nMentions \"jabber\" once (in line 12), no other canonical unique words like 'brillig', 'toves', etc. So canonical tokens ≈1 or 2 ≤8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines ~8-9 syllables, shorter lines ~5-7 syllables in every stanza?  \nExample stanza 1 line lengths (estimate syllables):  \n1) Beware the Twingle-awl, ye zomber-foes (9) longer  \n2) The snickert, the snuzzle, the sharp-blade glows (9) longer  \n3) With a flick-flack he pecks in the gribbled gloom (10) longer  \n4) In the twerking dark of the blebberish room (9) longer  \nAll lines long, no clear longer/shorter alternating lines or shorter lines ~5-7 syllables; all closer to 9-10 syllables. No evidence of Jabberwocky syllabic pattern. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Are (2,4) end rhymes varied across stanzas with no exact end-word reused >2 times?  \nIn 3 stanzas: rhymes mostly distinct; repeats of \"plan\" and \"tan\" rhyme only once, \"glows\" \"foes\" twice in stanza 1. No overuse. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: Outside ring echo, is no content word overused (>5 times or >8%)?  \nNo excessive repetition detected; unique nouns and verbs vary widely. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Do coinages show ≥4 distinct roots (no single suffix >50%)?  \nCoinages have multiple distinct roots: \"Twizzlewhack,\" \"Twingle-awl,\" \"snickert,\" \"snuzzle,\" \"gribbled,\" \"blebberish,\" \"Owlange,\" \"bliz,\" \"snice,\" \"wimbly,\" \"Glibber-gabble,\" \"spindweeb,\" \"Garkle,\" \"frobbled,\" \"crembles,\" \"whibbity.\" Multiple different coinage types.
