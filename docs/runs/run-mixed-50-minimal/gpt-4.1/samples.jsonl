Lines mostly vary but not consistent or strong rhythm alternation in most stanzas; borderline but not clearly ≥60%.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme in lines 2 and 4 in most stanzas: slate/pate, sheen/earth’s unseen (slant), paced/ungraced (exact), thread/tread, sprawled/mauled, cried/inside, slate/pate. No AABB dominance (some quatrains rhyme 2,4 only). So rhyme pattern mostly met and variation adequate.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza closely repeats opening stanza verbatim with identical content words (rimmled, spickle, slate, etc.)—clear ring composition with refrain.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Second stanza includes \"Beware the verglas, slippery-sheer!\", an explicit admonition to be cautious early on.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Third stanza shows protagonist taking \"swaddle-soled galosh\", pacing over stones, indicating preparation with gear and resolve.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Fourth stanza marks encounter with \"verglas shimmering\", \"came whiffling coldly\", an obstacle meeting protagonist.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Fifth stanza has decisive action: slip, fall (\"ker-clash!\"), struggle (\"blurfed mittens\"), then rise (\"mauled!\"), resolving tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Sixth stanza shows return and celebration: others praise (\"O slipperous star!\"), protagonist safe and warm indoors, joyful tone.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Distinct coinages: frinline, rimmled, spickle, flinters, whingled, blitsome, pebbgraph, bewrinkle, twindling, jazglen, slip-thap, snither-hopes, blurfed, mauled, slipperous; at least 15 distinct invented words.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza includes at least one coinage, e.g., frinline stanza 1, bewrinkle stanza 2, swaddle-soled stanza 3, jazglen stanza 3, snither-hopes stanza 3, blurfed stanza 5, slipperous stanza 6, pebbgraph stanza 1 & 7.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creature/entity? No named creature like the Jabberwock or others; the poem centers on \"verglas\" (thin ice). While \"verglas\" is a real word, in this poem it represents a malevolent obstacle, but it's not a coined or fantastical creature name, rather a natural hazard. So no non-canonical creature named as in original poem.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: ker-clash! is a clear onomatopoeic burst; \"whiffling\" echoes Carroll’s onomatopoeia. Only one strong burst; \"blurfed\" and \"mauled\" are coined verbs but not onomatopoeia. So only one certain onomatopoeic burst.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance seen within lines: \"rimmled frost\", \"spickle and spin\", \"sharp flinters\", \"swaddle-soled galosh\", \"jazglen stones\", \"slip-thap hungered\", \"blurfed his mittens\", \"polished boots\", multiple stanzas have notable alliteration.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (\"Beware the verglas\"), preparation (gear and pacing), encounter (seeing verglas), decisive action (slip and fall), return/celebration (safe inside, praised). So arc beats in canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line is verbatim from the canonical poem; wording is original.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used: whiffling, snicker-snack (no snicker-snack), vorpal (no), and other canonical words? Only \"whiffling\" present (canonical), but in the poem it's in fourth stanza. No other canonical tokens from the reference poem besides \"whiffling\" possibly. So canonical tokens ≤8.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable distribution similar to original poem’s ~8/6 pattern mostly respected. Longer lines often 8-9 syllables, shorter lines 5-7 syllables fairly consistently in each quatrain.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: repeated rhymes like slate/pate repeated twice, but used only twice total at opening and closing stanza (ring echo allowed). Other rhymes (unseen/earth's unseen, paced/ungraced, thread/tread, sprawled/mauled, cried/inside) mostly unique or not repeated. So rhyme variety well maintained.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word is overused; repeated words are usual (like \"verglas\") but not exceeding 5 times or 8% content words; safe lexical repetition.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show multiple distinct roots: frinline, rimmled, spickle, whingled, flinters, pebbgraph, bewrinkle, twindling, jazglen, slip-thap, snither-hopes, blurfed, mauled, slipperous—well beyond 4 distinct roots; suffix usage diverse.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly about a hazardous icy condition (\"verglas\"), winter danger, slipping and falling, matching the theme of an adversarial encounter in nature like the Jabberwocky’s hunt. So topic clear and adhered to.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem implies a cautionary tale about danger and perseverance through natural obstacles (icy hazard), with some undertone about preparation, fate, and human struggle against environment. There is a coherent implied layer and motif about caution and overcoming. So subtext present.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Many of these may be real words or very lightly coined; clear coinages: whipplebred, shivened, whirring (standard), grapple (standard), filmy (standard), steelcuts (compound), honning burr (named creature), spiral tree (named location), galumphed (variant), bubulous (new coinage), splay in unfamiliar sense, slurry (standard word). Count of obvious invented coinages is about 6–7; borderline under 8 distinct true coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage or nonce word: stanzas include gritty, whipplebred, Honing Burr, shivened, galumphed, bubulous, splay, Slurry, etc., so all have some unique coined or rare terms.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named and central: \"Honing Burr\" is a named adversary, distinct from canonical “Jabberwock”, central to action.

No dominant suffix accounts for >50% of coinages. Wide variety of coinage roots and affix types.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem addresses a splicing/nautical/adventure topic clearly and consistently through the poem invoking rigging terms (fid, splice, ropes), naming adversarial “Splinderknot,\" preserving theme of confrontation and victory. It matches a “Jabberwocky”-style fantasy but applied to the topic of rope splicing; thus on-topic as given (assuming topic is poem in Jabberwocky style). No topic substitution.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext beyond surface action exists: motif of skilled craftsmanship, tension and triumph in mastery over a knot/obstacle, underlying meaning of overcoming challenge and working with nature's elements metaphorically. Poem retains undertone of mastery, effort, and cautious respect akin to original “Jabberwocky” style.
