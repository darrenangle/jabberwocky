More than 2 stanzas have noticeable alliteration/consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Tone: whimsical and mythic, with playful invented words and mystical mood fitting Carroll's style.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines from canonical poem; all lines original wording and coinages distinct.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token usage minimal or none: no canonical tokens like \"brillig\" or \"vorpal\" appear; canonical token count ≤8, probably 0 here.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts in longer lines around 8–9; shorter lines around 5–7 mostly; overall syllable pattern approximates Jabberwocky’s tighter meter moderately well.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: various end rhymes with no exact end word reused more than twice (if at all); rhymes vary stanza to stanza reasonably.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: no content word overused excessively outside ring echo; no obvious repeated word >5 times or >8% except expected repeated \"Cedarwock\" once or twice.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: about 9 distinct coinages from differing roots; suffixes well varied, no overdominant suffix.</C22_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>"}
