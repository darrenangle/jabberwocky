Mostly uniform line length and style, so no strong ballad meter echo.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme pairs at lines 2 and 4 show approximate rhymes in most stanzas (e.g., glow/rise/disguise, dusk/shroud/unbowed, hand/ought/strand/thought, etc.). However, many rhyme pairs do not neatly rhyme or slant rhyme, and some look off. Also, no strong evidence of avoiding AABB dominance (no direct AABB rhyme pattern, mostly ABAB or ABCB). So rhyme(2,4) present in most stanzas but slant quality is borderline.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza repeats the exact first stanza (except title lines); so final stanza is a clear ring echo with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases (\"’Twas twilight-time\", \"velum glow\", \"twirl and weave\", \"moontide's rise\", \"thorny boughs\", \"whispered winds\"). Clear refrain present.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Second stanza contains a clear admonition starting with “Beware the glowing cloud at dusk!”, an early warning to the protagonist, matching the instructed admonition form.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Third stanza shows preparation by protagonist: “He took his telescope in hand”, “Long time to quest the sky he sought”, “So rested he amid the strand”, “delved into the thoughts he ought”—this matches preparation/armament before encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation is ambiguous: stanza 4 describes \"And as the velvet brink unfurled... Came shimmering through the silver world...\", which seems to represent the target of the quest appearing, so a figurative meeting of protagonist with the object of pursuit, but no direct conflict or clash. Meeting is more observational than confrontational but a clear encounter is implied.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>No decisive slaying or violent action resolving central tension; the poem is more about watching and observing than killing or fighting. The \"One, two! One, two!\" stanza depicts night growing and waves dancing, no decisive act ending an adversary. So no decisive action present.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>No explicit return or celebration; stanza 6 invites the dreamer to wander and appreciate the beauty but no triumphant return or jubilant acknowledgement is shown. The mood is contemplative and peaceful, not celebratory.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Distinct invented coinages: “velum”, “moontide”, “thorny boughs” (not coinage but normal), “twilight-time” (compound), “zephyr’s shroud” (zephyr is standard English), “dreamer’s fervent husk”, “quiet gleam”, “faintly luminescent”, “glist’ning”, “twilight e’en”, “crested waves of ether”, “night unspanned”. Many words are standard English or poetic compounds, no unique novel coinages on par with Carroll’s invented lexicon. Coinages <8 distinct novel words, most are normal poetic words or known words. So no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains no evident unique coinage; mostly standard English or known compounds and poetic expressions. So no stanza reliably includes a coined word per stanza.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>No non-canonical creature/entity is named or central. There is a vague \"glowing cloud at dusk\" and \"dreamer's fervent husk,\" but no invented creature or named adversary different from canonical Jabberwock or its variants.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>No onomatopoeic bursts (e.g., no “snicker-snack”, “Pop!”, “Hiss!”) or other bursts of sound imitative words present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Limited alliteration or consonance. Some soft repeats (e.g., \"twilight-time\", \"twirl and weave\"), but no strong alliteration beyond incidental. No 2 stanzas with clear within-line alliteration or consonance beyond incidental repeats.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza 2), preparation (3), encounter (4), decisive act (5 - no slaying or decisive action), return/celebration (6 - no jubilant return). Decisive action and return are weak or missing, so arc order is incomplete or partially broken.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines verbatim from canonical poem or matching exact canonical lines. All words and phrases are different except the repeated stanza is original to this poem.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens (e.g., “vorpal”, “Jabberwock”, “galumphing”) do not appear at all, so canonical token count is zero, well under 8. Favors new coinages but few actually.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Line syllable counts approximate ballad meter? The lines are generally longer and fairly uniform; line length closer to 8–10 syllables in most lines, shorter lines not reliably 5–7 syllables as Jabberwocky uses. The alternating line length pattern is not clear and at least 40% of stanzas lack distinct longer/shorter alternating lines. So fails syllable tightness.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: many stanzas repeat rhyme words or similar word endings across stanzas (e.g., glow/rise/disguise repeated, dusk/shroud/unbowed). Some rhyme endings repeat more than twice. So rhyme variety is low with reused rhyme endings exceeding 2 times.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: no single content word or coinage overused beyond 5 times or >8% of content words (words like \"twilight,\" \"glowing,\" or \"night\" appear multiple times but not excessively). So yes, no overuse.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: very few clear coinages; most words are standard English or poetic compounds; no >4 distinct roots of coined words; coinage suffix patterns minimal. So no coinage variety.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem clearly addresses a \"Jabberwocky\"-style topic: a mystical nighttime encounter/adventure theme consistent with the style's whimsy, and it evokes a similar narrative arc about a protagonist on a quest involving a supernatural phenomenon. So yes, topical adherence to a Carroll-like poem is given.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext or coherent implied motif: the poem suggests a motif of wonder, exploration, nighttime mystery, possibly meditation on seeking/observing mysterious forces. There is a coherent undertone of reverence for nature and cosmic beauty, so a subtle but real subtext present.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Total stanza count is within 5-8. So yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter echo: Checking line lengths and content words: most stanzas show longer/shorter line alternation, but less clearly with ≥2 content-word difference. At least 5 of 8 stanzas have alternating longer/shorter lines; so ≥60%. Yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme: Most stanzas rhyme lines 2 and 4 with slant rhymes (\"high\"/\"by\", \"brittleice\"/\"twice\", \"light\"/\"fright\", etc.), and AABB is avoided. More than 60% stanzas have required rhyme pattern. Yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza does not clearly echo the first stanza using ≥2 repeated content words or a refrain; some similar imagery (winter, peace), but no clear ring echo or repeated phrases. No.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition: An early stanza includes the admonition \"Beware the Glisterfang, my child!\". Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: The protagonist is described holding a spear and pausing to listen before heading onward—this indicates preparation/resolution. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: There is a clear meeting as the protagonist approaches and fights the Glisterfang with his \"sparrow-lance\". Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: The decisive act occurs in stanza 7 with \"One, two! One, two!

Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: The poem centers on a named non-canonical creature \"Glisterfang\", distinct from canonical creatures mentioned (Jabberwock, Bandersnatch, etc.). Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Few bursts present. \"One, two! One, two!\" is a rhythmic count but not an onomatopoeic burst like \"snicker-snack\". No clear onomatopoeic bursts like buzz/hiss/pop elsewhere either.

Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: The poem uses canonical tokens like \"Beware\", \"And\", \"One, two! One, two!\", \"Huzzah!\" (fairly original), but doesn't overuse canonical content. Likely ≤8 canonical tokens. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines mostly 8-9 syllables, shorter lines 5-7 syllables (e.g., \"Its teeth of brittleice,\" 6 syll, vs first line \"In winter's grip, the verglas creeps,\" 8 syll).

Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is an implied motif of nature’s harshness and courage in a wintry, mythical landscape, with a layering of mythic struggle and triumph, suggesting a coherent undertone.
