Each stanza’s line count: 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4. All stanzas are quatrains and total stanza count = 10, which exceeds the allowed max of 8, so no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter: lines should alternate longer/shorter with ≥2 content-word difference in ≥60% stanzas. The poem tries some alternation: e.g., lines like “Twas polybrillig...” (~8-9 syllables) followed by shorter lines with ~5-7 syllables. But scanning a few stanzas, alternation is not consistent in 60%+ stanzas; many lines are closer in length. Given borderline and not clearly above 60%, answer no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme: check if lines 2 and 4 rhyme slant or exact in ≥60% stanzas, avoiding AABB dominance. Most stanzas show rhyme or slant rhyme in lines 2 and 4: e.g. stanza1 \"graphs\" / \"halves\", stanza2 \"friend\" / \"glee\", stanza3 \"staid\" / \"glee\"(slant rhyme weak), stanza4 \"show\" / \"row\", stanza5 \"hoops\" / \"chime\"(less obvious rhyme), stanza6 \"thorns\" / \"on\", stanza7 \"sing\" / \"wing\", stanza8 \"brood\" / \"elude\", stanza9 \"converge\" / \"emerge\", stanza10 \"seam\" / \"dream\" all rhyme pairs. Rhyme appears in more than 60% stanzas (actually all or nearly all). AABB rhyme pattern is avoided (mostly ABAB or ABCB). Answer yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: final stanza echoes opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words or clear refrain. The ending stanza (10th) does not reuse distinctive content-words or phrases from the first stanza. The first stanza has coinages \"polybrillig\", \"slithy\", \"graphs\", \"wabe\" etc., last stanza mostly new words: \"polynomial\", \"seam\", \"question\", \"querulous dream\". No clear refrain or repeated phrase. No.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition: stanza 2 says “Beware the Nondet-Bew, my friend!”, clearly an admonition to the protagonist, so yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: stanza 3 mentions protagonist taking \"polish'd polynomial blade, A determin-saber\" and pondering by \"Turing-tree\", counting steps. This is a clear preparation, so yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: stanza 4 shows \"And as the Nondet-Bew leapt forth to show,\" a clear meeting between hero and adversary, so yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: stanza 5 describes \"One-two! One-two! ... deterministic cutter loops; It checks each certificate ...\", a decisive act resolving tension, so yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: stanza 7 and 8 contain joyful exclamations: \"O frabjous P! the watchdogs sing, Callooh! The certifly takes wing!\" but no explicit 'return home' though the tone is celebratory. No direct returning journey or homecoming is described, so no.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count ≥8: New coined words include \"polybrillig\", \"algorims\", \"frumious-sned\", \"veriflow\", \"Nondet-Bew\", \"NP-wend\", \"determin-saber\", \"Turing-tree\", \"verifi-gift\", \"reducethorns\", \"certifly\", \"nondet-mazes\". At least 12 distinct coinages. So yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza has at least one coined/neologistic word, e.g., stanza 1: polybrillig, algorims, frumious-sned, veriflow; stanza 2: Nondet-Bew, NP-wend; stanza 3: polish'd polynomial ( borderline ), determin-saber, Turing-tree; stanza 4: Nondet-Bew; stanza 5: deterministic, certifi-gift; stanza 6: reducethorns, NP-complete; stanza 7: frabjous, certifly; stanza 8: Nondet-Bew's; stanza 9: nondet-mazes; stanza 10: polynomial. So all stanzas have ≥1 coinage, yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: central creature named is \"Nondet-Bew\", clearly a non-canonical, central creature analogue to Jabberwock. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: to count ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts. Poem uses \"One-two! One-two!\", \"loops\", \"checks\" - these are not really onomatopoeic bursts like “snicker-snack” or “Pop!”. No clear onomatopoeia like hiss, snicker-snack, burble. So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Lines like “polish’d polynomial blade,” “determin-saber,” “verifi-gift in polynomial time,” “veriflow hummed,” “million maybes,” “polybade traced,” show consonance and some alliteration. At least 2 stanzas have clear within-line alliteration/consonance beyond incidental. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza 2), preparation (3), encounter (4), decisive action (5), return/celebration (7–8 partial), arc order mostly clear and canonical, though return is less distinct, but order is basically respected. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: No lines exactly matching the canonical 'Jabberwocky' poem; all lines are new. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget ≤8: Canonical tokens used are \"slithy,\" \"wabe,\" \"frumious\" (used in frumious-sned), \"vorpal\" absent, \"manxome\" absent, \"Tumtum\" replaced with \"Turing-tree,\" \"snicker-snack\" no, \"beamish\" no, \"mimsy\" no, \"borogoves\" no - overall only \"slithy,\" \"wabe,\" \"frumious\" (partial) appear. So ≤8 canonical tokens used, yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Check longer lines ≈8–9 syllables, shorter lines ≈5–7 syllables. Sample: stanza1 lines length as \"Twas polybrillig, and the slithy graphs\" (9 syll), \"Did wabe and warp through bitty halves;\" (8), \"All algorims were frumious-sned,\" (7), \"And veriflow hummed in ledgered thread.\" (8). The alternation is not fully consistent, but line lengths cluster near Jabberwocky standard. Majority appear in target range. Given borderline but mostly compliant, answer yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) end-rhymes across stanzas are varied: \"halves\", \"glee\", \"staid\" (slant), \"row\", \"chime\"(weak), \"thorns\"/\"on\", \"sing\"/\"wing\", \"brood\"/\"elude\", \"converge\"/\"emerge\", \"seam\"/\"dream\". No end word reused more than twice (excluding refrains which aren't present). So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is repeated excessively. Protagonist words (\"Nondet-Bew\") used multiple times but well under threshold. No overuse detected. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages include roots: poly-brillig, algorims, frumious-sned, veriflow, Nondet-Bew, determin-saber, Turing-tree, verifi-gift, reducethorns, certifly, nondet-mazes (≥4 distinct roots with suffix/compounding). So yes.</C22_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>", "judge_error": "worker_error: process_row() takes from 7 to 8 positional arguments but 9 were given"}
