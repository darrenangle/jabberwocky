So fails overall.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Looking for alternating longer/shorter line pattern with ≥2 content word difference in ≥60% of stanzas. The stanza lines seem fairly uniform in length; no clear alternating longer/shorter pattern in majority of stanzas—likely no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme pattern: (2,4) rhyme is expected in ≥60% stanzas and not AABB dominated. Stanza 1 (wabe/tune) no rhyme; stanza 2 (begged/pegged) rhyme; stanza 3 (bright/bid) slant rhyme? \"bright\"/\"bid\" do not rhyme; stanza 4 (thread/thread/light) rhymes (2/4: thread/light not exact rhyme but slant rhymes? \"thread\" and \"light\" not really rhyme). Only stanza 2 clearly rhymes 2,4. So <60%; therefore no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition means final stanza echoes the opening with ≥2 repeated content words or a refrain. Opening stanza has 'slithy graphs', 'gyre', 'gimble', 'wabe', this stanza mentions 'maps', 'lamp', 'thread', 'shortest light' but no clear repetition of words like \"wabe,\" \"slithy\" or \"gyre\" or \"mimsy\". Only \"thread\" appears in both stanzas (1st line stanza4 & 3rd line stanza4). Not enough repeated content words or refrain to pass.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition/warning is expected. Stanza 2 has \"Start turned to us and softly begged: 'Be lean, be swift, show me the line;'\". This can be read as a caution or urging, but it is not a typical warning/admonition to protagonist about danger or foe. So no.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before encounter is expected (planning, tool, resolve). Stanza 2 includes \"From S to G the beaded paths were pegged\" and mentions Dijkstra and A-star in stanza 3 (algorithms preparing paths). This can be interpreted as preparation/planning.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter/confrontation expected. This poem has no clear adversary or obstacle; it is about shortest path computation, more abstract. No true encounter scene presented.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action that resolves central tension (like slaying) is expected. Here, no slaying or decisive battle; conclusion states \"Behold the path!\"—a resolution of finding something, more mental than direct action. Probably borderline, but no decisive \"action\" described, so no.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration expected. Last stanza has \"Behold the path!\" and \"all the maps… Whisper: this be the shortest light.\" Possible mild celebratory tone, but no clear jubilant homecoming or congratulation—more subtle. Likely no.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>At least 8 distinct invented coinages required. Here, words like \"frabjous\", \"slithy\", \"gyre\", \"gimble\", \"wabe\" are canonical. Invented terms include \"nodal-burrows\", \"beaded paths\", \"Dijkstra-dreams\", \"A-star-lamps\", \"beaming\", \"beeline\", \"shortest bid\", \"chart of night\" (some coined?). However many are compound or known phrases or standard English. \"Nodal-burrows\" and \"beaded paths\", \"Dijkstra-dreams\", \"A-star-lamps\" pretty clearly coined compound terms. Possibly around 5-6 coinages maximum, under 8 required. So no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza to contain at least 1 coinage. Assuming \"frabjous\" (1), \"nodal-burrows\" (1), \"beaded paths\" (2), \"Dijkstra-dreams\" (3), \"A-star-lamps\" (4), \"beaming\" maybe borderline standard English. Probably each stanza contains ≥1 coined word but borderline on stanza 1 (\"frabjous\", \"slithy\" canonical, \"nodal-burrows\" invented). Stanzas 2 and 3 definitely have coinages. Last stanza less so - \"thread\", \"chart of night\" are borderline as phrases rather than coinage. Conservative judgment: no, since stanza 4 coinages questionable.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central to action (not 'Jabberwock'). No creature or named entity other than abstract concept \"Start\" (personified), Dijkstra, A-star, \"beaded paths\". No creature-like entity is named; so no.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Two or more onomatopoeic bursts e.g., \"snicker-snack\", \"Pop!\". None present. No onomatopoeia detected.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas beyond incidental repeats. Some alliteration in \"beaming a beeline\", \"beaming bright\", \"beaded paths\", \"joined... just...\", but counting stanzas: Stanza 3 has \"Dijkstra-dreams and A-star-lamps burst bright, Beaming a beeline...\". Stanza 4, \"Behold the path! A slender thread,\" doesn't have strong alliteration; stanza 1 has \"frabjous\" and \"slithy\" and \"graphs\", \"gyre and gimble\", some consonance; stanza 2 less so. So at least 2 stanzas with clear alliteration/consonance: yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration. Here, warning absent, so sequence broken; encounter and decisive act absent; preparation present; return weak or absent. So arc sequence fails.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines. All lines distinct from original poem's lines; no exact matches found. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens ≤8. Poem uses \"frabjous\", \"slithy\", \"gyre\", \"gimble\", \"wabe\" all canonical. No other canonical terms like \"mimsy\" or \"borogoves\". Canonical tokens about 5 distinct words. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable-tightness: Longer lines ~8-9 syllables; shorter ~5-7 syllables; alternating lines in each stanza. Sample first stanza: Lines have (approx) 6/7/7/7 syllables--no clear alternating pattern or longer lines reaching 8-9 syllables; likely no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety for (2,4) position: Only stanza 2 has clear rhyme (begged/pegged). Others fail or are no rhyme. Rhyme variety very low. No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overly repeated. The poem's content words are mostly unique; no excessive repetition. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: At least 4 distinct roots required; coinages like \"nodal-burrows\", \"beaded paths\", \"Dijkstra-dreams\", \"A-star-lamps\" provide different roots; if counted as coined terms, varieties exist. Possibly yes.</C22_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>no</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>", "judge_error": "worker_error: process_row() takes from 7 to 8 positional arguments but 9 were given"}

Outcome: no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Final stanza echoes the first with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases or clear refrain? The first stanza: “hollow grind”, “slithy blades”, “gyre and gimble”, “wabe”, “mimsy”, “borogoves”, “mome raths outgrabe”. Final stanza has \"Callooh! Callay!\" and mentions \"frabjous\", \"gleam\", and \"hollow inside\" but no multiple exact repeated content words or clear refrain echoing opening lines. \"Hollow\" appears but only once and not strongly echoed. So no clear ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning admonition: Stanza 2 starts with \"Beware the Hollow Grind\", clearly a caution to the protagonist. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: Stanza 4 mentions whetstone and grit working carefully, preparation of the blade. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: No explicit encounter with an adversary or obstacle. The \"Hollow Grind\" seems more like an abstract concept or tool/process, no meeting with a foe. No.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: No decisive action slaying an adversary; thus, no.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Last stanza has celebratory tone \"Callooh! Callay!\", \"frabjous gleam\", edge growing keen, which is like a celebration or acknowledgment of success. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: No strong coinages invented beyond canonical words \"slithy,\" \"borogoves,\" \"mome,\" \"raths,\" \"outgrabe,\" \"frabjous,\" \"Callooh! Callay!\" (canonical). \"Hollow grind\" is a phrase, not a coinage. No clear new coinages ≥8. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Since few or no coinages, not every stanza contains one. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: No named non-canonical creature apart from canonical words (borogoves, raths) which are canonical. No new creature named. No.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: No onomatopoeic bursts like snicker-snack, Pop!, Hiss! Present? No. No onomatopoeia. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Some mild alliteration (e.g., \"whetstone croons\", \"grind is hollow\"), but no clear strong alliteration in ≥2 stanzas. Probably no.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The poem has warning (stanza 2), then preparation (stanza 4), then celebration (last stanza). No clear encounter or slaying. Arc beats missing steps or out of order. No.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: Several lines are close to canonical poem, e.g. first stanza almost verbatim (with \"slithy blades\" vs \"slithy toves\" and \"gyre and gimble in the wabe; / All mimsy were the borogoves, / And the mome raths outgrabe.\") First stanza mostly canonical with minor word substitutions. This is verbatim or near-verbatim line usage. So no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: >8 distinct canonical tokens are present: slithy, borogoves, mome, raths, outgrabe, frabjous, Callooh, Callay, gyre, gimble, wabe, mimsy. Many canonical tokens reused or preserved. So >8 tokens. No.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: lines roughly approximate 8–9 or 5–7 syllables? Some lines closer but not consistently strict like Jabberwocky. Mixed syllable counts with some longer lines >9 or shorter <5 in places. Probably no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Since rhymes occur only in a few stanzas and few repeated end rhymes (wabe/outgrabe, din/in), and others not rhymed, rhymes are varied and not repeated excessively. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word overused >5 times or >8% content words (only repeated canonical words repeated for style). Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Low coinage count overall, diversity moot or no. No.</C22_think>\n</think>\n\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>", "judge_error": "worker_error: process_row() takes from 7 to 8 positional arguments but 9 were given"}

Less than 8 distinct coinages. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Not all stanzas contain novel coinages; some stanzas have no invented coinages (1st stanza has Jabberlock, snicker-snatchers; 2nd stanza portmanteau is borderline canonical). Last stanzas have no clear coinage. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: Jabberlock is a named non-canonical creature/entity (neologism based on Jabberwock) and central to the warning but not to the action as no confrontation or narrative action around it occurs. Creature/entity named, yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"snicker-snatchers\" is a coined compound based on \"snicker-snack\" but more a name than onomatopoeic burst; \"clink and whispered\", \"clink-and-clack\" partially onomatopoeic.

Lines like \"’Twas brillig, and the keyring did gyre and gimble in the wocky hall;\" are ~13-14 syllables (too long), shorter lines also off meter. No consistent tight syllable pattern matching Jabberwocky’s ~8/6 pattern.

So <60% not met.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (2,4): stanzas mostly rhyme or slant rhyme at lines 2 and 4? Mostly yes; no AABB dominance observed (mostly ABCB or similar). At least 3/5 stanzas rhyme (2,4). Passes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words or refrain? The first and last stanzas share \"wabe\", \"mimsy\", \"borogoves\", \"outgrabe\" in opening stanza but final stanza does not repeat those; final stanza mentions \"jabber-words\" (a new coinage) and winter imagery but no ring echo of first stanza's key words. So no clear ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition/caution exists: stanza 2 begins \"Beware the Fallerook\", fulfilling warning criterion.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: no clear description of protagonist preparing (no tool or resolve mentioned before meeting); poem does not show protagonist preparing or waiting.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: stanza 3 describes a leaf's movement but no direct meeting between protagonist and adversary; \"Fallerook\" is named but no direct encounter scene, no battle or spark.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive act: no decisive action resolving tension; no slaying or triumph depicted.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: final stanza is more reflective and wistful, no jubilant or triumphant return or celebration.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: coinages include \"slithy-leafish\", \"Fallerook\", \"bramble-song\", \"windish\", \"zig and zag\", \"twindle-twirl\", \"jabber-words\", \"rustle-tune\", \"lilting lag\" (to some extent). Counting distinct invented coinages: likely around 8 or slightly fewer, borderline but less than 8 unique fully coined tokens (some are stock or established). Likely no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: not every stanza contains a coinage; first uses \"slithy-leafish\" and \"rustle-breeze\", second has \"Fallerook\", \"bramble-song\", \"windish\", third less clear but has \"zig and zag\" (possibly not a coinage), fourth \"twindle-twirl\" and \"rustle-tune\", fifth has \"jabber-words\". So each stanza has at least one coinage. Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: \"Fallerook\" is a named non-canonical creature central to the poem's caution, so yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: No clear onomatopoeic bursts like \"snicker-snack\". Words like \"rustle\" are standard English and not bursting sounds. No clear onomatopoeia present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance strong in at least two stanzas? Examples: \"twiggle-twirl\", \"bramble-song and windish grin\", \"twilight\" not present; some mild alliteration but not very strong or multiple stanzas with clear alliteration. Probably no.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order warning→preparation→encounter→decisive act→return present? Warning present, but no preparation, no encounter, no decisive action, no return celebration. Arc order No.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines appear; poem uses different words than canonical lines; no line copied exactly. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token count ≤ 8? Poem uses \"wabe\", \"borogoves\", \"mimsy\", \"outgrabe\" from canonical poem; also \"slithy\" variant \"slithy-leafish\" but that counts as new coinage. About 4 canonical tokens present, so ≤8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Line syllable pattern: longer lines ≈8-9 syllables; shorter lines ≈5-7 syllables per stanza? Sampling suggests lines range from 5 to 10; roughly consistent but some lines shorter or longer; not tightly controlled for every stanza; borderline no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: different rhymes used at 2 and 4 lines; no repeating exact rhyme words more than twice; variety adequate in this small poem. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: no single content word overused excessively; words repeated mostly canonical or coinages with moderate frequency. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages like \"slithy-leafish\", \"Fallerook\", \"bramble-song\", \"windish\", \"twindle-twirl\", \"jabber-words\", \"rustle-tune\" show ≥4 distinct roots; no single suffix dominates.

Stanzas are not all quatrains; some are shorter or longer lines. Moreover, first stanza has 2 lines, second has 2, third 2 lines, then 2 lines, 2 lines, 2 lines, 2 lines, 2 lines, 2 lines, 2 lines — actually 10 stanzas but most are couplets or mixed. Not all stanzas have 4 lines, and stanza count exceeds 8. So no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter alternating longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content-word difference in ≥60% stanzas. With many stanzas only two lines each, alternating length pattern is absent. The meter more prose-like and no clear alternating long/short pattern. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme in ≥60% stanzas, lines (2,4) rhyme, avoiding AABB. Since most stanzas are of 2 lines, rhyme of (2,4) lines is not applicable. Some rhyme is present (e.g. \"wabe/outgrabe\", “ticks/sicks”), but no clear stanza rhyme scheme matching (2,4) rhyme in quatrains is found. So no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: final stanza echoing opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words or refrain. The first stanza has “brillig”, “gyre”, “gimble”, “wabe”, “mimsy”, “mome”, “raths”, “outgrabe” used canonical coinages. The last stanza mentions \"O frabjous day\" (canonical) and similar celebratory tone but no direct echo or repeated content words from the first stanza. The first two lines do not reappear. So no clear ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition is present in stanza 2: \"Beware the greedy queue, with snicker-snack of ticks;\" - a warning to the protagonist. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before encounter: After the warning, the poem describes taking action \"From source S we seek the target T,\" and \"pluck neighbors\" — suggesting preparation and active planning before the confrontation. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: The poem centers on the pursuit of the shortest path, processing nodes, \"relax the edges\", but no personified adversary or creature is engaged. The \"greedy queue\" is treated like a threat, but no explicit adversary encounter or battle. So no clear confrontation meeting.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying or decisive action resolving tension: There's \"the shortest path has found its way to light,\" resolving the search problem. While more abstract than a battle, a decisive resolution to the quest is achieved. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return or celebration: The last stanza has \"O frabjous day!\" and celebrates success finding the path. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: Check coinages distinct from canonical. The poem contains “greedy queue”, “ticks”, “sicks”, “skein”, “heap of glimmering care”, “fruitless dare”, “prefix”, “relax” (standard word), “thread”, “ribbon” (standard), “glimmering” (standard adjective). Only few heavily invented or nonce coinages: “snicker-snack” (canonical), “skein” is English, “sicks” is English plural adjective, “glimmering care” more poetic. So no 8+ distinct invented coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Since there are few coinages, and many stanzas lack invented words (mostly regular English words), stanzas do not all contain coinages. So no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: No non-canonical creature/entity is named and central to action. \"Greedy queue\" is metaphorical, not a creature. No.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Only \"snicker-snack\" in stanza 2 is canonical onomatopoeia. No additional onomatopoeic bursts like “Pop!”, “Hiss!”, or multiple onomatopoeias total ≥2. So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas: Some mild consonance possibly \"pluck,\" \"paths,\" \"prefix,\" but no strong/alliterative clusters like original poem. No clear demonstrable strong alliteration in two stanzas. So no.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning in stanza 2, preparation from stanza 3 and 4, no clear confrontation, decisive action in stanza 9, celebration stanza 10. The encounter/confrontation beat missing. So arc order is incomplete, no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim canonical lines: The poem uses the canonical first stanza exactly? No, the first stanza uses canonical words but is not a verbatim copy (differs line 1 ends with ';' not line break, line 2 different). No identical lines from canonical poem. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Uses many canonical words like “brillig”, “gyre”, “gimble”, “wabe”, “mimsy”, “mome”, “raths”, “outgrabe”, and “snicker-snack”, “O frabjous day”, “beamish boy” etc. Canonical tokens ≤8 is met (exact count around 8 or less). So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Original poem lines mostly 8-9 syllables (long lines) and 5-7 (short lines). Here, lines vary and many couplets do not show alternating long/short and several lines exceed 9 syllables or fewer than 5 strongly. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhyme (2,4) is ambiguous since most stanzas are 2 lines. Rhymes \"wabe/outgrabe\", \"ticks/sicks\", \"light/night\", \"care/dare\", \"sun/won\", \"time/prime\", \"light/sight\" appear varied with little repetition of end words. No end-word reused >2 times, so yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No word outside canonical or coinages appears overused disproportionately. Lexical diversity seems acceptable. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Few coinages overall, mainly standard English with metaphorical use, no coinages with distinct roots ≥4.

However, it is not shown or confronted, but it is named and central to the poem's tension.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: The poem contains no clear onomatopoeic bursts like \"snicker-snack,\" \"Pop!,\" or \"Hiss!\". \"Trumpet-mark\" and \"steam goes sighing\" imply sound but are not clear onomatopoeic bursts or words representing sound effects.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Examples such as \"proofing spell,\" \"bread-born,\" \"bannetons did gyre and gimble,\" \"burst,\" \"bellow,\" \"bread-born dawn braided\" indicate some alliteration and consonance. At least 2 stanzas (1, 4) show such devices clearly.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The poem moves from warning (\"Beware the Yeastwock\") → preparation (clutching basket) → dough waking (implied rising) → finishing with proofing; however, lacks encounter and decisive action before return/celebration (which is weak). Thus, arc beat order is incomplete or partial, not full canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim lines: No lines are verbatim from the canonical poem 'Jabberwocky.' Many words altered or new coinages used.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens: Words like 'brillig,' 'gyre,' 'gimble,' 'wabe,' 'mimsy,' 'mome,' 'outgrabe' appear, fewer than 8 distinct canonical tokens reused. Counted canonical tokens ≤8, so yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: The first stanza has a very long first line (more than 9 syllables), and syllable counts appear irregular overall. The ballad meter and precise syllable counts (~8/6) are not maintained consistently in quatrains, especially given the irregular first stanza. So fails syllable tightness criterion.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhymes in stanzas 2, 3, 4 are varied (\"sighs\"/\"skies,\" \"sing\"/\"spring,\" \"gleam\"/\"dream\"). No repeated end word more than twice. So rhyme variety criterion passed.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No content word obviously overused beyond 5 times or 8%. Lexical items like \"dough,\" \"basket\" are repeated but not excessively. So guard passed.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages are novel but mostly derived from baking/food roots: \"bannetons,\" \"doughlings,\" \"crumb-wisp,\" \"Yeastwock,\" “floury wabe.” Roots centered mostly on bread/dough/yeast, so coinage variety is limited, likely fewer than 4 distinct roots.</C22_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>", "judge_error": "worker_error: process_row() takes from 7 to 8 positional arguments but 9 were given"}

Yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza does not echo the opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words or refrain. The last stanza is new text, no reuse of \"brillig,\" \"slithy,\" \"toves,\" \"gyre,\" \"gimble,\" \"wabe,\" \"mimsy,\" \"borogoves,\" \"mome,\" or \"raths,\" nor refrains from first stanza.

Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: The poem lacks a vivid direct meeting between protagonist and adversary; the main conflict is more abstract and implied. The opponent or obstacle is the “Snap!” and Bandersnatch, but no direct confrontation stanza or description of meeting apart from \"One twist, one snap...\". No clear meeting described.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: The decisive action is hinted in stanza 3: “One twist, one snap, and lo, the loop unspanned,” a decisive act resolving tension.

Callay!” (canonical), “sang in looping tune,” “sun-lit.”  \nCounting distinct coinages:  \n- rubberbands (compound but arguably English; likely borderline)  \n- elastic looms (elastic is English, looms English)  \n- braided knave (braided English, knave English)  \n- Snap! (possibly coined creature/term)  \n- wabe-bard (coinage)  \n- spindler-wand (coinage)  \n- rubber-hedge (coinage)  \n- loop unspanned (unspanned possibly coined)  \nAt minimum around 4 definite coinages (\"wabe-bard,\" \"spindler-wand,\" \"rubber-hedge,\" \"Snap!\"). \"unspanned\" likely coined. However, needing ≥8 distinct coinages is not met.

Not all stanzas contain a coinage. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: A non-canonical creature or entity named and central is required (not 'Jabberwock'). \"Snap!\" seems like a coined adversary name; also \"Bandersnatch\" mentioned but canonical. \"Snap!\" seems to be central to the threat. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Require ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts.

No.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order (warning, prep, encounter, decisive act, return/celebration):  \nWarning in stanza 2; prep in stanza 3; decisive act also in stanza 3 (twist/snap); no clear encounter stanza; celebration in stanza 4; order is mostly correct but missing clear encounter beat.

This is borderline but rules say no exact match. These are adapted lines, not exact. Overall no exact verbatim line found.

No.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness in quatrain stanzas with longer lines ~8-9 syll and shorter lines ~5-7 syll:  \nExamples:  \n1st stanza lines are mostly between 7 and 9 syllables; no clear alternate short line.  \nSome lines are 8-9 syll (longer), some 7 (shorter). But alternating pattern not clear.  \nOverall, syllable pattern loosely matches but not consistently per stanza. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety on (2,4) lines: 5 stanzas, each stanza rhymes lines 2 and 4. End rhymes vary: wabe/knave, sleeve/heave, go/show, tune/gloom. No significant reuse of end words more than twice. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word seems overused. \"rubber\" used twice with compounds, \"bandersnatch\" twice but canonical. No problematic overuse. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages present include \"rubberbands,\" \"braided knave,\" \"Snap!,\" \"wabe-bard,\" \"spindler-wand,\" \"rubber-hedge,\" \"loop unspanned.\" Multiple different roots—at least 4 distinct roots.

Line counts per stanza vary and no stanza consistently has exactly 4 lines; e.g. first stanza has 4 lines, second stanza has 4 lines, third stanza 4 lines, fourth stanza 2 lines, fifth stanza 2 lines, sixth stanza 4 lines. So not all stanzas are quatrains, and stanza count (6) is within 5-8, but since not all stanzas have 4 lines, no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter requires lines alternating longer/shorter with ≥2 content words difference in ≥60% stanzas. Lines vary in length and style, but many lines are irregular in syllable/content word count. Only the first 3 stanzas might approach this pattern; last stanzas are shorter or irregular. Strictness requires ≥60% stanzas, so 4 out of 6 or more; not clearly met -> no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme (2,4) rhyming in ≥60% stanzas, plus avoiding AABB dominance. The rhyme is very loose or mostly absent; obvious rhymes like “wabe/outgrabe” in stanza 1, close rhyme “prune/noon” stanza 1, but many stanzas do not rhyme (e.g. stanza 2: sly/sky not perfect rhyme but slant rhyme; stanza 3 has “glean/seen” rhyme (2,4 lines). Later stanzas 4 and 5 are 2-line stanzas, no obvious rhyme pairs. So possibly 3-4 stanzas rhyme (just over half), but AABB structure not dominant (the first stanza is ABCB). Slant rhymes present. Since several stanzas do rhyme on lines 2 and 4, and no heavy AABB, borderline but leaning yes. However stanza count is 6 with two stanzas 2 lines only, so not all quatrains. Formal pattern doesn’t fully hold, so conservatively no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition checking final stanza echoing first stanza with ≥2 repeated content words or clear refrain. The final stanza has: “data,” “spectral,” “lattice,” “clustering,” “order;” first stanza has “spectral,” “slithy graphs,” “gyre,” “wabe,” “mimsy,” “borogoves,” “outgrabe.” Only “spectral” and concept of “data” and “lattice” appear multiple times. However, fewer repeated content words than original’s echo (which repeats exact lines nearly verbatim). There is no refrain or clear strong echo in final stanza. Words differ substantially. Hence no ring echo.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Is there an early admonition or warning? Stanza 1 line 3-4: “Beware the Clusterywock, my son! The eigenwaves bite, the eigenvalues prune; One misstep in L = D - W, and data-thistled shadows bloom at noon.” This is an explicit warning or admonition -> yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before encounter: stanza 2 describes protagonist taking “W,” “the Laplacian L,” “smallest eigenvectors,” stacking matrix Y etc. This counts as preparation of tools and resolve before encounter -> yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: not a clear physical meeting with an adversary, but stanza 1 introduces adversary Clusterywock, stanza 4 and 5 speak of spectral gap, lingering haze, separation, which are abstractly the encounter and tension. Not a direct meeting but abstract metaphorical encounter is present. However, the sequence is allegorical, not literal meeting. The criterion is “clear meeting,” which is borderline. Due to ambiguity and partial abstraction, conservatively no.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying or decisive action resolving central tension: stanza 3 and 4 describe extracting eigenvectors and K-means clustering resulting in crisp clusters (“O frabjous day!”), so a decisive computational resolution acts like slaying. Arguably \"O frabjous day!\" echoes the original celebratory tone but here is part of resolution, thus decisive action is present -> yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: stanza 3 ends with “O frabjous day! ... quiet and clean,” celebrating clustering; stanza 6 also expresses order arising. However, no literal return/homecoming or jubilant acknowledgement as person returning from battle. The celebration is abstract, but clearly jubilant acknowledgement of success in clustering. Partial metaphor for return implied, but no literal return. Strictness requires literal sense, so no.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: invented words or coinages unrelated to canonical ones are “Spectral,” “Clusterywock,” “eigenwaves,” “eigenvalues,” “data-thistled,” “lattice-lamp,” “glassy,” “Y” (used technically here as variable name), “spectral veil,” “lattice-blooming,” “clusters,” “kin and kin,” “sighs” used metaphorically. But “eigen-” related words are standard math terms, not clearly invented coinages. Clusterywock is new coinage. “Data-thistled” is coined. “Lattice-lamp,” “lattice-blooming” are novel compounds. Counting distinct coinages difficult but fewer than 8 distinct totally novel invented words (some math terms standard English or math jargon). So less than 8 distinct new coinages -> no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: not all stanzas contain a coinage. First stanza has “Clusterywock,” “data-thistled.” Second stanza has “Laplacian,” “lattice-lamp.” Third stanza has “Y,” “spectral veil.” Fourth stanza has “spectrum” (normal math term), “narrow gap” (normal phrase). Fifth stanza has “eigenvalues.” Sixth stanza has “lattice-blooming.” Some are compounds rather than strict coinages. So at least one coinage per stanza mostly, except stanza 5 might reuse known math terms (eigenvalues). Given borderline, partial fulfillment but cautious no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: “The Clusterywock” is named and is adversary. Not canonical (not the Jabberwock). So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: no clear onomatopoeic bursts like “snicker-snack” or “Pop!” No bursts of sounds imitating noises -> no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repetition: some stanzas show consonance (e.g. “spectral, slithy… graphs did gyre and gimble” has some repeats), “lattice-lamp that glows in glassy sky” has alliteration of l’s and g’s, “lattice-blooming din” has alliteration, but clear within-line alliteration occurs in only 1-2 stanzas max. Need ≥2 stanzas with clear alliteration beyond incidental. Only 1-2 stanzas have clear such devices, so no.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning first stanza, preparation second stanza, encounter late stanza 1 and 4, decisive act stanza 3, celebration stanza 3-6. Slightly out of canonical order since stanza 3 (action) precedes stanza 4 (warning again). Strict canonical order requires warning→preparation→encounter→slaying→return; here stanza 4 returns to warning about spectrum and haze after celebration stanza. So arc order is not fully canonical → no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines. The poem modifies original lines heavily, uses some canonical words but lines rewritten completely, so no verbatim lines -> yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens count: “slithy,” “gyre,” “gimble,” “wabe,” “mimsy,” “borogoves,” “outgrabe,” “beamish” (no beamish used here), “frabjous,” “callooh,” “callay” absent except “O frabjous day!” in stanza 3. So canonical tokens about 7-8 max. Acceptable canonical budget -> yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness in quatrains: since not all stanzas quatrains, and lines have varying syllable counts (long initial stanza lines are quite long; shorter stanzas have 2 lines; syllables per line vary 6-14). The pattern’s not tight 8–9 / 5–7 syllables. So no syllable tightness -> no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: rhymes limited; few repeated rhyme endings; some (wabe/outgrabe), prune/noon, glean/seen. No exact end word reused >2 times excluding ring echo (which is not present). So rhyme variety acceptable -> yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no single content word is heavily overused; text is diverse, no >5 or >8% repetition. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages few, some compound coinages; “Clusterywock” root, “data-thistled,” “lattice-lamp,” “lattice-blooming,” “spectral veil.” Possibly about 3-4 distinct roots in coinages. Borderline for 4 distinct roots, leaning no since many coinages share \"lattice-\" prefix; “eigen-” counted as math term not coinage. So no.</C22_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>", "judge_error": "worker_error: process_row() takes from 7 to 8 positional arguments but 9 were given"}
