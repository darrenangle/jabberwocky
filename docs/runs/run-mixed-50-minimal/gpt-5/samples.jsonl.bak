The instructions ask if poem matches the style of Jabberwocky, no explicit topic required. No separate topic given. By default adherence is to Jabberwocky theme or established narrative?

Rhyme variety not really applicable as minimal rhyme is present; no reuse of exact rhyme end word >2 times.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guarded: No evident content word overused excessively: \"the,\" \"and,\" standard function words aside, no single content word appears disproportionally.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages show multiple distinct roots, e.g., \"joltjawed,\" \"Voltivore,\" \"turnstilebrand,\" \"tremorwhirring,\" \"neon-nickel,\" \"pocket-while,\" \"clattersnap,\" \"gloamsong,\" \"signal-lanterns.\" No single suffix dominates >50%.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly addresses a dark industrial or railway-themed monster narrative; seems aligned with the original thematic battle against a creature (though changed from Jabberwock to Voltivore). Topic clearly addressed.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is an undertone about vigilance, danger, and order in an industrial or underground setting with subtle motifs of light/dark (copper light), noise (hiss, clatter), and human struggle against an ominous force (Voltivore).

No clear named creature central to action - no.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeic bursts ≥2? No clear onomatopoeic words like \"snicker-snack,\" \"burbled,\" or other bursts stand out. Mostly descriptive words. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance ≥2 stanzas? Yes, multiple examples: \"bristle-bare the fallow,\" \"chaffwind skreeked,\" \"starble-flocks in swindle-skein,\" \"mirk and mither,\" \"whirled and whickered,\" \"snarléd ring,\" etc. More than two stanzas clearly have alliterative lines - yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order of canonical beats (warning→prep→encounter→decisive→return)? Warning present early, preparation present, but no encounter, no decisive action, no return/celebration. So arc incomplete or out of canonical order - no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim canonical lines? None of the canonical lines are repeated verbatim; new text entirely - yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token count ≤8? Very few or no canonical lexicon words appear; none of the canonical coinages or special words like \"brillig,\" \"slithy,\" \"toves,\" \"jabberwock,\" etc., are in poem. Canonical tokens count is zero or very low - yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness (long lines 8-9 syllables, short lines 5-7) in all quatrains? Sample lines: \"Gloamgather fell on shivvered sheaves,\" (8 syll), \"And bristle-bare the fallow lay;\" (7 syll), \"The chaffwind skreeked through thornéd eaves,\" (~8 syll), \"As dusk unspooled its dusky way.\" (7 syll) The pattern roughly matches alternate longer (8-9) and shorter (5-7) lines in all stanzas. Likely yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme pairs are varied across stanzas, no end word reused more than twice; rhyme endings differ stanza to stanza. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word seems overused. Most words are varied and coinages dominate; no word excessively repeated. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Many distinct roots in coined words (\"gloamgather,\" \"shivvered,\" \"chaffwind,\" \"starble,\" \"swindle,\" \"whickered,\" \"brumpled,\" \"skurling,\" \"sable-knot,\" \"scudder,\" \"whisklers,\" \"shamble-staff,\" \"hedgewise,\" \"tintle-shadow,\" \"runnels,\" \"sprindle\") — more than 4 distinct roots, and no suffix dominates - yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem does not address the Jabberwock or its encounter, but deals with a murmuration over stubble, a natural phenomenon, quite different from the source poem’s topic. The topic is not the original; it substitutes a different subject - no.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied layer? There is a mood evoked of nature, twilight, transformation, and maybe a metaphor for change or dissolving order, suggesting a subtle undertone beyond surface description - yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>no</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}
