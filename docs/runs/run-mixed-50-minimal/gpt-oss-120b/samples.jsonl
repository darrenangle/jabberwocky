Yes.</C1_think>\n<C2_think>Stanza count: 4 stanzas total; each stanza has exactly 4 lines (quatrain). However, the total stanza count is 4, which is fewer than the required minimum of 5. So no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter: Checking alternate longer/shorter line length with ≥2 content-word difference in ≥60% of stanzas. Lines in each stanza show some alternation (e.g., first line longer, second shorter), but this is tested on content-word counts or syllables. The pattern is inconsistent and likely not sustained ≥60% (would be only 2 or 3 stanzas of 4). So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme: Rhyme in lines 2 and 4 per stanza is generally present with at least slant rhyme ('whiff'/'rift', 'ark'/'hark', 'thrust'/'dust', 'lay'/'day'). No clear pattern of AABB dominance; mostly ABCB style. At least 3 out of 4 stanzas have clear rhymes (75%). So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Last stanza echoes the first stanza? The last stanza does not repeat specific content words or phrases from the first stanza. No repeated refrain or phrase.

Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: There is a subtle encounter implied between letter/quill and “whisp-wraiths that hark,” but no clear direct confrontation between protagonist and adversary. Slightly ambiguous, but probably no clear meeting. So no.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: No clear decisive act resolving central tension is described. The letter returns bidirectionally, but no combat or slaying is depicted. No.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: The last stanza describes letter fleeing back to cedar chest and will “grin at nonsense—night and day,” but no jubilant return or celebration is evident. No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Distinct coinages: Coinages: snorps, flim-flam, slorped, shnug-bright, vorn-bound, snarved-inked, fangle-grove, whisp-wraiths, rib-tangled, snicker-gloom, quix-leaf, yond-blade, rindle, quill-grim. At least 13 distinct invented coinages. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one invented coinage word (e.g., snorps, flim-flam, shnug-bright, snicker-gloom). So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>A non-canonical creature/entity named and central is the “Quill-grim” mentioned as an adversary (“Beware the Quill-grim’s rift!”). So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: “snicker-gloom” is coined and partially onomatopoeic but no clear onomatopoeic bursts like “snicker‑snack!”, “Pop!”, or “Hiss!” found twice. Only one near case, so no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas: Examples include “snorps/Did crackle”, “flim-flam letters, spurred and slorped,” “snatch the dusky, snarved-inked ark,” “fern-spear and yond-blade’s thrust,” “rib-tangled rhyme.” At least two stanzas show clear alliteration/consonance. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: There is a warning (first stanza), preparation (third stanza), but no clear encounter or decisive slaying and no return celebration in proper order. Arc order incomplete or out of canonical sequence. No.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No canonical poem verbatim lines: None of the original poem’s lines appear exactly. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Very few canonical words appear besides “Did” and “Beware”; main canonical coinages are absent or replaced. Canonical tokens ≤8 (likely 2–3). Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts approximate Jabberwocky’s pattern of longer line ~8–9 syllables, shorter line ~5–7 syllables: Lines tend to be varied and a bit longer in the 2nd line of stanza 1 and 2, but mostly close to expected length ranges. However, with only 4 stanzas and somewhat inconsistent lengths, cannot be sure ≥ all quatrains meet pattern. Borderline, so no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The rhymes in (2,4) lines—‘whiff’/’rift’, ‘ark’/’hark’, ‘thrust’/’dust’, ‘lay’/’day’—show 4 different rhyme pairs, no excessive repetition, and no single rhyme repeated >2 times. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No content word appears overused. No excessive repetition, especially outside potential ring. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety by root: Coinages show a variety of roots—snorps, flim-flam, slorped, shnug, vorn, snarved, fangle, whisp, rib, snicker, quix, yond, rindle, quill, grim. More than 4 distinct roots, no dominant suffix repetition. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem’s topic is a narrative styled like Jabberwocky but focused on a mysterious letter and “Quill-grim” rather than the Jabberwock. This is a creative deviation, but the poem clearly addresses the theme of a nonsense adventure poem mimicking Jabberwocky style, not substituting a different subject. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem implies a motif of mysterious messages, “letters,” and resistance against some cryptic force (Quill-grim), giving a subtle undertone of hidden knowledge, secrecy, and enduring nonsense. A coherent implied layer is detectable. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Common words like \"blued,\" \"night\" appear but ≤5 times or ≤8% given short length; no overuse problem -> yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages use different roots: blued (color), whiffle, snarkling, dare-chanting, gimble, trem-tide, fuzzle-gleam, snarvish, knobbly, yonder curl.\n\nAt least 4 distinct roots; no dominant suffix or root >50% of coinages. -> yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Clear Jabberwocky derivative with a named creature \"Blued Screw.\" Adheres to theme of a terrible creature and heroic confrontation. Topic aligned with prompt. -> yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Implied undertone of struggle and peace within a somewhat alien, surreal landscape; the conflict and aftermath suggest a motif of overcoming chaos returning to calm.

Since no adversary named or battle scene direct, topic presence is questionable. The poem clearly addresses an invented battle with \"glim-shard\" and frozen/granite theme distinct from Jabberwock but echoes similar structure. The task is to check match of style to Jabberwocky poem, not necessarily same titular subject. Topic is ambiguous but likely no due to missing creature/clear adversary. So answer no (poem shifts subject from Jabberwocky style with coinages to an elemental, less narrative poem).</C23_think>\n<C24_think>The poem has at least some coherent implied layer: struggle against frozen forces, nature’s hardness; an undertone of confrontation and release/purification (\"granite breathed alone\").

No obvious dominant AABB pattern.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: last stanza does not echo first stanza’s specific content words or include a clear refrain; no strong repeated phrases or content word repetition between first and last stanza.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition: stanza 3 contains “Beware the honed burr’s keen, keen snarl” — clear early admonition present.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: stanza 4 suggests protagonist grabs “your light” and “fled the forest” indicating some preparation and resolve before confrontation, but confrontation and preparation timings uncertain.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: the Slurry is described and feared but no explicit meeting or confrontation line shown; no direct meeting of protagonist and adversary clearly narrated.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: no explicit decisive action resolving tension; no slaying or conclusive act visible in the poem.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: no return or jubilant homecoming described; no joyful acknowledgment or celebratory ending present.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Distinct coinages: “brillig,” “slith’ring,” “whiffl’d,” “grumbled,” “hon’d burrs,” “sludgy,” “Slurry,” “quix‑clucked,” “whorls,” etc. at least 8 distinct novel or fanciful coinages or nonce words used.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinages spread: each stanza contains at least one coinage or non-canonical word—first stanza “brillig, slith’ring,” second stanza “Slurry, gnarl-girded, quix-clucked,” third stanza “snar,” “whorls,” fourth stanza “waltz-gilded.”</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: “Slurry” is named and central as adversary, non-canonical entity distinct from canonical Jabberwock.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: “Crumple, snap, and fright!” and “grumbled,” and “snarl” could count partially, but explicit onomatopoeic bursts (like “snicker-snack”) fewer than 2 distinct strong bursts.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: several alliterations present such as “swell and glassy-glee”, “honed burrs in slith’ring spree” (alliteration in stanza 1), “gnarl-girded teeth,” “quix-clucked ferns” in stanza 2, “keen, keen snarl,” “sludgy Slurry’s lurching snar,” “forest’s waltz-gilded rain” in stanza 4; more than 2 stanzas clearly show alliteration/consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning (stanza 3), preparation (stanza 4), but no clear encounter stanza or decisive slaying stanza or return/celebration in order; arc incomplete and order ambiguous.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines match canonical poem verbatim; all lines original or altered.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens: “brillig,” “whiffl’d” and “snarl” (less strict) are only canonical or near-canonical words; under 8 distinct canonical tokens used.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines mostly 8–9 syllables, shorter lines ~5–7 syllables, fairly consistent with Jabberwocky pattern in all 4 quatrains.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme varies stanza to stanza, no end word reused more than twice, fits criterion given stanza count.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: no single content word overused greatly; lexical items well spread.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages stem from varied roots (“glassy-glee,” “honed burr,” “Slurry,” “quix-clucked,” “whorls,” “waltz-gilded”); no single root dominates over 50%.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-like nonsensical creature encounter theme with nonsense lexicon, matching topic style.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: without direct narrative clarity or layered metaphor, subtext is minimal or unclear; no evident coherent undertone or motif beyond surface nonsense adventure.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>"}
