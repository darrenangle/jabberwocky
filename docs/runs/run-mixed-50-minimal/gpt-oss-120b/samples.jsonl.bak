Easily ≥8 distinct inventions not canonical or English.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coined word (looking at each stanza: stanza 1 has many, stanza 2 has several, stanza 3 has coinages, stanza 4 repeats sly-slinky but has \"sigh-braid\" as coinage).

Thus canonical tokens ≤8.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Longer lines mostly ~8–9 syllables, shorter lines ~5–7 syllables; pattern roughly holds in stanzas 1-3 but stanza 4 lines are shorter or less clearly matching. Overall mostly within target ranges.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme end words vary; no single rhyme repeated more than twice. Slant rhymes prevent oversimple repetition.
