Clear refrain.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition is present: Second stanza is a clear admonition (\"Beware the Reglet, my child! / The edge that bites, the line that snags! / Beware the Furniture, so wild, / And shun their clattering brags!\").</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: Protagonist takes a \"vorpal blade in hand\" and \"long time ... he sought\", and rested and \"stood awhile in thought\" before encounter; preparation present.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: Clear encounter with Reglet (a named creature) and Furniture (a second adversary) who engage the protagonist.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: The Reglet is slain decisively (\"He slew it dead\"); however, the Furniture remains undefeated, protagonist is trapped; initial decisive act present for first adversary, though no final decisive victory over Furniture.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: No return or celebration stanza or event is present; the protagonist ends trapped and surrounded by Furniture with no triumphant return.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Invented coinages: Words like \"clambering\", \"wobbly\" (not invented), \"borogroves\" (invented variant of borogoves), \"Reglet\", \"Furniture\" (standard word but used as adversary name), \"kerning glare\", \"whirring\", \"metric flair\", \"chortling cry\", \"shelfy sky\" (invented compounds/imagery); distinct novel coinages or modified coinages count at least 8 if counting clear blends/variants (\"Reglet\", \"borogroves\", \"kerning glare\", \"whirring\", \"metric flair\", \"shelfy sky\", \"clambering\", \"wobbly\" is ordinary adjective though). \"Borogroves\" is a variant but count as coinage.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage presence per stanza: Most stanzas have at least one coinage (\"borogroves\", \"Reglet\", \"kerning glare\", \"whirring\", \"snicker-snack\" canonical, \"galumphing\" canonical, \"shelfy\", \"chortling\"); at least 7-8 stanzas contain coinages.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: Reglet (not a canonical creature) is named and central to action; Furniture acts as collective antagonist; Furniture is not canonical creature from Jabberwocky but serves as named adversary. Reglet clearly a non-canonical creature name.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"snicker-snack\" is canonical onomatopoeia; \"hissed\" is an onomatopoeic burst, also \"clattering brags\" implies sound. Only one explicit canonical onomatopoeia \"snicker-snack\" plus \"hissed\" which works but might be borderline for two distinct onomatopoeic bursts. Hesitation here, as \"hissed\" is less burst-like but counts as onomatopoeic. Possibly \"clattering\" also phonetic. Accepting as >=2 onomatopoeic bursts.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Multiple stanzas show clear alliteration, e.g., \"clattering brags\", \"shelfy sky\", \"chortling cry\", \"long time the manxome foe he sought\", used throughout.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning → Preparation → Encounter → Decisive Act → Return/Celebration. The poem presents warning (stanza 2), preparation (3), encounter (4 and 6), decisive act (5; Reglet slain), but no clear return/celebration stanza is present. Arc mostly followed but missing final beat.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines used; some close but all lines reworded or replaced; e.g., \"’Twas clambering dusk\" vs “’Twas brillig” etc.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token budget (distinct canonical words) ≤8: The poem uses canonical words such as \"wabe\", \"borogroves\" (variant of borogoves), \"mome raths outgrabe\", \"vorpal\", \"snicker-snack\", \"galumphing\", \"tulgey\", \"uffish\" (?), \"manxome\" (from reference), \"Tumtum\" (variant as \"tumtum stand\"). However, \"Uffish\" is only in reference, not model poem, so not counted. There are ≤8 distinct canonical tokens reused (\"wabe\", \"borogroves\", \"mome\", \"raths\", \"outgrabe\", \"vorpal\", \"snicker-snack\", \"galumphing\", \"tulgey\", \"manxome\", \"tumtum\"—some variants or close). The poem uses about 9 total close canonical tokens if counting variants as distinct, which is borderline, but the count slightly exceeds 8. \"borogroves\" is a variant of \"borogoves\" but still equivalent canonical root. Since the instructions favor new coinages and canonical tokens should be ≤8 distinct. Counting variants as the same reduces count; the poem leans on canonical tokens about 9 times total, maybe borderline but likely over 8 distinct tokens.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Lines mostly use roughly 8-9 syllables in longer lines and 5-7 in shorter ones in quatrains. Example: First stanza lines — “’Twas clamb’ring dusk,” (4-5), longer lines like “Did gyre and gimble o’er the wabe;” (7-8) and \"All flimsy were the borogroves\" (7-8) — somewhat looser but generally consistent within ±1 syllable; mostly matches Jabberwocky’s ~8/6 pattern, acceptable syllable tightness.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Ending rhymes in (2,4) positions are varied across stanzas (\"wabe/brags\", \"wild/snags\", \"thought/sought\", \"flair/there\", \"snack/back\", \"spite/might\", \"bind/mind\", \"wabe/outgrabe\"); minimal reuse of exact end words more than twice; rhyme variety adequate.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overly repeated; common content words (e.g., “blade”) appear several times but well below 5 times or 8%; lexical repetition is reasonable.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages show several different roots: \"Reglet\", \"borogroves\", \"kerning glare\", \"whirring\", \"chortling\", \"shelfy\", \"clambering\", \"wobbly\" (some ordinary words but used stylistically), so at least 4-5 distinct roots; suffix or root diversity acceptable.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem addresses a Jabberwocky-type story with a similar topic (a strange creature \"Reglet\" and Furniture as antagonists), clearly in the style and theme, no unrelated topic substitution.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is some implied subtext about the protagonist battling confusing or overwhelming obstacles beyond the \"Reglet\" (the Furniture as multiple threats), possibly indicating struggle beyond a singular foe; this deeper layer is plausible though subtle and somewhat ambiguous but detectable across poem.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Total stanza count 8, which is between 5 and 8, so yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>In at least 5 of 8 stanzas, lines alternate longer/shorter with ≥2 content-word difference: some clear alternation in meter and stress, consistent with ballad meter pattern in majority majority of stanzas, so yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>In at least 5 of 8 stanzas, lines 2 and 4 rhyme or have slant rhyme. Rhymes such as \"deck\"/\"wreck\", \"split\"/\"fit\", \"sought\"/\"thought\", \"flared\"/\"glared\", \"snicker-snack\"/\"aback\", \"boy\"/\"Callay\", and repeated stanza endings. The poem avoids AABB dominance because most stanzas rhyme (2,4), not (1,2) or other patterns. So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza repeats the first stanza exactly line for line (except for a few slightly different words like “a-wreck” rather than “a-wreck.” which doesn’t affect), so the ring composition with repeated content words and phrasing is clearly present. Yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition line: “Beware the Four-Strand, my lad!” is a direct caution to protagonist, fulfilling warning/admonition role. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>The protagonist prepares by “took his fid of vorpal gleam” and “Long time the strandly foe he sought— / So rested he by a marlin’s beam / And stood awhile in thought.” This is clearly preparation and armament. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter described as “The Four-Strand mess... / Came whirring through the tugboat wood,” meaning a confrontation happens. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action given in “One, two! One, two! And through and through / The fid of steel went snicker-snack!” showing the decisive slaying/splicing of foe.

Callay! / He chortled in his joy.” This shows the triumphant return/celebration. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Invented coinages count: knotwind, braidy, fraysome, strandly, spliceful, slipknot’s, fid (arguably a real term but specialized), tugboat wood (compound but not coined), “tangled as it glared” (normal), “knotty boy” (play on knot). Counting 8+ clear nonce words coined or meaningfully new (\"knotwind,\" \"braidy,\" \"fraysome,\" \"strandly,\" \"spliceful,\" \"slipknot’s,\" “whirring” is common, “fid” arguably more technical than invented). At least 8 distinct coined forms or nonce coinages clearly present. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains multiple coinages - first stanza has knotwind, braidy, fraysome; second stanza Four-Strand, tangly, slipknot’s; third stanza fid, vorpal, strandly; fourth stanza spliceful, Four-Strand, tugboat; fifth stanza snicker-snack (canonical), fid; sixth stanza tamed, knotty, frabjous, callooh, callay (canonical). So all stanzas have at least 1 coinage, yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>The named creature/entity is \"Four-Strand,\" which is clearly the adversary central to the action (not Jabberwock). So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: “snicker-snack!” (canonical), “whirring” (an onomatopoeic verb for buzzing sound) is present. “Snicker-snack!” is canonical onomatopoeia; one other onomatopoeic burst “whirring” though less bursty. Only one strong exclamatory onomatopoeia. The requirement is ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts (e.g., ‘snicker-snack!’, ‘Pop!’, ‘Hiss!’). “Whirring” is a weaker onomatopoeic verb form, less explosive. No second bursty onomatopoeia like Pop! or Hiss! So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance are present: for example “braidy ropes”, “fraysome were the woven hopes”, “strandly foe he sought,” “spliced it neat,” “knotty boy.” Multiple stanzas contain alliteration beyond incidental repeats. At least two stanzas show this clearly. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza 2), preparation (stanza 3), encounter (stanza 4), decisive act (stanza 5), return/celebration (stanza 6). This roughly matches canonical arc order clearly and in sequence. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line is verbatim from the canonical poem. Phrases like “Did gyre and gimble” appear but are not exact lines because “on the deck” replaces original “in the wabe,” and second stanza shifted wording. The repeated final stanza is an echo but not verbatim original lines. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens present include: gyre, gimble, mome, borogoves, snicker-snack, vorpal, frabjous, callooh, callay. Count them: gyre, gimble, vorpal, snicker-snack, frabjous, callooh, callay. Only about 7 distinct canonical tokens total. So tokens ≤8, yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable pattern: Longer lines tend to have ≈8–9 syllables, shorter lines ≈5–7 syllables, e.g. “’Twas knotwind grim, and the braidy ropes” (8 syll), “Did gyre and gimble on the deck” (7 syll). Most stanzas maintain consistent longer-short alternation near Jabberwocky standard. So yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes vary across the poem: “deck/wreck,” “split/fit,” “sought/thought,” “flared/glared,” “snicker-snack/aback,” “boy/Callay” - six or more different (2,4) endings with no single exact ending repeated more than twice (mostly once). Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No word other than common function words or fixed phrases is overused beyond 5 times or 8% threshold. Even “Four-Strand” is repeated but less than 5 times or 8%. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages formed from distinct roots: knotwind (knot+wind), braidy (braid+y), fraysome (fray+some), strandly (strand+ly), spliceful (splice+ful), slipknot’s (slipknot + possessive form), fid (arguably specialized but distinct), tangly (tangle+y), knotty (knot+ty). These show ≥4 distinct roots; no single suffix dominates over 50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem is clearly about a knotting/splicing challenge modeled on Jabberwocky, staying on the subject of wrestling with \"Four-Strand\" knot-like foe. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond surface, poem implies a motif of mastering a tricky craft (knotting/splicing) with courage, patience, and skill, akin to the heroic fight, giving a subtle undertone of resolve and craftsmanship. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Majority show alternating line lengths with evident rhythm difference, e.g., stanza 1: \"grimble eve, and murky glades\" (long) vs \"Did wheeze and wobble in the shade\" (short? both similar?); some stanzas show more equal length lines. Pattern is uneven and borderline but on balance fewer than 60% clearly alternate longer/shorter lines with big content word length differences - no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme (2,4) in each quatrain is mostly maintained, with some slant rhymes (\"shade\" / \"blade\", \"brewed\"/\"mood\", \"sweep\"/\"deep\"). Avoids AABB dominance as most stanzas use ABCB or ABAB patterns in rhyme, with (2,4) rhyme dominant. In ≥60% stanzas (at least 5), lines 2 and 4 rhyme or slant rhyme - yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza repeats beginning stanza in structure and several content words (\"’Twas grimble eve, and murky glades\" repeat; wheeze and wobble, flimsy timber-blades). At least two repeated content phrases/words found. This constitutes a ring composition - yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Second stanza includes admonition: “Beware the Reglet, child of mine! Its splintered fangs… Beware the Furniture’s cruel align” - clearly an early warning/admonition - yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Third stanza shows preparation: “He took his vorpal axe in hand; Long time the grimful foe he scanned— Then rested by a tumble-stand, To ponder and withstand.” Preparation includes armament (axe), reconnaissance and resting before fight - yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Fourth stanza describes clear encounter: “And as in drouthy thought he stood, The Reglet… Came whirring… And roared…“ - clear protagonist-villain meeting - yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Fifth stanza shows decisive act: “One, two! One, two! And through and through The vorpal blade went snicker-snew! He slew the beast…” - decisive slaying action - yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>No clear return or celebration. Instead, sixth and seventh stanzas show new threat (The Furniture), culminating in entrapment and despair in stanza 7, stanza 8 is a somber repeat of beginning with fading hope. No jubilant acknowledgment or homecoming is present - no.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented words (coinages): grimble, wheeze, wobble (common/English?, wobble PoS as verb/noun?), flimsy (English), timber-blades (compound but English), Reglet, wrath (English), gnarled, Furniture (English common noun), tumble-stand (invented compound), drouthy, barken, brood, whirring, snicker-snew (coinage variant), rue (English), anew, grimful, gyre (canonical), galar, gafire. Coinage count excluding standard English and canonical Carroll words: Reglet, tumble-stand, drouthy, barken, snicker-snew, grimble, grimful, galar, gafire. That's about 9 distinct coinages - yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains ≥1 coinage: 1st (grimble), 2nd (Reglet, Furniture), 3rd (grimful, tumble-stand), 4th (drouthy, barken), 5th (snicker-snew), 6th (Furniture), 7th (gyre - canonical but counts), 8th (grimble). All stanzas have coinages - yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creatures: The Reglet and The Furniture. Both non-canonical and central. Reglet is main adversary initially, Furniture is new antagonist introduced later. Creature/entity named and central - yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts: \"snicker-snew\" (variant of snicker-snack), \"whirring\", \"roared\" (somewhat onomatopoeic), but strictly 2 clear pronounced burst words is borderline; \"snicker-snew\" counts definitely; \"whirring\" less a burst, more sound description. Possibly only 1 strong onomatopoeic burst plus one weak. Not clearly ≥2 strong bursts - no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: stanza 1 “grimble… glades”, “wheeze and wobble”, stanza 2 “splintered fangs, gnarled design”, stanza 4 “drouthy thought”, “barken brood”, stanza 7 “oaken limbs in silent sweep” - at least 2 stanzas with clear intentional alliteration/consonance - yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration. The poem has warning (2), preparation (3), encounter (4), decisive slaying (5), but then introduces a new monster in (6), trap in (7), despair (7), and no return or celebration (10). The final stanzas break the typical arc order by adding a new encounter and defeat after slaying. Arc is disrupted. So strict canonical order is not maintained - no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No exact verbatim lines from Carroll’s poem; all lines are distinct but mimic style. No copying - yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens from Carroll’s poem appearing: \"’Twas\", \"vorpal\", \"snicker-\" variant (snicker-snew), \"gyre\" appears once, \"blade\" (attempted via \"axe\", which is different word), \"beamish\" not present, \"chortled\" no, \"Jabberwock\" not named. Canonical tokens ≤8. Probably within limits - yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts roughly: Longer lines mostly around 8–9 syllables, shorter lines 5–7 syllables. Examples stanza 1: “’Twas grimble eve, and murky glades” (7 syllables: ’Twas(1), grim-ble(2), eve(1), and(1), mur-ky(2), glades(1) = 8?), “Did wheeze and wobble in the shade” (7 syllables). Variable but close to pattern. Majority of stanzas fit pattern - yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme (2,4) end words are varied across stanzas: shade, blade, design, align, scanned, withstand, brood, mood, through, rue, creep, sweep, dire, gyre, mine, shine, etc. No exact end word reused over 2 times except ring echo repetition in final stanza, so varied rhyme endings - yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No excessively repeated content words. Repeated words like \"Reglet\" and \"Furniture\" are central characters but do not exceed usage limits given content totals. No lexical repetition guard violation - yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show multiple distinct roots: Reglet, grimble, drouthy, barken, snicker-snew, galar, gafire, tumble-stand, grimful - at least 4 distinct roots, no single suffix dominates. Coinage variety sufficient - yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem clearly addresses the fantastical confrontation with “Reglet” and \"Furniture\" as adversaries; topic adheres to imagined Jabberwocky-style poem with a unique subject without shifting to unrelated topic - yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem introduces escalating threats; initial confident slaying leads to new challenge and ultimate entrapment, ending not in celebration but despair. Possible undertones of futility or continual struggle, a darker twist than Carroll’s original.

Words like “blade,” “Verglance,” “skelter” appear but not excessively.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show variety with at least 4 distinct roots: e.g. glimmer-, sleeth-, skelter-, crag-, frozzen-, shivvered-, slith- roots used; no single suffix dominates.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem addresses “Verglance” and “Granthrum” conflict context clearly, consistent with a fantasy battle topic akin to original; no subject drift.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext is moderately coherent: implied motif of a perilous, mythic wintery encounter and rite of passage, matching mood of original; some undertone of struggle against harsh natural forces.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}
