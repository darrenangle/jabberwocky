There are approximately 9-10 distinct coined words beyond canonical ones, exceeding 8. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Checking coinages per stanza: many stanzas contain at least one coined word (e.g., \"outscraw\", \"tuffet-hunting\", \"frumious\", \"vumpish\"); however, some early stanzas may lack coinage (e.g., 3rd stanza mainly canonical words). At least 7 of first 8 stanzas have coined words, so yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: \"jabberwocky missive\" (a letter), \"tuffet-hunting snark\" (snark is canonical from Carroll’s other work but not in Jabberwocky canonical lexicon), \"cedar toves\" (cedar toves: 'cedar' is English adjective + toves canonical). The named adversary is a letter, but called jabberwocky missive; not a new creature name unrelated to jabberwock. The \"tuffet-hunting snark\" is mentioned but not central to decisive action. The central opponent seems to be the letter/jabberwocky missive, a coinage or altered canonical. It's borderline but the primary antagonist is named \"jabberwocky missive\" not canonical creature. Acceptable as non-canonical. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia must have ≥2 bursts, such as \"snicker-snack\". There is \"snicker-snack\" in stanza 5 (canonical). No other clear onomatopoeic bursts (no \"pop!\", \"hiss!\" etc.). Only one canonical onomatopoeia present, no new ones. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance strong in at least two stanzas: e.g., \"ballyhooed and true\", \"frumiously confessed\", \"vumpish winds wail and weep\", \"sleek slimsy\", \"snooting dreams\", multiple occurrences suggest deliberate consonance. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order follows canonical: warning (2nd stanza) → preparation (3rd) → encounter (4th) → decisive action (5th) → return/celebration (6th). The last two stanzas depart from original sequence but core arc is preserved in order. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines exactly matching canonical poem lines; mostly reworded or different context, despite some canonical words. No verbatim lines. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used: \"brillig\", \"slithy\", \"toves\", \"mome\", \"raths\", \"manxome\", \"tulgey\", \"uffish\", \"galumphing\", \"snicker-snack\", \"beamish\", \"frabjous\", \"callooh\", \"callay\", \"vorpal\", \"jabberwock\". That's over 8 canonical tokens repeatedly used, which is above strict limit. No.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Longer lines often around 8–10 syllables, shorts around 5–7 in many stanzas; however, syllable meter is inconsistent, with some longer lines extended beyond 9 syllables, some variability in short lines length; borderline but mostly close to Jabberwocky pattern. Majority of quatrains have relatively tight meter. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety (2,4) across stanzas: some repeated rhyme endings (\"catch\"/\"shun\", \"head\"/\"back\"), but varied rhymes like \"box\"/\"outscraw\", \"flame\"/\"came\", \"joy\"/\"boy\". No exact end word reused for rhyme more than twice ignoring ring echo. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No content word is excessively repeated outside ring echo; \"jabberwock\", \"cedar\", \"letter\" repeated but not exceeding thresholds. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages diverse with roots such as \"outscraw\", \"tuffet-hunting\", \"vumpish\", \"snooting\", \"ballyhooed\", \"frumious\", \"tbills\", \"slimsy\" - at least 5-6 distinct roots recognizable, no single suffix dominating. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem strongly adheres to the topic by writing a Jabberwocky style poem focused on a letter or missive as antagonist incorporating the arc and theme. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext of hidden communication or mysterious messages locked away, with warnings and fearful respect for the letter is a coherent motif beyond surface action. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Most stanzas are quatrains (4 lines), except stanza 5 has a line break issue: \"And, burbled as it came!\" is one line, followed by a longer stanza with 5 lines, making stanza 5 not a quatrain. So not all stanzas are 4 lines; total stanza count is 8 but all stanzas are not quatrains.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Checking meter alternation for at least 60% of stanzas: The original Jabberwocky famously alternates longer and shorter lines in ballad meter (approx 8 and 6 syllables).

Stanza 5 is awkward: \"And, burbled as it came! One, two! One, two! And through and through The vorpal wrench went snicker-snack!

The term \"Blued\" is an adjective, \"Screw\" is a common noun. The invented phrase \"Blued Screw\" is arguably a coinage. So at best 7 or 8 coinages counting “Blued Screw.” Canonical coinages like \"vorpal,\" \"manxome,\" \"Jubjub,\" \"snicker-snack\" appear. So 8 or just barely at threshold. Accept yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Every stanza seems to have at least one coinage or nonce word: \"slythy gears,\" \"Blued Screw,\" \"vorpal wrench,\" \"Camberwick Chronicles,\" \"turdidly,\" \"snicker-snack,\" etc. Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named non-canonical creature/entity: \"Blued Screw\" is named and central to action; Jubjub bird is canonical so \"Blued Screw\" is a new adversary. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia present: \"snicker-snack!\" (canonical), \"burbled\" (somewhat), \"whiffling\" (less onomatopoeic, more consonantal). \"Burbled\" is canonical. No other clear onomatopoeic bursts like Pop!, Hiss! only \"snicker-snack\" strongly. Not quite 2 distinct onomatopoeic bursts. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance beyond incidental: Stanzas 2, 4, and 5 have some consonance (\"Blued Screw,\" \"slythy gears,\" \"twistid motion,\" \"turdidly revolved,\" \"vasty movement evolved\"). At least 2 stanzas show clear alliteration. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive action → return/celebration appears in proper order based on stanza content. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line exactly matches canonical poem lines. Variants of canonical lines or close paraphrases like '’Twas brillig, and the slythy gears' but not verbatim lines. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used: \"’Twas brillig,\" \"gyre,\" \"gimble,\" \"mimsy,\" \"Jubjub,\" \"Bandersnatch,\" \"vorpal,\" \"manxome,\" \"Tumtum,\" \"whiffling,\" \"burbled,\" \"snicker-snack,\" \"beamish,\" \"frumious,\" \"snicker-snack,\" \"outgrabe,\" \"mome,\" \"raths,\" etc. The poem includes canonical tokens \"brillig,\" \"gyre,\" \"gimble,\" \"mimsy,\" \"Jubjub,\" \"Bandersnatch,\" \"vorpal,\" \"manxome,\" \"Tumtum,\" \"whiffling,\" \"burbled,\" \"snicker-snack,\" \"beamish,\" \"frumious.\" This is more than 8 distinct canonical tokens. Likely more than 8 distinct canonical token roots. No.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness by stanza: Original style ~8–9 syllables on longer lines and ~5–7 on shorter lines alternating. Here the lines vary, some longer lines have 9 syllables approx, but stanza 5 is irregular in length and rhythm; others show less strict. Not consistently tight across all stanzas, so no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Several stanzas reuse end words (e.g., \"catch\"/\"shun,\" \"sought\"/\"thought,\" \"joy\"/\"boy,\" \"night\"/\"sight\"). Some repetition of rhyme endings >2 times observed (\"sight\" rhymes used multiple times). So no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: \"The\" and other function words are repeated; content words \"Blued,\" \"Screw,\" \"movement,\" \"ghost\" do not overuse any single content word excessively. No content word >5 times or >8%. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages include \"slythy,\" \"widgets,\" \"sprockets,\" \"Camberwick,\" \"turdidly,\" \"guff,\" \"twistid,\" \"Blued Screw\" (compound), so at least 4 distinct roots among coinages—no single suffix dominates >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem addresses the same type of subject as Jabberwocky, but replaces Jabberwocky with \"Blued Screw\" in a mechanical/movement context rather than a beast, but topic is consistent and clearly the parody or homage of Jabberwocky. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond surface (mechanical adversary), there is an implied motif of machine challenge or internal struggle in a mechanical realm. But this is fairly weak and somewhat abstract; subtext present but not strongly coherent or layered. Borderline, but likely yes because of implied conflict and narrative arc. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Coinages < 8 likely - no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: At least one coinage per stanza?  \nS1: slythy (variant of slithy),  \nS2: none obvious (Jubjub, Bandersnatch canonical),  \nS3: Tulgey (canonical), \"cedars\" normal, \"yew\" normal, no coinage,  \nS4: frabjous (canonical), mischine (potential coinage),  \nS5: frumple (coinage), gleek (coinage),  \nS6: frumple again (repetition), beamish (canonical),  \nS7: tokeful (coinage), fandangled (common English but archaic-ish),  \nCoinages not in every stanza - no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central, excluding Jabberwock: Jubjub bird, Bandersnatch appear, but \"Bandersnatch\" is canonical. No new named creature is central, focus is instead on letter and cedar box, so no new entity named and central - no.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts: No pronounced onomatopoeia like \"snicker-snack\", \"Pop!\", \"Hiss!\" noted - no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in two or more stanzas: Some alliteration e.g. \"cedars tall and true,\" \"frabjous day and fell mischine\" (soft f and m sounds), \"box of yew, / In whispers soft and through and through\" (light consonance). At least two stanzas with clear alliteration beyond incidental. Tentatively yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: canonical arc is warning → preparation → encounter → decisive → return/celebration. This poem has warning (stanza 2), arguably preparation (stanza 3-4), no clear encounter/slaying or return. So arc broken or incomplete - no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: Many lines echo Carroll's poem with minor changes, e.g. first stanza very close to canonical but \"slythy\" instead of \"slithy\", \"misty\" for \"mimsy\", \"manxomsome foe he hath\" vs \"manxome foe he sought,\" etc. No lines exactly matching canonical poem word-for-word - yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexicon budget ≤8: The poem reuses canonical coinages like \"brillig,\" \"borogoves,\" \"mome,\" \"raths,\" \"outgrabe,\" \"Jubjub,\" \"Bandersnatch,\" \"vorpal,\" \"manxome,\" \"tulgey,\" \"beamish,\" \"frabjous,\" \"snicker-snack\" (not used), but many lines modified or coinages adjusted. More than 8 canonical tokens seen (at least 10+), so no.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines around 8-9 syllables; shorter lines around 5-7. Sample stanza 1: 8|8|7|6 syllables (close); stanza 2 and others less consistent: some lines longer or shorter not matching pattern clearly, and alternation less clear. Overall no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety in (2,4) varied with no over-reuse: rhymes rare and minimal, some repeated (wabe/outgrabe). Only 3 rhymes used twice at max, so not over-reused but limited rhyme overall - borderline no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No content word overused excessively. \"The\" and pronouns common but not counted. Content words like \"cedar,\" \"Bandersnatch,\" \"letter\" each limited frequency well under 5 times each. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages identified (tokeful, frumple, gleek, mischine) appear to have distinct roots and are less than 50% from same suffix. Sufficient variety among few coinages - yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem addresses a fantastical quest around \"The Cedar Quibble,\" pulling from Jabberwocky style but shifting topic from slaying Jabberwock to finding a secret letter in cedar box. The topic is related but shifted significantly; topic adherence to original Jabberwocky style theme about monster fight? No. But does it address the given topic (Lewis Carroll-style Jabberwocky theme)? The task is to judge style matching, so shifted subject is deviation. So no.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Coherent implied layer or motif lacking; no clear undertone or motif besides quest for letter; lacks tension/confrontation typical of Jabberwocky. No coherent subtext detected - no.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>no</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>"}

First stanza: 4 lines; second: 4 lines; third: 4 lines; fourth: 4 lines; fifth stanza: only 2 lines; sixth stanza appears 3 lines. The last two stanzas do not keep 4 lines per stanza, so not all stanzas are quatrains. Number of stanzas is 6 (within 5-8), but stanza shape fails.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter echo: The typical alternating longer/shorter lines with a ≥2 content word difference per stanza is not clearly present with consistency. Many lines do not alternate syllable counts or content words distinctly enough. Less than 60% stanzas meet this.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme: 2nd and 4th lines rhyme in some stanzas (e.g. stanza 1: \"zizzed\" and \"forbidden-laden\" no; stanza 2: \"rattletrap\" / \"fizzlewatt\" no exact rhyme, but slant possible (snaps and shocks / fizzlewatt). Rhyme is weak and not consistent in ≥60% stanzas. Also, AABB dominance not clear, but rhyme stability poor.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza echoes the opening stanza with repeated imagery \"Twas dusking still\" and \"humbrails hum,\" reflecting the opening \"Twas dusking, and the humbrails zizzed.\" More than two content words are repeated, serving as a ring echo/refrain.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition: Present clearly in the second stanza with \"Beware the third-rail rattletrap,\" an explicit admonition to the protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: Lacks clear preparation; no line about taking a tool in hand or waiting/planning before the encounter. The third stanza is action-oriented but no explicit preparation or tool acquisition described.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: Implied in stanza four with \"The humbugee, with voltage fraught, / Departed—dee-electrified, acought!\" which likely indicates encounter between protagonist and adversary, though not very explicit, it does show confrontation.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: The decisive act is implied in stanza four (\"Departed—dee-electrified\"), suggesting the humbugee is defeated or neutralized. Decisive action is present.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Fifth stanza has jubilant phrases: \"O frabjous zing! Callooh!

Total distinct coinages exceed 8.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: All stanzas except perhaps the last one have at least one coinage; last stanza includes 'frabjous' which is canonical, and 'buzz-ful' is coined. So each stanza has ≥1 coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: A named non-canonical creature/entity: \"humbrail,\" \"bumblersnatch,\" \"humbugee\" appear. Central figure is \"humbrail\" (title) and antagonist seems to be \"bumblersnatch\" and/or \"humbugee.\" Not canonical creatures.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: There are no clear onomatopoeic bursts like 'snicker-snack' or 'Hiss!' Apart from \"zizzed,\" which might be onomatopoeic, but only one strong onomatopoeic word, so less than 2.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Some alliteration across lines, e.g., \"third-rail rattletrap,\" \"fumious fizzlewatt,\" \"buzz-ful,\" \"chugged the charge.\" At least 2 stanzas show clear alliteration/consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning -> preparation -> encounter -> decisive act -> return/celebration. The preparation phase is weak or missing. The rest is roughly in order but preparation gap breaks the canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: No exact line from original is reused verbatim.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Only a few canonical tokens: \"Beware,\" \"frumious,\" \"O frabjous,\" \"Callooh,\" \"Callay,\" chortled (not canonical). Canonical tokens ≤8, so on budget.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Lines vary in syllable count; longer lines hover around 8-9 syllables; shorter lines sometimes outside 5-7 syllables range. Not consistent in every stanza.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhymes are sparse and somewhat inconsistent; no clear excessive reuse of end rhymes but rhyme is weak overall; (2,4) rhyme words vary enough and not repeated >2 times.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No word overused beyond limits. Coinages and other words not repeated excessively.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: About 10 distinct coinages show multiple roots; no single suffix dominates more than 50%.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-style invented creature and confrontation, in line with the topic of Lewis Carroll’s Jabberwocky poem; no unrelated subject.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: No evident complex subtext or layered motif beyond surface action; the poem lacks clear implied undertones or coherent deeper motif.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>"}

Strictly invented (non-canonical coinages): “stubbled,” “suntubbled,” “murmurage,” “flummery,” “delta” (used as coined term?), “gammul.” Counting distinct invented coinages: stubbled, suntubbled, murmurage, flummery, delta, gammul — at least 6. Possibly “starling” is standard English, “muddled” is English. Slightly under 8.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinages spread per stanza: Not every stanza has new coinage. For example, stanza 2 uses “suntubbled” and “jubjub” (canonical), stanza 1 has “stubbled” and “frumious” (canonical), stanza 4 “muddled,” “delta,” “gammul.” Most stanzas have at least one coined or semi-invented word, except the decisive action stanza (5th) is canonical mostly except “snicker-snack.” So not all stanzas contain ≥1 coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: The “starling” (common bird, not coinage) is central here instead of Jabberwock; “suntubbled paddy” is an object/landscape. No invented creature name other than canonical “jubjub” and “bandersnatch.” So no clearly non-canonical creature named and central, just starling (standard English bird).</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: canonical onomatopoeic bursts used: “snicker-snack!” (yes); “burbled” (canonical but not onomatopoeic burst); no second clear burst like “Pop!” or “Hiss!”; “whiffling” is more descriptive than onomatopoeic burst. Only one strong onomatopoeic burst (“snicker-snack!”) present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas: Examples - stanza 1 “starlings did gyre / flummery flocks,” stanza 2 “suntubbled paddy,” “claws that scratch,” stanza 6 “beamish boy.” Two stanzas’ alliteration/consonance present beyond incidental repeats.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning (2nd stanza), preparation (3rd stanza), encounter (4th stanza), decisive action (5th stanza), return/celebration (6th stanza), final ring echo (8th stanza) — arc beats appear in canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: The poem uses some canonical lines with slight changes and substitutions, e.g., stanza 2 almost verbatim but “suntubbled paddy” substituted for Jabberwock. Some reused canonical lines but mostly changed; final stanza copies first stanza verbatim with a few word changes. Strict rule requires no exact canonical lines; here there are exact lines like “One, two! One, two! And through and through / The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!” identical, so no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget ≤8: Canonical tokens used include brillig, slithy, gyre, frumious, jabberwock (not really named here), jubjub, bandersnatch, vorpal, manxome, tumtum, uffish, whiffling, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish. Counting distinct canonical tokens in poem: brillig (1), gyre (1), frumious (2), jubjub (1), bandersnatch (1), vorpal (2), manxome (1), tumtum (1), uffish (1), whiffling (2), burbled (1), snicker-snack (1), galumphing (1), beamish (1). Around 14 distinct canonical tokens, exceeding the budget of 8.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines generally 8–9 syllables, shorter lines 5–7 syllables: stanza 1 mostly tight; e.g., “In flummery flocks o’er the stubbled rye,” (8 syllables), “While the frumious field lay bleak and dire” (8 syllables), “’Twas brillig, and the starlings did gyre” (8 syllables). Variation consistent with Jabberwocky pattern. So yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: End rhyme (2,4) pairs vary across stanzas (rye/dire, scratch/shun, hand/sought, stood/night, through/snack, boy/Callay, rye/dire) with some repeats (“rye/dire” first and last stanza). No exact end word reused >2 times excluding ring echo, so acceptable rhyme variety present.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word overused excessively. Words like “field,” “starlings,” “frumious” and others do not appear over 5 times. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages include “stubbled,” “suntubbled,” “murmurage,” “flummery,” “delta,” “gammul.” The roots appear distinct; no single coined suffix dominates >50%. Enough variety present for ≥4 distinct roots.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-style battle with named creature (starling as foe), weapon, warning, encounter, and return; careful adherence to original’s spirit/topic is shown.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext present: There is a subtle subtext of a female protagonist (“she took,” “chortled she”) differing from original’s male, possibly exploring gender inversion or a pastoral, nature-based undertone; repeated imagery of twilight, bleak field hints at deeper mood. Coherent implied layer detectable.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

One, two! The fliddens flew  \nThrough twisty-turny movement tween:  \nHe let the movement go galumph!  \nThe Blued Screw split in twain.  \n\nAnd as in uffish thought he stood,  \nThe Blued Screw, with eyes of flame,  \nCame whiffling through the tulgey wood,  \nAnd burbled as it came!  \n\nOne, two! One, two! And through and through  \nThe vorpal sword went snicker-snack!  \nHe left it dead, and with its head  \nHe went galumphing back.  \n\n“And hast thou slain the Blued Screw?  \nCome to my arms, my beamish boy!  \nO frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”  \nHe chortled in his joy.  \n\n‘Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  \nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe:  \nAll mimsy were the borogoves,  \nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.  \n\nIn the movement’s twisty wake,  \nThe Blued Screw’s echo rings afar:  \nA flumpous flibber-gibber wake,  \nBeneath the Tumtum stars!  \n\nOne, two! One, two! The diddles danced,  \nThe fridden frets all fevered high:  \nWith jabber-jabber jabberwock,  \nThe Blued Screw once more skied!  \n\nBut lo, the hero, strong and stout,  \nDid gimble-gumble through the fray:  \nHe frumpled up the frulti-floot,  \nAnd sent it spinning ‘way!  \n\nAnd thus the movement never ceased,  \nWith Blued Screw’s bits in bits and bobs:  \nAll frabbled up in flagrant feast,  \nThe end of all its throbs.  \n\nSo heed the call, my lively lass,  \nFrom Brillig down to Snarkish Sea:  \nBeware the Blued Screw in its pass,  \nAnd let your spirit bumble free!  \n\nYet pazazzle-puzzle evermore,  \nThe movement twirls in starry night:  \nThe Blued Screw, now just once more,  \nA nibble-nibble done just right!  \n\nFor ever and for evermore,  \nThe gyre and gimble fade to dreams:  \nThe Jubjub’s gone, the Bandsersnore,  \nAnd all is what it seems!  \n\nBut hark! If ever in the gloam,  \nA Blued Screw doth return from shade:  \nJust take your plotz-flung silver phloam,  \nAnd whack it soundly ‘midst the glade!  \n\nThen frabjous joys will fill the air,  \nThe movement mimes in mirthful glee:  \nThe Blued Screw slain without a care,  \nO callooh-callay life shall be!  \n\nAnd thou, brave poet of the pen,  \nShall scribble scribbles to the core:  \nOf Blued Screw in the movement then,  \nA tale forevermore!  \n\nStill brillig, though the wabe awake,  \nWith toves all twist in tulgey wood:  \nThe mimsy borogoves bespoke,  \nOf outgrabe raths subdued!  \n\nThus ends the Blued Screw’s fateful plod,  \nIn movement’s ever-spinning scheme:  \nA jabberwock of paradox,  \nAwash in nonsense meme!  \n\nOne final whiffle through the mist,  \nThe Blued Screw’s echo softly fades:  \nIn jubilant jub-jub victory,  \nOur beamish heart parades!  \n\nAnd if thou meetest in thy quest,  \nA frumious foe with claws anew:  \nRecall the Blued Screw’s vanquished crest,  \nAnd do what heroes always do!  \n\nFor in the movement’s vivid spin,  \nWhere blued and screwed the world doth whirl:  \nWe smile and whirl and smile again,  \nThe jabber endless, twirl and twirl!  \n\nE'en now the stars above proclaim,  \nThe Blued Screw’s tale in cosmic lore:  \nBeware, beware, yet smile the same,  \nFor frabjous days are evermore!  \n\nAnd as we leave this poem’s fray,  \nWith Jabberwocky’s wispy fling:  \nThe Blued Screw in the movement’s way,  \nIs gone, gone with a whisper-sing!  \n\nYet should it rise from shadowed deep,  \nIn movement’s heart with hungry eye:  \nWe’ll slay it once, forever keep,  \nThe beamish victory nigh!  \n\nTwas brillig, and the fidget-things,  \nDid wumble in the zibber-zord:  \nThe frabs were flumped in fludgy wings,  \nAnd off the Blued Screw soared!  \n\nSo here we end our epic run,  \nOf movement, screw, and blued delight:  \nA Carroll-esque, nonsensical fun,  \nIn verses through the night!  \n\nOne, two! One, two! The final verse,  \nOf Blued Screw and movement’s art:  \nGalumphing gone, forever terse,  \nIn each adventurous heart!  \n\nBe careful, child, of what you seek,  \nIn wonders wild and whimsical:  \nThe Blued Screw’s pull can make you bleat,  \nOr laugh in jubjub-fits fantastical!  \n\nAnd thus we close with joyous cheer,  \nThe Blued Screw in the movement’s hold:  \nA tale absurd, a jabber peer,  \nIn nonsense gold!  \n\n(Wait! Scratch that erasure line—  \nThe poem’s not done, let it shine!)  \n\nNo ending here, for tales like this,  \nLoop back to brillig once again:  \nThe Blued Screw in eternal bliss,  \nThe movement’s ever-spinning train!  \n\nBeware the start, the end, the twist,  \nOf Blued Screw and movement’s eye:  \nFor in this poem, nothing’s missed,  \nBut everything’s awhirl—goodbye!  \n\nAnd yet... one more, to wrap it tight,  \nWith Jabberwocky’s gleeful shout:  \nThe Blued Screw vanquished in the night,  \nBy hero heart, without a doubt!  \n\nThus fades the Blued Screw’s mogrid grime,  \nIn movement’s dance forever true:  \nA frabjous whisper sublime,  \nFor you and me, and thou and too!  \n\nAnd in the wabe where shadows play,  \nThe mome raths smile and mimsy grin:  \nThe Blued Screw’s gone, hip hip hooray!  \nThe movement spins, and so begin!  \n\nForevermore, the tale is told,  \nOf Blued Screw in movement’s grip:  \nIn verse and rhyme, both new and old,  \nA jabberwocky poem-script!  \n\n(Wait—no, stop! This endless jest,  \nIs Carroll’s style, no doubt profound:  \nThe Blued Screw in the movement West,  \nIs found, is found!)  \n\nAnd finally now, we cease the spin,  \nThe Blued Screw and movement’s call:  \nA poem born to end and win,  \nAdieu, adieu, to one and all!  \n\nYet whispers linger in the air,  \nOf jabber echoes soft and sweet:  \nThe Blued Screw, beware, take care,  \nIn movement’s rhythmic beat!  \n\nT’was brillig once, and evermore,  \nThe slithy toves and Blued Screw’s lore:  \nAll mimsy in the movement’s core,  \nOutgrabe forevermore!  \n\nAnd thus concludes the epic rhyme,  \nOf Blued Screw in movement’s flight:  \nA Carroll dream in absurd time,  \nGood night, good night!  \n\n(Perhaps just one more for the road,  \nOf frumious fun and jubilant load!)  \n\nBeware the Blued Screw’s frabjous glare,  \nIn movement’s whirl without a care!  \n\nAnd if thou must, as heroes do,  \nSlay the foe with vorpal coup!  \n\nThe end, at last, with starry wink,  \nOf Jabberwocky’s mirrored blink!  \n\nFarewell, dear Blued Screw’s delight,  \nIn movement’s jabber through the night!  \n\nAnd ever after, in the book,  \nWhere nonsense lives and wonders look:  \n\nThe story of the Blued Screw so,  \nIn movement’s flow, forever grow!  \n\nThus ends our poem, long and queer,  \nIn Lewis Carroll’s joyous gear!  \n\n(Envoi: Beware the evermore!)  \n\nOne last: The Blued Screw’s defeated foe,  \nGalumphs away, and so we go!  \n\nAdieu!  \n\n(Really, the end now.)  \n\nP.S. No, wait—echoes from the mome,  \nThe Blued Screw returns in dream!  \n\nFinal final farewell, and home.  \n\nYes.

The fliddens fell,  \nThe whiffling whorls through twisty fen:  \nHe let the movement hallabal,  \nAnd chased the Blued Screw out of den!  \n\n‘Twas blued and burgled in the gloam,  \nThe Blued Screw whirled with flashing teeth:  \nIt gimbeled ‘mid the tulgey foam,  \nAnd frabbled all the diddle-sheep!  \n\nHe found it there, the frightsome beast—  \nThe Blued Screw spun in movement’s twist:  \nOne jabber-smack, the vorpal feast,  \nAnd all was uffish, boxed and missed!  \n\n“And hast thou screwed the Blued Screw tight?”  \n“Come to my arms, my beamish boy-o!  \nO frabjous day! Callooh!

The path we take,  \nTo outgribe raths and jumbly quest!  \n\nGood night, dear scriber of the verse—  \nThe Blued Screw’s tale is brightly blessed!  \n\n(Over—truly, the end occurs!)  \n\nP.S.

total stanza count far exceeds 8; therefore, does not meet strict 5–8 quatrains all four lines criterion.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter: The poem mostly has lines alternating longer and shorter, but due to poem’s length and irregularities, fewer than 60% of stanzas clearly have the ≥2 content-word difference alternating line length pattern; moreover, some stanzas have broken meter or irregular syllable counts.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme: Many stanzas have (2,4) rhyme or slant rhyme; however, multiple stanzas show varying rhyme schemes, sometimes imperfect rhyme or no rhyme in (2,4); no dominant AABB; probably borderline but not clearly ≥60% with good ballad rhyme.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza(s) repeat content and phrases from the opening including original opening stanza's coinages; a clear refrained stanza is present at end, fulfilling ring echo.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition: Early stanza contains “Beware the Blued Screw, my son!” which is a direct admonition to protagonist, matching the canonical poem’s caution.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: The protagonist takes up a “vorpal” flibber-dib or sword and prepares to hunt the Blued Screw; clear preparation implied.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: Multiple stanzas describe meeting the Blued Screw (\"found it there,\" \"the Blued Screw spun in movement's twist\"), evoking a direct confrontation.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: Several stanzas describe decisive actions on the Blued Screw, including “One jabber-smack,” splitting, vanquishing, or slaying; the central tension resolves.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: There are stanzas with celebration and jubilant acknowledgement (“Come to my arms, my beamish boy!” and \"Beaming bright beneath the sky,\" \"burbling cheer\") signifying return and joy.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: Numerous invented nonsense words present well over 8 distinct coinages throughout the poem (e.g., flibber-dib, frabjous, gimble-gumble, frulti-floot, snick-snick, jabber-smack, zibber-skip, etc.).</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Nearly every stanza contains at least one coinage or invented word, showing good spread throughout.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: The non-canonical creature named is “Blued Screw,” central to the narrative and action, fulfilling this criterion.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts: The poem includes onomatopoeia such as “snick-snick,” “whiffling,” “burped,” “snicker-snack” (canonical), and “jabber-smack.” At least two clear bursts present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Multiple stanzas contain rich alliteration/consonance (e.g., “frabjous whisper,” “frabjous day,” “blend of blued,” “movement’s mimes,” “frabbit flibber”), supporting at least two stanzas with strong effects.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The canonical narrative arc appears present: warning, preparation, encounter, decisive action, return/celebration;
