Thus criterion not met.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter check requires ≥60% stanzas with alternating longer/shorter lines by ≥2 content words. Mixed stanza lengths disrupt consistent pattern; many lines irregular. Overall less than 60% have clear ballad meter alternation.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme pattern (2,4) is present in early quatrain-like stanzas, but later stanzas deviate, often with different rhyme schemes and some stanzas not quatrains; AABB dominance seen and irregular rhyme patterns prevail. Fails ≥60% with (2,4) rhyme pattern avoiding AABB dominance.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza partially echoes opening stanza lines and phrases (brillig, tulgey, mome, mimsy) repeatedly, with a reflective refrain feel; at least 2 content words echoed. So yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present in stanza 2: \"Beware the Reglet, my son! ... Beware the Furniture...\" — clear caution to protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation present: protagonist takes vorpal sword in hand, rests by Tumtum tree, stands in thought before encounter, showing preparation and resolve.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter present: \"The Reglet, with eyes of flame, Came whiffling through the tulgey wood\" and \"And burbled as it came!\" indicates clear meeting between protagonist and adversary.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action present: \"One, two! One, two! And through and through The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!

Overall >8 distinct coinages not canonical standard words, ignoring canonical tokens. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Not every stanza contains at least one coinage; coinages concentrated in some but not all. Some stanzas are canonical wording or standard English. So no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: Reglet (non-canonical) and Furniture (personified as a foe). Furniture as entity is unusual but named and focal. So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"snicker-snack\" (canonical), \"burble-cry\", \"snickersnee\" (less clearly onomatopoeic, but snicker-snack is present). Only one or two clear onomatopoeic bursts, \"snicker-snack\" and \"burbled\" (semi-onomatopoeic). At least 2 present, so yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance strong in multiple stanzas: “frumious cheers attest”, “frumious zest”, “giggled, laughed”, “whimsy-wide,” and other examples in different stanzas. At least two stanzas with clear use beyond incidental, so yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order mostly canonical: warning/admonition early, preparation next, then encounter, decisive action, and return celebration. However, extended return celebration after the canonical ending and addition of further stanzas is a slight deviation but arc order overall intact. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No exact verbatim canonical line matches found; lines lifted often slightly altered or with added punctuation/capitalization changes. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token budget exceeded slightly: many canonical words repeated (brillig, slithy, toves, gyre, gimble, wabe, mimsy, mome, raths, outgrabe, jabberwocky, frumious, snicker-snack, burbled, beamish). The presence of \"jabberwocky\" in penultimate stanza and multiple canonical terms repeated more than 8 tokens—borderline but close to 8. Strictly no (prefer fewer canonical tokens).</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Many stanzas have lines outside 8–9 and 5–7 syllables; lines often longer or shorter; meter is inconsistent and does not tightly match Jabberwocky’s typical ~8/6 syllable scheme in all quatrains. Fail.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme pattern shows repeated rhyme words (catch/shun), (head/back), (joy/delight), some repetition over 2 times across stanzas, and some reused endings. No strong variety of ending rhymes maintained. So no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No evidence of any content word overused excessively; lexical repetition reasonable and controlled outside ring echo. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety is good with multiple distinct roots: Reglet, snickersnee, burble-cry, whimsy-wide, gibing suffixes, verb forms, etc. No suffix dominates. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem clearly addresses the original Jabberwocky topic and mythos (protagonist hunting/defeating a fearsome creature), with named substitute creatures Reglet and Furniture. So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext is somewhat vague but discernible: triumph over fears/adversaries, passage from danger to joy, celebration of heroic journey, sense of whimsy and nonsense underlying all. Coherent undertone detectable.
