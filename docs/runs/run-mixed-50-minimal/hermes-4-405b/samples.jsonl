Count lines per stanza: first stanza 4 lines, second 4, third 4, fourth 4, fifth 3, sixth 3, seventh 4, eighth 4. Two stanzas have <4 lines (5th and 6th have 3 lines). So not all stanzas have 4 lines. Total stanza count 8 is good. But all stanzas must be quatrains: no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter echo: check ≥60% of stanzas show longer/shorter line alternation with ≥2 content words difference line to line. The original poem typically alternates 8–9 syll. lines with 5–6 syll. lines. Here many lines vary but not consistently. Also skipping stanzas with 3 lines. Among quatrains: mostly alternating length is unclear or weak, borderline. Less than 60% clearly follow alternating long-short lines. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme (lines 2 and 4 rhyme at least 60% of stanzas, with no AABB dominance): rhyme pairs in stanzas mostly: stanza1 (lines2-4: “tall” / “brawl”) rhyme; stanza2 (pause/ironjaw) half rhyme; stanza3 (mien/screen) rhyme; stanza4 (flame/came) rhyme; stanza5 only 3 lines, lines2 and 4 missing; stanza6 only 3 lines (no 4th line); stanza7 (me/Callooh/Callay) 2-4 lines missing or different; stanza8 (side/gleams) no rhyme in 2,4 positions; rhyme coverage ≈4-5 stanzas rhyme (out of 8); over 60%. Slant rhyme present. No evidence of AABB dominance (only one clear AABB is stanza8? No, no AABB). So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: final stanza contains content words echoing the opening stanza (original “brillig,” “slithy toves,” “gyre and gimble in the wabe”). In model, final stanza references \"hero,\" \"wood and woe,\" \"spanner-sword,\" \"gleams\" — no clear repeated content words or phrases from first stanza (“Reglet,” “Furnitree,” “chair-legs,” “cupboard giants”). Final stanza does not echo the opening stanza clearly with repeated words or a refrain. No ring echo: no.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition present early: second stanza includes “Beware the Reglet's crafty claws! … Beware … shun the Ironjaw!” clearly admonition. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament before encounter: protagonist takes \"his trusty spanner-sword in hand,\" rests by a screen before the encounter. Matches the preparation phase. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter with adversary: fourth stanza describes the Reglet with eyes of flame coming through underwood, matching clear confrontation. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: fifth stanza describes blade going snicker-snack, leaving Reglet dead with its head, clear decisive act. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: sixth and seventh stanzas include celebration and chortling joy, and hero’s return with spanner-sword; but stanza 6 only 3 lines (incomplete stanza), stanza 7 is a short celebration. Partial but present. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count ≥8: Coinages include Reglet, Furnitree, chair-legs (compound?), cupboard giants, Ironjaw, spanner-sword, sniffling, gurgled (arguably standard English), uffish repeated, snicker-snack (canonical), galumphing (canonical), brilliant (standard word), gyrate (standard word), prance (standard word). Count distinct invented coinages: Reglet, Furnitree, Ironjaw, spanner-sword, chair-legs (compound?), cupboard giants (compound? plural?), underwood (controversial, more a real word), sniffling (standard English), gurgled (standard English). So weak in coinages, maybe 4-5 distinct coined words at best. Below 8. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza should contain at least 1 coinage. Checking each stanza: 1st with Reglet, Furnitree, chair-legs, cupboard giants (coinages present). 2nd with Reglet, Ironjaw (coinages). 3rd “spanner-sword” coinage present. 4th “Reglet” repeated, “underwood” may or may not be coined, “sniffling” and “gurgled” standard English though sound mimetic; ambiguous but probably no coinage per stanza in some of last stanzas. Stanza 5: “blade” and “snicker-snack” canonical, no new coinage. Stanza 6: chortled (standard), “beamish” missing (only canonical in original, but not here). No coinage. Stanza 7 and 8: no coinages or only standard words. So not all stanzas have coinage. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature named and central to action (non-canonical and not Jabberwock): Reglet is named and central; yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia ≥2 bursts: “snicker-snack!” is canonical; “sniffling” and “gurgled” are mimetic but less onomatopoeic bursts. Only one clear onomatopoeic burst “snicker-snack!” present, no other burst or exclamation like “Pop!”, “Hiss!”. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in minimum 2 stanzas: “Furnitree grows tall,” “chair-legs twisted in delight,” some internal consonant repetition but weak. “Beware the Reglet’s crafty claws!” - clear alliteration “crafty claws.” “Spanner-sword” compound repeats s+ sounds. At least two stanzas with clear alliteration – yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Early warning/admonition (stanza2), preparation (stanza3), encounter (stanza4), slaying (stanza5), return/celebration (stanza6-7). The order is canonical. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: No exact canonical lines from Lewis Carroll are used; words are changed. “snicker-snack” and “galumphing” are canonical words but standard vocabulary usage only. No verbatim line matches. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget ≤8 tokens: Canonical tokens used: “manxome” (stanza3), “uffish” (stanza4), “snicker-snack” (stanza5), “galumphing” (stanza5), and “beamish” (stanza6) — but “beamish” appears as “bright” is used instead. “Manxome” and “uffish” appear. So 3-4 canonical tokens used. Under threshold. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines ~8-9 syllables, shorter lines ~5-7 syllables per stanza. Check stanza1: 1st line 7 syll. (“In wondrous lands of Reglet bright”) slightly short; 2nd line “Where Furnitree grows tall,” 5 syll; 3rd line 7; 4th line 5. The pattern is inconsistent/stretched. Some stanzas have lines over 9 syllables or under 5 in longer/shorter positions, so syllable structure is loose and not tight. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety (2,4 rhymes varied, no more than 2 repeats): rhyme repeats include “brawl” rhymes (stanza1 end), “draw/flush” (weak), “mien/screen” new rhyme, “flame/came” new rhyme, “snicker-snack” unique. Some reuse of rhyme endings but no exact repetition beyond twice. Probably yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard (no word overused >5x or >8% content words): “Reglet” is repeated but less than 5 times, no high overuse. No problematic lexical repetition. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety ≥4 roots, not dominated by suffixes: Only about 4-5 coinages total, with distinct roots (Reglet, Furnitree, Ironjaw, spanner-sword, chair-legs compound). No dominant suffix group. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem addresses a Reglet fight/adventure, clearly on topic with Jabberwocky narrative adapted. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Subtle subtext in heroic adventure and domestic/furniture metaphor; somewhat coherent motif of struggle against household menace, echoes original undertone. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}
