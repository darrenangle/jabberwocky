The poem should include a title and be about a suitcase.\n \n Steps:\n 1. Choose a title that sounds Carrollesque, perhaps with a hint of nonsense or portmanteau.\n 2. Use the rhythmic pattern: anapestic tetrameter (four anapestic feet per line, though variations are common). An anapest is two short/unstressed syllables followed by a long/stressed one (da-da-DA). Sometimes the first foot might be trochaic (DA-da) or iambic (da-DA) to start.\n 3. Invent some nonsense words that evoke the suitcase's adventures, moods, or contents.\n 4. Tell a miniature story about the suitcase: perhaps its journey, contents, or personification.\n 5. Include moments of danger or excitement as in \"Jabberwocky\", but with suitcasesque elements.\n\n Example structure from \"Jabberwocky\":\n - First stanza: sets the scene, often with a \"Twas\" and some whimsical setting.\n - Second stanza: warning by a parent figure (perhaps a traveling parent or the owner).\n - Third stanza: the protagonist (the suitcase) sets out.\n - Fourth stanza: the battle or adventure (with a suitcase antagonist?).\n - Fifth stanza: victory and return.\n - Sixth stanza: reunion and celebration.\n\n But we can adapt to the suitcase theme.\n\n Idea for the poem:\n - The suitcase is the hero, journeying through a fantastical version of travel.\n - The antagonist could be something like a \"Snatcher\" or \"Tumblebeast\" (nonsense names) that tries to steal luggage or cause mishaps.\n - The owner might be a \"Beamish boy\" (in Carroll's style) who is reunited with the suitcase.\n\n Title Idea: \"The Frumious Suitcase\"\n\n Poem Structure:\n - Stanza 1: Setting. Twas brillig in the travel-mart, and the slithy bags did glide...\n - Stanza 2: Warning. Beware the Snatchersnatch, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!\n - Stanza 3: The suitcase's journey. It left with hopes and ties aglow...\n - Stanza 4: The battle. It faced the Snatchersnatch! One, two! One, two!

All are quatrains, total 7 stanzas, which fits the 3–8 guideline.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter requires in at least 60% of quatrains alternating longer/shorter lines with at least 2 content words difference. Sample: lines alternate between ~9–10 syll and 5–7 syll mostly; for example, stanza 1 lines: 8/6/8/7 approximate; pattern fits; majority of stanzas maintain this meter pattern (7 total, ≥4 stanzas meet criteria). So yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme of lines 2 and 4: Most quatrains rhyme lines 2 and 4 with good or slant rhyme, avoiding AABB dominance. For example, stanza 2 rhymes catch/Shun (slant rhyme is weak but present), stanza 3 sought/thought (perfect rhyme), stanza 5 head/said (perfect rhyme), stanza 6 now/knot (half/slant rhyme), stanza 7 Callay/slain (harsh but off rhyme). This is >60% stanzas with (2,4) rhyme and no AABB. Yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition requires final stanza to echo opening in ≥2 content words or a clear refrain. The last stanza echoes \"Jabber-awl\" and similar phrasing, but does not repeat the first stanza content words. The phrase “O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!” is repeated matching canonical poem. The first stanza and last stanza do not share much content; no clear ring echo across poem ends. So, no.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition: 2nd stanza opens with \"Beware the Jabber-awl, my son!...\" which is a direct caution like canonical poem. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Protagonist preparation: 3rd stanza: \"He grabbed his vorpal sword in hand: Long time the manxome foe he sought— So strutted he by the Tumtum tree, And stood awhile in thought.\" Shows preparation with weapon, searching, and pausing to think. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: 4th stanza describes the Jabber-awl coming with \"eyes of flame,\" whiffling and burbling as it came. Clear meeting present. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: 5th stanza describes \"The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! He left it dead, and with its head,\" which is the slaying action. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: 5th stanza also notes \"He skipped along in victory's track,\" and 6th and 7th stanzas continue with victorious speech and joy. Return and celebration present. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: \"Jabber-awl,\" \"gyrate,\" \"twirl,\" \"whimsical whirls,\" \"frumious Bandersnatch\" (canonical), \"inky thought\" (not canonical), \"stride,\" \"heart's knot,\" maybe \"awl\" is coinage variant. Very few invented coinages besides slight coinage of \"Jabber-awl,\" and \"whimsical whirls\" as phrase. Total unique coinages fewer than 8. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Not every stanza contains any coinages; several stanzas mostly use existing canonical terms or English words. So no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creature/entity: Jabber-awl is named, non-canonical as \"awl\" is new suffix, creature is central. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"snicker-snack!\" present; \"whiffling,\" \"burbled\" from canonical onomatopoeic coinages; but only one active burst \"snicker-snack!\" present; no second clear onomatopoeic burst like \"pop!\" or \"hiss!\". No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: First stanza has clear alliteration: \"whisps of light,\" \"gyrate and twirl,\" \"dreaming trance,\" \"world confined,\" showing consonance and internal sounds; also stanza 4: \"whiffling through the tulgey wood\" canonical. So at least two stanzas with evident alliteration/consonance beyond incidental. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Tone: whimsical/mythic tone preserved, playful and mysterious with nonsense coinages and mythic quest framing. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines matched from canonical poem—for example, \"’Twas brillig\" is changed to \"’Twas lurk of night,\" \"Jabber-awl\" for Jabberwock, but some canonical lines reused with minor changes (eg line 2 of stanza 2 \"Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun The frumious Bandersnatch!\" is reused verbatim). Since at least one line matches exactly \"Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun The frumious Bandersnatch!\" from canonical poem, no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens usage: Besides reuse of canonical tokens like \"Jabber,\" \"vorpal,\" \"manxome,\" \"Tumtum,\" \"Jubjub,\" \"Bandersnatch,\" \"whiffling,\" \"burbled,\" \"snicker-snack,\" and \"frumious,\" the total distinct canonical tokens appear to be ≤8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines ~8–9 syllables, shorter lines ~5–7. Sampling line 1 first stanza: \"'Twas lurk of night, (4) and the wisps (4) of light (2) = ~10 syll, line 2: Did gyrate and twirl in mirth (7 syll); mostly close to 8/6 pattern across stanzas; yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety within (2,4) rhymes over 7 stanzas: (catch/shun) slant rhyme; (sought/thought) perfect rhyme; (head/said) rhyme; (now/knot) slant rhyme; (Callay/slain) slant rhyme. No repetition of exact rhyme end words more than twice; yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No obvious overuse of particular content words beyond 5 times or 8% ratio; \"Jabber-awl\" used multiple times but fits within normal repetition; no overuse detected. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Only a few coinages: 'Jabber-awl' as a variant of canonical name; no evidence of 4 distinct coinage roots.
