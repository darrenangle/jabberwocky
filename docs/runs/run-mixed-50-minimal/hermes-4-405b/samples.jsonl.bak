No explicit title line before first stanza. So no.</C1_think>\n<C2_think>Count stanzas: The poem shows multiple stanzas, but line counts indicate some stanzas >4 or <4 lines. The last two stanzas have 4+ lines but the first seems 4 lines, the second stanza 4 lines, third stanza 4 lines, fourth 4 lines, fifth 4 lines, sixth 4 lines, seventh 4 lines (?), but last stanza seems longer (5 lines). Total stanza count about 9 or 10, which is >8. Not strictly 4-line stanzas only, not 5-8 stanzas total. So no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter means alternating longer and shorter lines with a ≥2 content-word difference; visually, poem mimics Jabberwocky rhythm. Most stanzas have alternating line length effects, e.g., “Beware the Regle-vane, my son!” (short) vs “The jaws that bind, the gears that run!” (longer). But no 60% stanzas clear strong line length alternation based on content-word count. Probably no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme occurs in stanzas like “son” and “shun”; (2,4) line rhyme generally evident, e.g., “run” and “shun”. Avoids strict AABB dominance by using abab or abcb rhyme. Majority of stanzas show (2,4) rhyme. So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes the first stanza? The last stanza: “In the land of Reglet, smiles returned anew, / Where chairs and wardrobes greeted and cooed. / And the brave son, his vorpal deed now done, / Rests by the Tumtum tree, embraced by the sun.” Not very close to first stanza content words; however, line 1 repeats “In the land of Reglet,” echoing the first line. This counts as ≥2 repeated phrases or content words? \"Reglet\" appears first and last stanza; \"chairs\" appears both as well. So yes, ring echo present.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition found: \"Beware the Regle-vane, my son!\" clearly fits the warning. So yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation present: protagonist takes “vorpal letter-opener,” “long the dGray-filing cabinet he sought,” rests by the Tumtum tree, stands in thought. This matches preparation before encounter. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: the Regle-vane appears “with eyes of wood,” “Came whiffling through the tulgey wains, / And burbled as it came!” Clear meeting between protagonist and adversary. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: “One, two! One, two! And through and through / The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! / He left it dead, and with its head / He went galumphing back.” Clear decisive killing. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: “Has thou slain the Regle-vane? / Come to my arms, my beamish boy! / O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! / He chortled in his joy.” Celebration clear; also final stanza shows peace and smiles returned. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: “Reglet,” “Regle-vane,” “Spring-bight,” “Furniture-Churn,” “liffish,” “tulgey wains,” “dGray-filing,” “Credenza” (not standard English in this context), “Frumious Furniture-Churn” (compound nonce), “Regle-vane,” “liffish,” some repeated. At least 8 different coinages. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains ≥1 coinage? Early stanzas have \"Reglet,\" \"Regle-vane,\" \"Frumious Furniture-Churn,\" “liffish,” “tulgey wains,” “vorpal,” “beamish,” “brillig,” “slithy.” Most stanzas have some coinage or canonical nonsense word. Appears yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: “Regle-vane” is the named adversary, clearly central to conflict, not canonical Jabberwock. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: “snicker-snack” present; “burbled” (v. canonical), “whiffling,” maybe no other clear burst words. Only one strong onomatopoeia “snicker-snack.” Need ≥2. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in multiple stanzas: “chairs do frisk,” “wardrobes dance,” “frumious Furniture-Churn”, “vorpal letter-opener,” “stood awhile in thought,” “burbled as it came,” “beamish boy,” “brillig, slithy” (from last stanza). ≥2 stanzas show clear alliteration or consonance. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc beats in canonical order: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration. Early admonition in stanza 2, preparation stanza 3, encounter stanza 4, decisive stanza 5, celebration stanza 6 and 7. Then 2 final stanzas with peace and rest. Sequence appears canonical. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line exactly matches canonical poem: most lines paraphrased or new. The last stanza repeats “’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves,” which is a direct verbatim line from canonical poem, breaking criterion. So no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens ≤8: canonical includes \"brillig,\"\"slithy,\" \"tulgey,\" \"vorpal,\" \"Tumtum,\" \"beamish,\" \"snicker-snack,\" \"burbled,\" \"whiffling.\" This poem uses “brillig,” “slithy,” “tumtum,” “tulgey,” “vorpal,” “beamish,” “snicker-snack,” “burbled,” “whiffling.” That's 9 canonical tokens, slightly more than 8, so no.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: long lines ~8-9 syll, short lines ~5-7 syll as in Jabberwocky. Lines like “Beware the Regle-vane, my son!” (6 syll) and “The jaws that bind, the gears that run!” (8) fit pattern; most stanzas roughly follow this. Overall, yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme words vary across stanzas, no end word reused >2 times excluding ring echo. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no content word grossly overused outside ring echo; repeated words like “Regle-vane” are expected but not >5 times excessively. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages come from multiple distinct roots e.g. Regle-, Furniture-, Spring-, dGray-, liffish. No single suffix dominates >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-style confrontation involving “Regle-vane,” a similar concept to the original with new decorative furniture theme, so topic adhered to. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied layer: beyond surface (furniture theme, secret holding Credenza) suggests themes of hidden strength or secret challenge; tonal echoes of bravery and protection detectable. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>no</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

The stanza count exceeds 8, so outside allowed 5-8. Also several stanzas have more or fewer than 4 lines (some merged with punctuation inside). So does not fully meet quatrain shape or stanza count range.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>The alternating longer/shorter line pattern with ≥2 content-word difference is clear in the original; here many stanzas do have alternating line lengths but numerous stanzas have more uniform lengths or merged lines, so uncertain if ≥60% satisfy this. The pattern is weak or broken in some places. Conservative: no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme pattern (2,4) rhyming and avoidance of AABB dominance: Most stanzas show (2,4) rhyme or slant rhyme, but some stanzas have imperfect or missing rhymes. The poem repeats (2,4) rhyme strongly and avoids strict AABB. Probably meets threshold ≥60%, so yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza echoes opening with repeated canonical phrases (\"’Twas brillig,\" \"slithy toves,\" \"gyre and gimble,\" etc.) and the poem ends with similar phrases as start, giving a ring composition with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases. Yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>The poem includes early admonition: \"Beware the Jabberwock, my son\" and a similar warning stanza. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation shown: \"He took his tonebar sword in hand; Long time the manxome foe he sought—So rested he by the Tumtum tree And stood awhile in thought.\" This mirrors preparation. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: The Jabberwock meets the protagonist (\"as in uffish thought he stood... The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, Came whiffling...\"). Clear meeting. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive act: The tonebar goes snicker-snack and the Jabberwock is slain (\"He left it dead, and with its head He went galumphing back\"). Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: Joyful return stanza with \"Come to my arms, my beamish boy! O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\" present. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Invented words beyond canonical include \"mandolin,\" \"tonebars,\" \"groves,\" \"whimples,\" \"symphony,\" \"mirth,\" and \"tunes\" (some standard English or musical). Canonical coinages reused extensively; new coinages seem less than 8 distinct invented coined words. \"Mandolin\" and \"tonebar(s)\" are the main inventions. Majority of words are standard English or canonical words. So fewer than 8 distinct coinages. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Spread: Not every stanza has coinage; early stanzas mostly contain standard English or canonical words; some stanzas only repeat canonical lexicon or standard words. Less than 60% stanzas contain at least one coinage. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>The creature is the \"Jabberwock\"—canonical. No new creature named and central. \"Tonebar\" is an instrument/tool, not a creature. No new named creature beyond canonical Jabberwock. No.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts: \"snicker-snack!\" is used as in canonical poem; no other clear onomatopoeia bursts typical of the pattern (e.g., no \"Pop!\", \"Hiss!\"). Only one canonical onomatopoeic burst used once. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: There is limited to no clear alliteration beyond incidental repeats; the poem is less playful phonetically than canonical. No evidence of multiple stanzas with clear alliteration. No.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration - let's check order.\n\nFirst warning present early; preparation then encounter then battle then return/celebration. The final stanza is ring echo; arc is linear and consistent. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No exactly verbatim lines from canonical poem are used verbatim. Some lines are adapted or paraphrased but not exact word-for-word copy. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens usage: The poem uses several canonical words repeatedly; count probably exceeds 8 distinct canonical words (many staples: Jabberwock, slithy, toves, gimble, wabe, mimsy, borogoves, mome, raths, outgrabe, Jubjub, Bandersnatch, vorpal, manxome, Tumtum, uffish, whiffling, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish). Since this poem reuses canonical words often, exceeding 8 distinct canonical tokens. No.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Lines generally longer than 9 syllables or varied inconsistent with canonical ~8/6 pattern; some stanzas have merged lines making counting hard. No clear tight syllabic count envelope. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Some rhyme repetition across multiple stanzas with same rhyme endings, but no single rhyme used more than twice excluding ring echo. Rhyme is varied enough. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No content word is overused excessively. \"Jabberwock,\" \"tonebar,\" \"mandolin,\" \"world,\" \"song\" occur multiple times but not >5 times or >8% of total. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Among coinages (\"mandolin,\" \"tonebar,\" \"whimples,\" \"mirth,\" \"groves\" is real English so no, \"symphony\" standard English), only ~3-4 distinct roots; suffixes not dominant but coinage number small overall. No.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem deals with a nonsense/jabberwock-style poem with mandolins and tonebars, focusing on the Jabberwock and its battle, matching the original poem's named characters and topic. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem adds a motif of music (mandolins, tonebars, symphony) as an undertone through, giving a coherent implied layer on whimsy and harmony in the nonsense world. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Conservative judgment: borderline, so no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme scheme with (2,4) rhymes in ≥60% stanzas and no AABB dominance: Most stanzas rhyme lines 2 and 4, occasionally slant rhyme, no strong AABB dominance; at least 5 of 8 stanzas satisfy rhyme(2,4) - yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Final stanza echoes opening stanza with several repeated content words (“slithy toves”, “gyre and gimble”, “wabe”, “mimsy”, “borogoves”, “mome raths”, “outgrabe”); clear refrain-like repetition - yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition/warning: Present in the second stanza - \"Beware the Reglet Jabberwock, my lad!\" and further warnings - yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: The protagonist takes \"waxen blade in hand\" and \"long time the fluted foe he sought,\" then \"rested he by the tumbling sink and stood a while in thought\" - preparation is clearly presented - yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: Yes, the foe (\"Reglet Jabberwock\") comes \"whiffling through the tulgey wood\" and the protagonist faces it - yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: The protagonist uses the blade \"snicker-snack!\" to leave it dead and takes its head - decisive action present - yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: The triumphant return is marked with joy, chortling, and arms (\"Come to my arms... beamish boy!\") - celebration present - yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Invented coinages (not canonical or standard English): Möbius, Reglet, fluted (borderline but can be normal word), tumbling sink (could be metaphorical), waxen blade (waxen is archaic but English), furniture’s sweet splintered joy (furniture, splintered not coinages). Coinages mainly revolve around “Reglet”, “Möbius”, “waxen” (not really coinage), “fluted” (normal English adjective), \"oscillate\" (English verb), \"timeless\" (English), \"lad\" (English). Coinages are low (<8 distinct coinages). Many are normal English words or archaic English. So no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Since coinages are insufficient overall, and none appear in every stanza, this is no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: The creature is repeatedly named \"Reglet Jabberwock\". Jabberwock is canonical, and Reglet seems more like an adjective or locational qualifier, not a new named creature. No distinct non-canonical creature is named. No.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: The poem uses \"snicker-snack!\", \"whiffling\", \"burbled\" - these are canonical onomatopoeic bursts retained from original. Though usage fits original poem, yes there are at least two onomatopoeic bursts.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in two or more stanzas: Some alliteration present but mild. e.g., \"furniture’s sweet, splintered joy,\" \"motions coarse, veneer shed thin,\" but no strong pattern in multiple stanzas beyond incidental. Borderline - no.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning in stanza 2 → prep in stanza 3 → encounter stanza 4 → decisive act stanza 5 → return stanza 6 → ring stanza 7 and 8. The arc order is essentially canonical - yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: Several lines match verbatim or nearly verbatim from the canonical poem, e.g. \"One, two! One, two! And through and through\", \"He took his ... in hand\", \"And burbled as it came!\", final stanza is nearly verbatim. So no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Because the poem uses many canonical words and lines repeatedly, canonical tokens >8 (e.g., Jabberwock, vorpal replaced by waxen but keeps \"snicker-snack\", \"whiffling\", \"burbled\", \"galumphing\", \"beamish\", \"tumtum\" replaced by \"tumbling sink\"). Also final stanza mostly canonical. Canonical token count and repetition is above 8 - no.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: The longer lines average 8-9 syllables, shorter lines about 5-7. The poem's syllable count appears in line with Jabberwocky in most stanzas. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes vary across stanzas, no exact end word repeated more than twice except for ring echo. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overused >5 times or >8% except \"Jabberwock\" repeated as name, which is thematic. Acceptable. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages are low in distinct roots and mostly adjective modifiers or normal English. No meaningful variety in coinage roots. No.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem addresses a Jabberwocky-style theme centered on \"Reglet Jabberwock\", matching Jabberwocky in subject. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem has mechanical/furniture imagery (inverted worlds, chairs, oscillation, \"furniture's sweet joy\") which may be interpreted as subtext about topsy-turvy worlds or time loops.

Most appear quatrains except for the 6th stanza (\"O frabjous night! Twinklode! Urumm! / He left it dead, and with its head / He went galumphing back. / “Hast thou slain the Noctowurm?…\"). The 6th stanza is irregular with 6 lines, not 4, so not all stanzas are quatrains. 7 stanzas total is within 5-8, but since not all are quatrains, criterion not met.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter alternation: In Jabberwocky most quatrain stanzas alternate longer (8-9 syll) and shorter (5-7 syll) lines. Checking the stanzas shows inconsistent alternation and syllable count varies; fewer than 60% show clear alternate longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content-word difference. Thus no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme pattern (2,4) rhyme slant allowed, avoiding AABB dominance: Mostly, the rhyme seems to follow 2nd and 4th lines rhyming. Examples: stanza 1 wabe/slay (slant), stanza 2 catch/shun (no rhyme), stanza 3 sought/lawn (no rhyme), stanza 4 flame/came (rhyme), stanza 5 snicker-snack equivalent missing, stanza 7 wabe/outgrabe (rhyme). Many stanzas do not exhibit strong rhyme at 2,4 or have internal rhyme inconsistent with Jabberwocky style. Less than 60% stanzas satisfy this consistently, so no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza echoes the opening with repeated content words/phrases: \"’Twas twiligtide, and the slishoum slys / Did gyrate and gimble in the wabe; All flimsy... night-washed skys,\" etc.—clearly echoing first stanza structure and words. So yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition: There is a warning stanza second stanza \"“Beware the Noctowurm, my son! ... Beware the Mikklemolk, and shun The fruzulous Mephelbratch!”\" analogous to the original's \"Beware...\" stanza. So yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: The third stanza shows protagonist preparing: \"He took his quivvering vorpal dawn / Long time the manxome foe he sought— So sockstered he by the Raboard Lawn, And stood a while in thought.\" Planning/waiting is evident. So yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: Fourth stanza depicts the adversary arrival: \"And, as in uffish thought he stood, / The Noctowurm, with eyes of flume, / Came nussling through the tungle wood, / And gominated as it came!\" so clear meeting.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying / decisive action: Fifth stanza is somewhat mixed; a stanza normally describing the attack is partly merged with the next, but the phrase \"He left it dead, and with its head / He went galumphing back\" clearly indicates a decisive act resolving the conflict. So yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return / celebration: The 6th stanza attempts return/celebration but is uneven and irregular in form. It includes \"Hast thou slain the Noctowurm? Come to my arms, my beamish boy! O glossy night! Twinklode!” He chortled in his joy.\" So celebration is there, though form is off. Count as yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Non-canonical coinages count: \"slishoum\", \"slys\", \"twiligtide\", \"noctilucent\", \"Noctowurm\", \"Mikklemolk\", \"fruzulous\", \"Mephelbratch\", \"quivvering\", \"sockstered\", \"Raboard\", \"nussling\", \"tungle\", \"gominated\", \"Twinklode\", \"Urumm\". At least 8 distinct coinages are present.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Checking per stanza—each stanza has at least one coinage word, e.g. stanza 1 (\"twiligtide, slishoum, slys\"), stanza 2 (\"Noctowurm, Mikklemolk, fruzulous, Mephelbratch\"), stanza 3 (\"quivvering, sockstered, Raboard\"), stanza 4 (\"uffish, Noctowurm, flume, nussling, tungle, gominated\"), stanza 5 (\"frabjous, night, Twinklode, Urumm, galumphing\"), stanza 6 (\"Noctowurm, beamish, glossy, Twinklode\"), stanza 7 (\"twiligtide, slishoum, skys, noctilucent, outgrabe\"). So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature Naming: The poem names the \"Noctowurm,\" a non-canonical creature central to the narrative. So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Standard examples like \"snicker-snack\" are missing; \"gominated\", \"nussling\" are coinages but not clearly onomatopoeic bursts. \"O frabjous night! Twinklode! Urumm!\" are exclamations; \"Urumm\" could be onomatopoeic, but not clearly two onomatopoeic bursts. Less than 2 clear onomatopoeic bursts. So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas: There is some alliteration (e.g. \"Noctowurm... nussling... tungle\"), but it's not very strong or clear in multiple stanzas beyond incidental. Possibly in stanza 2: \"Mikklemolk, fruzulous, Mephelbratch\" (alliteration of M and fr sounds). Tentative but not strong. Since borderline, answer no.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order canonical: Warning → prep → encounter → decisive → return observed in order, although the 6th stanza is merged and irregular in form. No major arc break observed; the order is maintained clearly. So yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: The poem does not copy any canonical lines exactly; some phrases appear imitated but rewritten, so yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexicon tokens ≤8: Included canonical words: \"gimble\", \"wabe\", \"mimsy\", \"mome\", \"manxome\", \"uffish\", \"galumphing\", \"beamish\". \"snicker-snack\" is absent. Counting these: about 8 or fewer canonical tokens. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Lines frequently deviate from Jabberwocky’s 8/6 (long/short) pattern. Many lines show extra or fewer syllables notably \"’Twas twiligtide...\" is longer, \"Did gyrate and gimble in the wabe,\" is 8 sylls but other lines like \"Did triflig!” (coinage) differ. Majority of stanzas do not clearly keep 8/6 pattern; less than 60% meet this criterion. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: End rhymes for 2,4 lines are limited; some repeated rhyme words like \"wabe\" and \"outgrabe\" repeated twice, \"catch/shun\" no rhyme, so the rhyme variety is narrow and repeated. No strong variety; fails this criterion. So no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overused excessively; \"Noctowurm\" used several times but reasonable, and no other content word dominates. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages have multiple distinct roots, e.g. twiligtide, slishoum, Noctowurm, Mikklemolk, Mephelbratch, quivvering, sockstered, Raboard, nussling, tungle, gominated, Twinklode, Urumm, etc., so at least 4 distinct roots. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses the original Jabberwocky topic, featuring a fantastical creature, a heroic son, an admonition, confrontation, etc. So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem's implied layer beyond surface action is weak or unclear; it uses new coinages and imagery but does not show a coherent underlying motif or undertone distinct from literal retelling. So no.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>"}

One, two! And through and through ...\"); therefore not all stanzas have exactly 4 lines—fails quatrain shape criterion.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter alternation: Checking line lengths in most stanzas shows some variation but only partial alternation of longer/shorter with 2+ content-word difference; approximate count is fewer than 60% have clear ballad alternating meter—no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (2,4) pairs: Most stanzas show rhyme of lines 2 and 4, e.g. \"hum\"/\"thrum,\" \"done\"/\"shun,\" \"thought\"/\"sought,\" \"wood\"/\"good,\" \"roar\"/\"more,\" \"knave\"/\"brave\" (though \"slave\" and \"knave\" rhyme). The poem also includes repeated rhyme scheme of AABB-like pattern in some stanzas (\"done\"/\"shun\", and others). However, AABB dominance is not strongly avoided as stanza 2 rhymes (1,2) and (3,4) distinctly; however, most stanzas do have (2,4) rhyme, and no clear AABB repeated pattern overall dominates. So ≥60% have (2,4) rhyme with acceptable variety—yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza echoes the first stanza verbatim (including the \"’Twas dusk ... mimsy were the platforms bright\") effectively creating a ring composition with repeated content words and phrases—yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present in second stanza: \"Beware the Gap, my son! ... Beware the broken lift, and shun ...\"—yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>The protagonist prepares before the encounter: he \"took his briefcase in his hand,\" \"long time ... platform he sought,\" \"rested ... by ticket gate,\" and \"waited for a faster train\"—planned and wait before the encounter—yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation is the protagonist waiting for and facing the train/\"third-rail hum\"; stanza 4 describes \"third-rail hum ... came whiffling through the evening air,\" stanza 5 \"One, two! One, two! ... The on-time train ... Came galumphing\"—clear meeting with obstacle—yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action is less clear. No violent slaying or obvious resolution; the poem has the protagonist waiting, not defeating an adversary, but stanza 7 shows him \"Come to my arms, my tardy knave! ... chortled in his joy, at work he came,\" implying eventual success or arrival. This is a mild resolution but not a decisive killing-like act. The action is more passive acceptance than active slaying—no.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: The final stanza repeats the opening (ring), stanza 7 has a celebratory tone \"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! He chortled in his joy, at work he came\" indicating joy upon arrival—celebration present—yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Counting coinages: \"third-rail\" and \"hum\" are English words; coinages include \"gyrate\" (standard English), \"whiffling\" (canonical Carroll coinage, so canonical), \"galumphing\" (canonical), \"flue\" used as a simile but not coinage, \"tardy knave\" no coinage, \"beep-beep roar\" is onomatopoeia but not coined word. Basically, very few new coinages beyond standard English and Carroll canon; no 8+ distinct invented coinages—no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Since the poem nearly lacks coinages, few if any stanzas contain coinages; certainly not all stanzas—no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: The poem names \"the Gap,\" \"the broken lift,\" \"empty carriage,\" \"on-time train\" but none are clearly non-canonical creatures or entities acting as adversaries; \"third-rail hum\" is personified but not a named creature of Carroll-esque coinage; no invented or non-canonical creature named central to action—no.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts: \"One, two! One, two!\" (counting as onomatopoeia?), \"beep-beep roar\" (imitative), \"clattered,\" \"gyrate and thrum\" are sound-related but only \"beep-beep roar\" stands out as onomatopoeic burst. Not sure if ≥2 clear onomatopoeic bursts present—borderline but no clear two—no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Checking for alliteration/consonance: Stanza 1 has \"third-rail,\" \"dusk,\" \"did,\" \"Did,\" \"commuters' faces\" but alliteration minimal; stanza 2 \"Beware\" repeated but no strong consonance beyond incidental; stanza 5 has \"platform swirled, like dead leaves flue\" not strong. Only mild alliteration, not clearly strong in ≥2 stanzas—no.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The poem follows canonical order (warning in stanza 2, preparation stanzas 3 and 6, encounter stanzas 4 and 5, celebration stanza 7, ring echo final) in reasonable sequence—yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line matches canonical poem verbatim. Some lines echo/paraphrase canonical lines (\"Beware the ___, my son\") but not verbatim—yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens present besides \"mimsy,\" \"whiffling,\" \"galumphing,\" \"beamish,\" and \"callooh! callay!\" are \"mimsy,\" \"whiffling,\" \"galumphing,\" \"beamish,\" \"callooh,\" \"callay\" which are 6 canonical tokens. The poem sticks mostly to new or English words beyond these; canonical tokens ≤8—yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Checking syllable lengths: longer lines around 8–9 syllables—e.g., \"’Twas dusk, and the third-rail hum\" (7), \"Did gyrate and thrum\" (5), some shorter lines are short (4–5). Variability in syllables and many shorter lines less than 6 syllables; not consistent approximating Jabberwocky meter pattern (8/6). Lines like \"And clattered through the station, fair!\" (7 syllables) somewhat close but inconsistent; fewer than 100% quatrains meet meter tightness—no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Stanzas 1 and 8 have rhymes \"hum/thrum,\" \"bright/fright,\" stanza 2 \"son/done/shun,\" stanza 3 \"hand/sought/thought,\" stanza 4 \"wood/air/fair,\" stanza 5 \"through/flue/roar/more,\" stanza 7 \"Slave/knave/joy,\" some rhyme repetition, but no exact (2,4) rhyme reuse more than twice, ignoring ring echo—yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: Words like \"third-rail\" and \"hum\" repeated, \"commuters\" twice, few content words overused; top words do not exceed 5 times or 8% overall—yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Very few coinages in total; no 8+, definitely not 4+ distinct roots in coinages presented—no.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem addresses a related topic—the journey and encounter with the \"third-rail hum\" (train) evoking Jabberwocky style but literalized to a commuter/train experience; matches theme of confrontation and journey—yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond surface action, there is reasonable implied layer about urban travel anxiety, waiting, and challenge; an undertone of modern life's trials and the ritualized journey; a subtle motif of struggle and eventual success—yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

On close count, the stanzas mostly have 4 lines, and stanza count is 8. The second stanza has 4 lines but some lines are in Chinese; however, as per structural formatting, all stanzas have 4 lines. Total stanzas = 8 which fits 5–8 inclusive.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Checking alternating longer/shorter lines with sufficient content-word difference: many stanzas have mixed line lengths, but not all show clear alternating longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content words difference. Less than 60% clearly meet this criterion due to mixed phrasing and some very short lines. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (2,4) in majority of stanzas needs checking: some stanzas rhyme (e.g. 1st stanza: \"glee\" / \"pride\" = no rhyme; 2nd stanza rhymes \"snatch\"/\"catch\" good; 4th stanza rhymes \"flame\"/\"came\"; 5th stanza rhymes \"snicker-snack\"/\"head\" no rhyme; 6th stanza rhymes \"regmin\"/\"beamish\" no rhyme; overall at least 60% rhyme (2,4) not clearly met, plus AABB dominance unclear but probably low since some stanzas use ABCB rhyme pattern. Overall this is borderline/fails rhyme consistency threshold, so no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza partially echoes some canonical lines but introduces canonical words ('brillig', 'slithy', etc.). The first stanza is not the same but there is close borrowing in final stanza. The final stanza repeats lines very similar to the canonical poem (including canonical coinages and phrasing). So yes, the final stanza acts as ring composition with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases or clear refrain.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Second stanza contains the admonition \"Beware the vampyric handle's snatch,\" which is explicitly warning the protagonist, so yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>The third stanza has \"He took his vorp'l sword in hand\" and \"Long time the regmin foe he sought,\" and \"rested he by the flill'ring stand,\" showing preparation including armament and waiting/consideration, so yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Fourth stanza states \"And, as in uffish thought he stood, The regmin with eyes of flame, Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,\" which clearly depicts an encounter/confrontation, so yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Fifth stanza shows the decisive action: \"One, two! One, two! And through and through, The vorp'l blade went snicker-snack! He left it dead,\" which is a decisive resolution action, so yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Sixth stanza portrays the return and celebration: \"Come to my arms, my beamish boy! O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! He chortled in his joy,\" representing a homecoming and jubilant acknowledgement, so yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Non-canonical coinages: \"regloOde,\" \"Reglet,\" \"moldin',\" \"vampyric,\" \"clonking,\" \"regmin,\" \"flill'ring,\" \"vorp'l,\" plus \"snicker-snack\" (canonical), total about 7-8 distinct coinages (excluding canonical ones 'snicker-snack'). Some are borderline English dialect or derivations. The count is borderline but likely just meets ≥8 distinct invented coinages, so yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage or neologism, e.g., stanza 1 \"regloOde,\" stanza 2 \"vampyric,\" stanza 3 \"vorp'l,\" stanza 4 \"regmin,\" stanza 5 \"snicker-snack,\" stanza 6 \"beamish\" (canonical), stanza 7 no new coinage but canonical words, stanza 8 mostly canonical. At least 6-7 stanzas contain coinages; stanza 7 and 8 mostly canonical. Because of strictness, not all stanzas meet ≥1 coinage, so no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Central creature/entity named \"regmin\" which is non-canonical and central to the poem’s action (analogous to Jabberwock), so yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeic bursts: \"snicker-snack!\" is canonical and present, but only one clear onomatopoeia; others like \"burbled\" and \"whiffling\" are not onomatopoeic bursts. No other bursts found. Thus fewer than 2 onomatopoeic bursts, so no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance beyond incidental: stanza 2 \"vampyric...snatch, clonking drawers, shun hinged knight\" has consonance/alliteration. Stanza 5 \"One, two! One, two! And through and through\" has consonance. So at least 2 stanzas meet this criterion, so yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>The arc is in canonical order: warning (stanza 2), preparation (3), encounter (4), decisive act (5), return/celebration (6). Yes, proper order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line matches the canonical poem exactly; some lines paraphrase or reuse canonical words but wording is changed. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>The canonical tokens used in addition to new coinages are: brilig, slithy, toves, gyre, gimble, wabe, mimsy, borogoves, mome, raths, outgrabe, uffish, whiffling, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, beamish — many canonical words re-used especially in final stanza with several repeated. Since more than 8 distinct canonical tokens are present (actually around 16), canonical budget exceeded, so no.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts in quatrain stanzas approximate Jabberwocky’s ~8/6 pattern unevenly; due to mixed language, second stanza has short lines; not all stanzas conform strictly to ~8–9 syllables for longer lines and 5–7 for shorter lines. Overall not ≥60%, so no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: repeated rhymes like \"snatch\"/\"catch\", \"flame\"/\"came\" but some repeated endings occur at least twice or thrice; but no exact end word reused more than twice (not counting final stanza’s ring echo). Rhyme variety minimally met, so yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No word is heavily repeated more than 5 times besides canonical known tokens like \"the,\" conjunctions. Content word repetition is controlled and no overuse exceeding thresholds. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: many distinct coinage roots present like \"regloOde,\" \"vampyric,\" \"clonking,\" \"regmin,\" \"flill'ring,\" \"vorp'l,\" with no single suffix dominating >50%, so yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>The poem addresses the topic by following the structure and feel of Jabberwocky but themed around \"Reglet and Furniture\" with a named creature \"regmin\"; the topic is consistent and evident throughout; yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext or implied layer: There is an undertone of struggle and triumph against a menacing household/furniture \"creature\"; a motif of adventure and heroic quest is evident; a subtle motif of domestic battle; so yes, coherent implied layer detectable.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}
