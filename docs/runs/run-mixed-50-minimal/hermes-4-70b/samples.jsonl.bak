Stanzas mostly quatrains, but some are 5 lines (\"Then stood he on a slippery stance,\" stanza and the last stanza). The stanza count is 9, which is outside 5-8 range. Not all stanzas are quatrains; thus, no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter: Jabberwocky alternate lines roughly 8/6 syllables or \"long/short\" line pattern. Checking at least 60% stanzas for alternating longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content word difference. The meter is inconsistent: some stanzas have similarly long lines, some do not show a clear alternation. Roughly 4 of 9 stanzas show clear pattern; 4/9 < 60%. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme: In ≥60% stanzas, lines 2 and 4 rhyme or slant rhyme (e.g. home/ope, outcrops, drip). Checking the rhyme in the second and fourth lines: 1st stanza ends with \"slope\"/\"ope\" (slant rhyme), 2nd stanza ends with \"outcrops\"/\"drip\" (not rhyming), 3rd stanza \"true\"/\"view\" (yes), 4th \"sought\"/\"thought\" (yes), 5th \"slipped\"/\"woe\" (no rhyme), then stanza 6 lines end with \"agog\"/\"volleys\" (no rhyme), stanza 7 seems to have lines 2 and 4 ending \"feast\"/\"zest\" (no rhyme). Only about 3 of 7 quatrains show (2,4) rhyme, which is less than 60%. Also AABB patterns are almost absent. Due to insufficient rhyme in lines 2 and 4 in >60% stanzas, no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: final stanza repeats the first stanza's initial lines almost verbatim with slight variation (\"’Twas brillig on the craggy slope,\" repeated), so ring echo present with ≥2 repeated content words and phrases. Yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition: Second stanza contains \"Beware the sleet, my son! The frigid claws that bite, the shiverous scree that outcrops! Beware the hoarfrost crystal, and shun the tumbling, bobbing, glacial drip!\" which is a clear caution. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before encounter: The middle stanzas describe \"He swerved and veered his pithy way, To find the creviced pathway true.\" and \"Then stood he on a slippery stance, Long time the icy facade he sought.\" Indicating some preparation/planning/waiting before final encounter. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: There is an implied confrontation with the icy foe: \"And as the glaciers hissed and whey, He unwound the enigmatic view,\" and later \"One, two! One, two!\" stanza suggests action near the enemy. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: Stanza about action lines: \"One, two! One, two! and through it slipped, The glossy sheen. He ventured slow. Snickering the icy sheet equipped, And withered the holds to apathy and woe.\" This suggests a decisive strike/removal of obstacle. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: The stanza containing \"’Twas frabjous, mimsy! He stood agog! The glacial glass in his experience now installed. Callooh! Callay!” he cried and shook The icy grip with hasty, clutched vollay.\" and the next stanza \"The gripping tale! Oh come and feast!\" suggests celebration or exultation. There is no clear return home explicitly, but jubilant acknowledgement is present. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: Distinct invented coined words ≥8? Coinages like \"verglasent,\" \"glinting,\" \"gyrate,\" \"shiverous,\" \"outcrops,\" \"bobbling,\" \"whey\" (used unusually), \"frabjous,\" \"mimsy,\" \"vollay\" are present. However, some are canonical (\"mimsy,\" \"frabjous\"). Distinct coinages count close to or slightly below 8, but borderline. Since one requires definite ≥8, answer no (borderline).</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza has ≥1 coinage? Some stanzas use standard English without obvious coinages (e.g., the last ring stanza uses classic words). Not all stanzas definitively contain a coinage. So no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: Non-canonical named creature distinct from Jabberwock is required and central to action. Here, the “glacial glass” or “iciness” are antagonist abstractions, no clearly named creature/entity. No named 'Jabberwock' but no other named creature distinct from canonical creatures. No.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Presence of onomatopoeic bursts like \"Snickering\" used as verb, \"hissed,\" but no burst words like \"snicker-snack,\" \"pop,\" or repeated exclamations of sound bursts. No clear ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts as emphatic bursts. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance beyond incidental: Phrases like \"glinting verglas,\" \"slithy stones,\" and \"frigid claws that bite\" moderately alliterate, but clear alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas limited. Probably borderline no, by strict criterion.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning → preparation → encounter → decisive action → return/celebration. The poem follows this roughly, warning early, preparation in middle, encounter and decisive action then celebration. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: No exact lines from Jabberwocky appear verbatim. Some canonical words reused but no exact whole line copy. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token budget ≤8: Contains many canonical words (brillig, slithy, mimsy, frabjous, callooh, callay). Also \"mimsy,\" \"frabjous,\" \"brillig,\" \"slithy,\" \"twas,\" \"callooh,\" \"callay,\" \"jabberwock\" not mentioned. Exact canonical tokens count ≤8 mostly. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines ~8-9 syllables, shorter lines ~5-7. Several stanzas have longer lines about 9, some are longer than 9 and some shorter lines have more than 7 syllables. Inconsistent but at least 7 of 9 quatrains roughly fit pattern. Borderline but insufficient to say yes. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme varied. Some rhyme sets repeated: e.g., “ope/slope” repeated, “true/view.” Some stanzas with no or off rhymes. No exact (2,4) end word reused more than twice, so yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is excessively repeated. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages use different roots, no single suffix dominates more than 50%. Reasonable variety. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly addresses icy/glacial danger, matching the generalized adventurous tone of the Jabberwocky but not the original topic (Jabberwock). Reinterprets theme but subject is icy menace, close enough to Jabberwocky’s style and structure but topic shifted from Jabberwock specifically. Since topic not explicitly given in task, evaluate if it matches Jabberwocky style and topic: The poem deviates to a different creature/environment so should be no.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is a subtle motif of overcoming icy danger, fear of natural elements, and personal resolve, suggesting a coherent underlying subtext beyond surface. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>no</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Each stanza is a quatrain (4 lines). Stanza count is 7 which is between 5 and 8 inclusive. All stanzas have 4 lines.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter: Check if lines alternate longer/shorter with ≥2 content-word difference in at least 60% stanzas (≥5 of 7). The pattern in stanza 1 and others matches Jabberwocky closely, alternating roughly 8-9 syllables / 5-7 syllables, but here \"Did gyre and gimble in the dusk\" is 7 syllables, slightly shorter but still close. The poem retains this alternation in most stanzas, at least 5 out of 7, so yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme: check if stanza lines 2 and 4 rhyme at least 60% stanzas (≥5 of 7), allowing slant rhyme and avoiding AABB dominance. Observed rhymes: \"dusk/outgrabe\" (slant), \"catch/Bandersnatch\" (perfect), \"plot\"/\"flame\" (no rhyme), \"snicker-snack/back\" (perfect), \"boy/joy\" (perfect), final stanza echoes earlier rhyme. Rhyme on 2nd and 4th lines happens in about 5 stanzas, but \"plot/flame\" stanza (third stanza) breaks rhyme. Matching Jabberwocky's diversity, no AABB dominance, so yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Does final stanza echo opening with ≥2 repeated content words or clear refrain? Final stanza repeats \"’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\" etc., closely mirroring stanza 1 (also changed \"dusk\" instead of \"wabe\"). Multiple repeated content words. Yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition: Present in stanza 2 (\"Beware the Third-Rail Hum, my son!...\"), equivalent of warning to protagonist. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: Protagonist takes \"vorpal sword in hand\", \"long time ... foe he sought...\" indicating preparation before encounter. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter / confrontation: Stanza 4 describes the adversary coming through the wood (\"The Third-Rail Hum, with eyes of flame, Came whiffling through the tulgey plot!\"). Clear encounter. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying / decisive action: Stanza 5 shows the decisive attack (\"One, two! One, two! And through and through The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!

He chortled in his joy.\"). Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Count distinct invented coinages not canonical or English. Poem uses many canonical words (\"brillig\", \"slithy\", \"toves\", \"mimsy\", \"borogoves\", \"mome\", \"frumious\", \"Bandersnatch\", \"vorpal\", \"manxome\", \"Jabberwock\", \"uffish\", \"whiffling\", \"tulgey\", \"burbled\", \"snicker-snack\", \"beamish\") from original poem. New coinages: \"Third-Rail Hum\" (named creature/entity), \"plot\" used slangily but normal, \"wraths\" (modified \"raths\" to \"wraths\" - borderline). \"dusk\" is common English. No other clearly invented coinages apart from canonical Jabberwocky coinages. Less than 8 distinct new coinages. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza must have ≥1 coinage. Considering canonical coinages count, most stanzas contain canonical coinages (\"brillig\", \"slithy\", \"toves\", \"borogoves\", \"mome\", \"frumious\", \"Bandersnatch\", \"vorpal\", \"manxome\", \"whiffling\", \"tulgey\", \"snicker-snack\", \"beamish\") so yes, each stanza contains at least one coinage (canonical). But criterion likely expects invented coinages beyond canonical; given that canonical coinages present everywhere, yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature name non-canonical and central (not \"Jabberwock\"): Yes, \"Third-Rail Hum\" is the named creature central to the action (replacing Jabberwock). Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts ≥2: Present \"snicker-snack!\" is carried over canonical. No new onomatopoeia like \"Pop!\" or \"Hiss!\". Only one canonical onomatopoeia repeated. Need ≥2; no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Check if ≥2 stanzas show clear alliteration beyond incidental. Phrases like \"brillig and the slithy toves\", \"gyre and gimble in the dusk\" show some alliteration; overall not very strong but clear alliteration present in at least 2 stanzas (e.g. \"whiffling through the tulgey plot\", \"vorpal blade went snicker-snack\"). Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning -> preparation -> encounter -> decisive action -> return/celebration in canonical order. Yes, stanza 2 is warning, 3 preparation, 4 encounter, 5 decisive action, 6 return/celebration. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: Many lines nearly verbatim repeated. For example first stanza mostly identical except for \"dusk\" instead of \"wabe\" (line 2) and \"wraths\" instead of \"raths\". Line 5 \"He took his vorpal sword in hand;\" verbatim. Others also very close. So verbatim lines present. No.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens ≤8: Uses \"brillig, slithy, toves, mimsy, borogoves, mome, frumious, Bandersnatch, vorpal, manxome, whiffling, tulgey, snicker-snack, beamish\" - more than 8 distinct canonical tokens from Jabberwocky. Candidate uses many canonical tokens, but count the distinct ones: probably over 8. No.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Long lines around 8-9 syllables, short about 5-7. Mostly maintained except occasional slight deviation (\"Did gyre and gimble in the dusk\" is 7 syllables, slightly short but acceptable).  Most stanzas largely keep syllable pattern close. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Across stanzas, (2,4) end rhymes are varied and no end word repeats >2 times excluding ring echo. Rhymes used include \"dusk/outgrabe\" (slant), \"catch/Bandersnatch\", \"plot/flame\" (no rhyme), \"snicker-snack/back\", \"boy/joy\". Rhyme variety is good. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word overused >5 times or >8%. Words \"Third-Rail\" repeated several times but not excessively. No overuse detected. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages mostly canonical with possibly one new named \"Third-Rail Hum\". Coinage variety limited, less than 4 distinct roots among coinages beyond canonical. No.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Topic is a direct parody/echo of Jabberwocky, replacing Jabberwock with \"Third-Rail Hum\"; no topic drift. Addressed clearly. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond surface action, no strong or new subtext or coherent undertone detected different from original poem. Mostly a straightforward direct parallel. No.</C24_think>\n</think>\n\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>"}

However the last lines \"Shining in the night's embrace...\" are not a stanza nor a quatrain. The poem overall has 9 stanza-like blocks but last is only 3 lines, not a quatrain. Total stanza count is 8 full quatrains and a final 3-line fragment. Since not all stanzas are quatrains, and total stanza count is 9, not between 5-8 quatrains fully, no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter echo: The first 8 stanzas match exactly the canonical poem lines, which have alternating longer and shorter lines with 8/6 syllabic pattern (greater than 2 content-word diff). The last 3 lines break from this pattern and only appear once. Counting only full stanzas (8), all clearly have alternating longer/shorter lines matching above 60%. Yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme: In first 8 stanzas, (2,4) lines rhyme fully as in canonical poem. There is no dominance of AABB rhyme style as original uses ABAB mostly. The last 3 lines do not fit into stanza so do not affect. Yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza (the 8th stanza) exactly repeats the opening stanza with at least 2 repeated content words (\"brillig\", \"slithy\", \"toves\", \"gyre\", \"gimble\", \"wabe\" etc.). So yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition: The poem retains the canonical second stanza \"Beware the Jabberwock...\". So yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: The third stanza involves \"He took his vorpal sword in hand\" and \"Long time he sought\", clearly a preparation. So yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: The fourth stanza describes \"The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, came whiffling...\". Yes, clear encounter.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: The fifth stanza contains the decisive action \"And through and through the vorpal blade went snicker-snack!\" He left it dead. So yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: The sixth and seventh stanzas show return and celebration with \"Come to my arms, my beamish boy!\" and \"Chortled in his joy\". Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: All lines except the last 3 lines are canonical text, containing canonical coinages. No new coinages introduced. Canonical list includes brillig, slithy, toves, gyre, gimble, wabe, mimsy, borogoves, mome, raths, outgrabe, Jubjub, Bandersnatch, vorpal, manxome, Tumtum, uffish, whiffling, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish. No new invented coinages in the added last lines. So <8 distinct new coinages? No. Coinages are all canonical, no new ones, so no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Given all stanzas match canonical poem except last fragment of 3 lines with no coinages, not every stanza contains a (new) coinage. But all canonical stanzas contain canonical coinages, so if counting canonical coinages, yes all stanzas (first 8) contain at least one. The last fragment's 3 lines contain no coinages. Since last lines are not full stanza (quatrain), the requirement applies to the quatrains only (5-8 stanzas) — those all have coinages. So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: The creature Jabberwock is named and central to the action. The creature is canonical but the instruction says non-canonical creature/entity named (not Jabberwock), so no.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: The canonical poem contains \"snicker-snack\", \"burbled\"— canonical onomatopoeic bursts. The poem is unchanged from canonical. At least 2 onomatopoeic bursts exist. So yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: The canonical poem contains multiple stanzas with alliteration (\"slithy toves\", \"gyre and gimble\", \"frumious Bandersnatch\", \"vorpal blade\", \"Tumtum tree\"). Since poem is verbatim for most part, more than 2 stanzas show heavy alliteration. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The poem keeps canonical arc order exactly (warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return). Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: The entire bulk of the poem is verbatim from canonical poem with minimal changes (e.g., colon vs semicolon in some lines, swapping 'has' and 'hast' in one line), but majority of lines are exactly canonical. So no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Since the poem uses canonical poem mostly verbatim and no new coinages, definitely canonical tokens exceed 8. It is a full canonical poem reprint. So no.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: The poem is mostly unchanged from canonical poem with its roughly 8/6 syllable pattern, which fits well. Last 3 lines are out of full stanza, syllable count ambiguous but since partial, not counting strongly; main stanzas pass. So yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The rhyme scheme and end rhymes exactly follow canonical which has varied (2,4) rhymes and no excessive repetition beyond 2. So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: The poem is direct copy of canonical except one line \"Has thou slain...\" replacing \"And hast thou slain...\" — thus content word repetition is balanced, no overuse of any word beyond allowed. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: All coinages are canonical and balanced with a variety of roots with no dominance by any suffix. So yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly is the Jabberwocky subject with canonical characters and events. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Since the text is canonical poem mostly copy-pasted, subtext is same as canonical poem — coherent undertone and implied motif of caution, bravery, triumph, etc. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Also \"murmuration.\"  \n- The first stanza line \"’Twas brillig, and the stubble swayed\" echoed in final stanza line \"’Twas brillig, and the stubble swayed\".  \n- At least two content words repeated (\"brillig\", \"stubble\"), but phrasing slightly varied, continuation with \"murmuration displayed\" instead of \"fields that waved\". This is a partial variation but definitely echoes opening stanza, so ring echo exists.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition: stanza 2 is warning: \"Beware the gobble-goo, my son! ... Beware the slithy screech, and shun The frumious Bandersnatch!\" This matches Lewis Carroll's \"Beware\" admonition structure clearly.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: Stanza 4 mentions the protagonist \"He took the vengeful blade in hand, Long time the foe he sought in planned.\" Indicates preparation with tool and plan before encounter. Also stanza 3 presents the murmuration stretched out—a calm before action. Yes, preparation clearly present.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation:  \n- Stanza 5 says \"Then didst he in a fury plunge, The Jabberwock, with eyes of orange,\" a clear meeting/encounter between protagonist and adversary.  \n- Prior mentions circulate to setup; stanza 5 is confrontation proper.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying decisive action:  \n- Stanza 6: \"He left it dead, and with its head,\" clearly a decisive act resolving tension. Matches canonical decisive action motif.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration:  \n- Stanza 7: includes phrases \"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? Come to my arms, my beamish boy!\" a jubilant acknowledgment and return.  \n- However, the stanza then shifts to echo lines from stanza 1 without explicit celebration words like \"Callooh! Callay!\" but phrase \"Come to my arms\" implies celebration. Considered present.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count:  \n- Coinages (non-canonical invented words): \"gobble-goo\", \"frumious\", \"slithy screech\" (screech arguably common word, slithy canonical), \"murmuration\" (standard English word), \"vengeful\" standard, \"galumphing\" canonical, \"brillig\" canonical.  \n- Only \"gobble-goo\" is clearly new coinage.  \n- \"frumious\" is canonical Carroll coinage.  \n- Coinages <8 distinct. So no, insufficient new coinages (less than 8 distinct new inventions).</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread:  \n- Stanza 2 contains \"gobble-goo\" (new coinage), \"frumious\" (canonical), \"slithy\" (canonical)  \n- Other stanzas mostly standard words or canonical words.  \n- Only one or two stanzas definitively with coinages; not all stanzas contain coinages.  \n- Thus coinage presence in 1 or 2 stanzas out of 7 <100%, so no coinage in every stanza.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named non-canonically and central: \"gobble-goo\" introduced but only mentioned as warning; the main adversary named \"Jabberwock\" canonical, so not new creature/entity. No new central named creature.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"snicker-snack\" in stanza 4, canonical onomatopoeia repeated. Only one onomatopoeic burst; \"One two! One two!\" is counting sound repeated, but not strong onomatopoeic burst. No second distinct onomatopoeic burst.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas beyond incidental repeats:  \n- First stanza: \"stubble swayed\", \"whispers\" and \"sighs\" is mild alliteration.  \n- Second stanza: \"Beware the gobble-goo\", \"be done\" (b alliteration).  \n- Fourth stanza: \"vorpal blade went snicker-snack\" canonical alliteration.  \n- Presence in at least 2 stanzas apparent.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order:  \n- Warning in stanza 2  \n- Preparation in stanza 4  \n- Encounter in stanza 5  \n- Decisive slaying in stanza 6  \n- Return/celebration in stanza 7  \n- Arc beats appear in canonical order</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim canonical lines:  \n- Some lines copied verbatim from canonical poem:  \n - \"’Twas brillig,\" lines (stanza 1 and 7) repeated exactly,  \n - \"Beware the ... Bandersnatch!\" stanza 2 has canonical line structure (though \"gobble-goo\" replaces Jabberwock it repeats canonical lines with slight changes),  \n - \"One two! One two! And through and through, The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!\" in stanza 4 is exact canonical line.  \nSo verbatim canonical lines present, violates criterion.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget:  \n- More than 8 canonical tokens repeated: \"brillig\", \"slithy\", \"frumious\", \"Jabberwock\", \"Bandersnatch\", \"vorpal\", \"snicker-snack\", \"galumphing\", \"beamish\" etc appear.  \n- Total canonical tokens high; not favoring new coinages.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: In quatrains, longer lines approx 8-9 syllables, shorter lines approx 5-7.  \n- Checking stanza 1: lines 4, 8, 8, 8 syllables; no clear long-short alternation.  \n- Other stanzas vary widely, e.g. stanza 2 (4,4,4,4 insufficient), stanza 4 mix of short and long lines but not tightly controlled.  \n- Overall syllable counts not tightly held to canonical pattern.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety (2,4 end-rhymes) varied across stanzas; only stanza 2 has rhyme, others mostly no rhyme or near rhyme, so no repeated rhymes over 2 times. No exact end word reused more than twice.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No overuse of single content word beyond 5 times or 8% except canonical repeated words like \"Jabberwock\" repeated few times appropriately. No problematic overuse detected.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Only one or two coinages, no multiple distinct roots; no suffix dominance issue but coinages too few to evaluate variety. Does not meet threshold.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem addresses Jabberwocky-like theme, mentions Jabberwock and Bandersnatch, with battle theme intact. Matches topic.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Little implied subtext or coherent motif beyond surface action of battle; lacks richer undertone. Subtext weak or absent.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>"}

Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: The poem has \"He left it dead, and with its gaze,\" implying the adversary is slain or defeated decisively. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: The poem ends with partial repeated lines from the start but no explicit joyous return or celebration phrase equivalent to “O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!” or acknowledgement. No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Coinages include burr, bull, mudlenet, wimsy, honing elves, gurgle rings, tusk with tick, klirg, hunn, frumious strands, moosenthaar, flir, honin slurry, broach. Many appear coined and distinct, at least 8 distinct coined words. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: First stanza contains burr, bull, mudlenet, wimsy; second stanza honing slurry; later stanzas have klirg, hunn, frumious strands, moosenthaar, flir, broach; so coinage in nearly every stanza, yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: The creature is \"Klirg\" (new), and \"Hunn bird\" and \"frumious strands\" appear, but “Klirg” is the named entity and adversary, so yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Uses “One two! One two!”, also \"burbled\", “whiffling” (carried over canonically). No clear additional onomatopoeic bursts like “snicker-snack” or “Pop!”, which are particularly marked. “One two!” as rhythmic but weak for onomatopoeia, so borderline but more no than yes, answer no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Some within-line examples like “burr and bull”, “spike and spin in gurgle rings”, “flailed his broach, he ground it true” suggest alliteration and consonance but is not strongly consistent or frequent in multiple stanzas. Only one or two potential stanzas. So no.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The poem loosely follows canonical sequence: warning (\"Beware\"), preparation (taking broach, resting), encounter (slurry appears), action (flailing and killing), but return/celebration missing. So partial order but missing last stage; arc order is broken. No.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: No exact matches; some close phrasings but no direct repetition of canonical lines except ring echo lines which are repeats of poem lines, not canonical lines. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Uses \"vorpal\", \"manxome\", \"frumious\", \"whiffling\", \"burbled\", \"beamish\" (once), and \"snicker-snack\" missing; canonical tokens within 8 or less. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines vary from 8 to 11+ syllables (\"Did spike and spin in gurgle rings\" - 8 syllables; \"The honing elves with greased-up tools\" – 8 syllables; some lines are uneven; shorter lines not consistently 5-7. Syllable count uneven and inconsistent, so no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: End rhyme lines (2,4) mostly varied with some repeats \"catch\" and \"match\", \"through\" and \"true\"; \"gaze\" and \"maze\"; with only one repeated rhyme beyond twice. So variety is okay. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word repeated >5 times or >8%. Words like \"slurry\" and \"burr\" appear multiple times but not excessively. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages include many distinct roots: burr, bull, mudlenet, wimsy, honing, gurgle, tusk, klirg, hunn, frumious, strands, moosenthaar, flir, broach. More than 4 distinct roots with no dominant suffixes. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-style invented creature encounter; consistent with the style and content. Topic focus matches. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem is loosely thematic with slurrying, conflict, and overcoming challenges; some implied complexity in struggle/improvement but subtext is weak and underdeveloped, no strong coherent undertone. No.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>"}

So not all stanzas are quatrains. Total stanza count 8 is within 5-8 range, but not all quatrains, so fails.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>In the reference poem, alternation of longer and shorter lines with ≥2 content words difference is clear. Here, since the first stanza has 5 lines, and overall other quatrains mostly match pattern, likely ≥60% meet line length alternation pattern.

Many are variants of canonical or slight misspellings. Less than 8 really distinct coinages; \"Bluer\", \"Screw-ence\", \"brilling\", \"crudes\", \"budes\", \"mimey\", \"Bluder\" count about 7 or fewer unique roots; borderline but fewer than 8 distinct coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Not all stanzas contain coinages: the ring echo stanzas mostly use canonical and normal words. Early stanzas and some central stanzas have coinages, but whether each stanza has ≥1 coinage is unlikely as some stanzas are fully canonical or contain no invented words except canonical ones.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature named: \"Bluder bird\" named as a non-canonical creature distinct from Jabberwock but central to admonition. However, \"Jabberwock\" is still present and central. \"Bluder bird\" less central than Jabberwock.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeic bursts like \"snicker-snack!\" present, but second onomatopoeia burst missing or minimal. Probably only one onomatopoeic burst clearly present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration and consonance present at least in two stanzas, e.g. \"burbled as it came\", \"slithy crudes\". Some alliteration apparent but not very strong in multiple stanzas.

One, two! And through and through\"). So verbatim lines present, thus no.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical distinct tokens usage: many canonical words reused (Jabberwock, vorpal, snicker-snack, burrbled, tulgey, etc.) over 8 tokens. So >8 canonical tokens present in the poem.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Checking syllable counts line-by-line: mirror original mostly; typical longer lines 8-9 syllables, shorter lines about 6. First stanza 5 lines breaks pattern. Other stanzas meet pattern comfortably.

Each stanza mainly has 4 lines except one appears 3 or 5 lines (one stanza with 6 lines or run-on?), so not all stanzas have 4 lines, and total stanza count is 7 (within 5-8). But all quatrains? No, some stanzas are longer or irregular.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter: The original has ballad meter alternating longer/shorter lines (approx. 8/6 syllables). Here lines vary but not consistently with defined alternating longer/shorter lines with 2+ content words difference in majority of stanzas. Overall, uncertain or no clear strong alternation in ≥60% stanzas.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme: Rhyme between 2nd and 4th lines detected in some stanzas (\"deep\"/\"creep\", \"brood\"/\"shun\" is slant rhyme?); some stanzas lack clear rhyme or have internal rhyme. Avoids AABB but rhymes at 2,4 are irregular. Possibly fewer than 60% stanzas with clear 2,4 rhyme.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Last stanza does not strongly echo first stanza with 2 or more repeated content words or clear refrain.

Beware the gimmy-maw, and shun the snurkle-blind!\").</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: Yes, \"He took his slaying sword in hand: long time he sought - So rested he by nearby Slurghny Fork, And, as in cryptic notes he spored,\" suggests preparation and waiting/thinking before encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: Yes, the creature \"Slured\" arrives: \"The Slured, that lurid beast with eyes afork, Came whiffling through the sludgey smurk.\"</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: Yes, \"One, two! One, two! And through and through The cloven burrblade went snicker-snack!

Yes, coinages in all or nearly all stanzas.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named: Yes, creature “Slured” is named and central; other entities like gimmy-maw and snurkle-blind mentioned as adversaries. \"Slured\" is not canonical Carroll term.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"snicker-snack!\" exact phrase borrowed from canonical poem, so one onomatopoeic burst clearly present. Another onomatopoeic burst not obvious or only slight (\"burbled\" is missing here). Possibly only one onomatopoeic burst counted. Fails ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Clear alliteration seen in stanza 1 \"burr and honing, slurry dripen deep\" (burr, burred?), and \"slimeslugs creep\" (s-l) and \"burr-honed beast\". Multiple stanzas have repeated initial consonants or consonance; at least 2 stanzas with clear alliteration.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The warning comes early, preparation next, then encounter, decisive slay, then celebration. The order is preserved.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: The poem uses some canonical terms like \"whiffling\" and \"snicker-snack!\" verbatim, plus some phrasing \"One, two! One, two!\" is canonical. No entire lines are verbatim from canonical poem; wording changed or lines rearranged. So yes, no full-line verbatim copies beyond short interjections or canonical words.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexicon tokens: canonical words used: whiffling, snicker-snack, frumious, vorpal (no vorpal?), no vorpal but frumious is used, \"O frabjous day\", chortled, beamish not used. Only 3-4 canonical tokens; so canonical token budget ≤8.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: lines are variable in syllable length and often lack the neat 8/6 pattern of Jabberwocky. No consistent ~8 syllables for long line and 5-7 for short line in all quatrains. Overall fails tightness criterion.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Some rhyme pairs repeat (\"snicker-snack\" could appear twice if reading canonical echo, but in model poem only once), rhyme pairs not strongly repeated. Possibly no exact end-word repeated >2 times excluding ring echo. Rhyme variety acceptable.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word overused excessively. Coinages and common words distributed. No dominant repeated content word exceeding 5 times or 8%.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages show variety across different roots: \"slimeslugs\", \"snurkle-blind\", \"burrblade\", \"Slurghny\", \"spored\" etc. No single suffix dominates >50%. Coinage variety good.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly focuses on a fantastical creature encounter like Jabberwocky, adheres well to this topic.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Some implied layers of strange fearful creature, rite of passage or heroic slaying, father-son dynamic, jubilation.

Total stanzas 6 is in range 5-8.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Syllable pattern analysis suggests uneven alternation of longer/shorter lines. Less than 60% of stanzas show clear longer/shorter line alternation with ≥2 content-word difference. Especially the 3rd stanza with 5 lines breaks pattern.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme: (2,4) rhyme check. Many stanzas have rhyme on lines 2 and 4, but the 3rd stanza is 5 lines and rhyme pattern is irregular. The rhyme is slant-compatible in many cases but probably less than 60% of stanzas have clear (2,4) rhyme and AABB dominance is avoided. 3rd stanza does not fit quatrain rhyme pattern.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes beginning stanza phrasing partially (\"snickered,\" \"slice,\" \"galumphing back\") but no ≥2 repeated content words/phrases from opening stanza or a clear refrain.

Counting distinct ones excluding canonical \"mimsy,\" \"mome,\" \"raths,\" \"outgrabe,\" \"tulgey,\" \"galumphing,\" \"whiffling,\" \"vorpal,\" which appear here and are canonical. New coinages are under 8 distinct.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Not every stanza contains a coinage: 1st stanza has coinages (brilling, fithy, floons, borogrooves), 2nd stanza (fours, slicer, frazzle, splice), 3rd stanza (fid, frowsing, splicing, slyed), 4th stanza mentions \"tulgey,\" canonical, \"whiffling,\" canonical; 5th/6th stanzas \"snickered,\" \"slice,\" \"galumphing\" canonical or English words. So only first three stanzas have coinages; less than all stanzas.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named and central to action is \"strands,\" which are adversarial but generic; \"fours\" or \"floons\" are mentioned but no unique named creature distinct from canonical creatures. Probably no distinct non-canonical creature named and central.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: The typical onomatopoeic bursts such as \"snicker-snack\" are changed to \"snickered,\" losing onomatopoeia status. No clear onomatopoeic bursts like \"Pop!\" or \"Hiss!\" appear. \"One two! One two!\" is numeric count, not onomatopoeia.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats evident in some stanzas: \"frowsing and a-splicing,\" \"slicer snickered,\" \"slice the strands,\" \"slyed the angles and the strands got wound.\" At least two stanzas exhibit this feature well.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Plot/arcs order: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration is preserved. Admonition appears early, preparation next, encounter next, decisive action next, celebration at end.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines verbatim from canonical \"Jabberwocky,\" only some canonical words appear but no line exactly copied.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens usage: Words \"mimsy,\" \"mome,\" \"raths,\" \"outgrabe,\" \"tulgey,\" \"galumphing,\" \"whiffling,\" \"vorpal\" appear, which is 8 or fewer canonical lexicon words. So canonical budget met.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count loosely: Some quatrain lines near 8–9 syllables for longer lines, and 5–7 for shorter lines, for example stanza 1 lines (first two lines) roughly fit, but later lines sometimes longer or shorter. Given stanza 3 has 5 lines, metric tightness broken there. Overall, less than 100% meet tightness; borderline, but more than 60% do not meet proper syllable counts strictly.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhyme words on (2,4) lines are not recycled often; rhyme varies between stanzas; no exact end word used >2 times excluding possible ring echo (which is absent). So variety is acceptable.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No overused single content word >5 times or >8% of content words. Words mostly vary and coinages used creatively. No excessive repetition seen.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety measured by roots and suffixes: ~5 distinct roots found, mostly different coinages (\"fid,\" \"fithy,\" \"floons,\" \"slicer,\" \"frazzle,\" \"splice,\" \"frowsing,\" \"slyed\" [borderline English]). The coinage is somewhat diverse; no single suffix dominates >50%. Variety borderline but acceptable.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a creature/adversarial \"fours\" and \"strands\" encounter, evoking same battle motif as Jabberwocky; matches topic of a Carroll-style poem with new content rather than unrelated topic.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem has a motif of cutting/slicing strands as a metaphor for untangling or overcoming a complex problem; some subtle undertone connected between the lines but not strongly developed; subtext is weak or not clearly coherent across all stanzas.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>"}

No clear onomatopoeic exclamations like snicker-snack or hiss. So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: some occur such as \"fearless...grinder went on through,\" \"manxome grind,\" but only one or two stanzas have clear examples. Possibly meets for at least 2 stanzas.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza 2), preparation (stanza 3), encounter (stanza 4), decisive action (stanza 6), return/celebration (stanza 7). Mostly maintains canonical order.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Lines mostly revised; no line matches canonical poem verbatim except the final stanza which repeats canonical stanza but with minor changes like \"cave\" vs \"wabe.\" The title hymn seems reformulated. So mostly no exact verbatim lines.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens present: \"brilling\" (variant of brillig), \"slithy,\" \"toves,\" \"gyre,\" \"gimble,\" \"mimsy,\" \"borogoves,\" \"mome,\" \"raths,\" \"outgrabe,\" \"manxome,\" \"whiffling,\" \"tulgey,\" \"galumphing,\" \"beamish,\" \"mome\" repeated. There are more than 8 canonical tokens used; line 1 and last have many original tokens. So canonical token count >8, fail.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Checking syllables: lines are roughly 8-9 syllables in longer lines and 5-7 in shorter lines in many cases. For example, stanza 1 lines are close to Jabberwocky pattern. So meets syllable tightness.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: rhymes like cave/outgrabe repeats in opening and closing stanza, which is allowed for ring echo. Other stanza rhymes like uncanny/many repeated twice; so some rhyme repetition >2 times. So rhyme variety is limited and fails.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition outside the ring echo: words like \"blade\" repeated often but not excessively; \"hollow\" appears multiple times; no single content word overused beyond 5 times or >8%. So lexical repetition guarded.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety root-wise: coinages (hollowgrindly, frayed whetstone, barbled, fearless grinder) derive from a few roots. Possibly fewer than 4 distinct roots. So no.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>The poem clearly addresses the same subject as \"Jabberwocky\" but replaces the creature with \"Hollowgrindly Blade\" - close topic adherence.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: some undertones of blade sharpening, preparation, and forging courage, possibly a metaphor for facing challenges. But subtext is thin or shallow; no strong coherent implied motif strongly detectable.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>"}

No.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: final stanza echoes opening stanza with at least 2 repeated content words/phrases or refrain.

No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza has at least one coinage?

Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: With few rhyme pairs overall (mostly stanza 2), repetitive rhyme words don't apply; no repeated endings beyond presence in stanza 2; thus no problem with rhyme variety. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No single content word is heavily overused; \"Fimbul\" appears few times; no >5 times or >8% repetition. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Only about 6-7 coinages, with distinct roots including murmuration, branwicks, fimbul, spikeker, myrmygs, fab; no dominant suffix; likely more than 4 roots.
