Count between 5 and 8 inclusive. So all stanzas are quatrains and stanza count correct.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter: Lines alternate in length in >60% of stanzas? The poem lines mostly similar length; alternation between longer/shorter with ≥2 content-word difference is not clearly evident in majority of stanzas. Rhythm somewhat prosaic, no strong alternation like Jabberwocky ballad meter.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (2,4) in ≥60% stanzas?: Mostly rhymes in 2nd and 4th lines per stanza (e.g. light/bright, son/over-grind, wrought/wrought - but note repetition here). Rhyme scheme is mostly ABCB or ABAB; no clear AABB dominance, but end word repetition reduces variety.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: final stanza echoes opening with at least two repeated content words or clear refrain.

Poem uses some canonical words (e.g. uffish), but mainly standard English words for \"blade,\" \"hone,\" \"grind,\" etc. No clear invented coinages or nonce words comparable to Jabberwocky (like slithy, mimsy). Coinage count definitely fewer than 8.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: since coinage count <8, by definition not every stanza can have ≥1 coinage. Most coinages absent.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: the \"blade\" is the focus, but no non-canonical named creature/entity other than \"blade.\" \"Blade\" is common English noun, not a coined entity name. So no non-canonical creature named.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: no bursts like \"snicker-snack!\", \"burbled\", \"hiss\" etc. Onomatopoeic bursts absent.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: some alliteration present (\"blade he ground,\" \"stroke so smooth and burnished\"), but not strongly frequent or in ≥2 stanzas distinctly clear.

So no verbatim lines.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: poem uses \"uffish,\" \"gyre,\" \"mimsy,\" \"burbled,\" and some phrases reworked, but total canonical tokens ≤8, acceptable.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines around 8–9 syllables and shorter lines 5–7. Lines such as \"'Twas blade, and the hollow grind\" (6 syll), \"Did gyre and sparkle in the light\" (7 syll.), other lines like \"And rested he by the sharpening stone\" (8–9 syll). Meter fairly close to Jabberwocky pattern in all quatrains.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: rhyme (2,4) uses similar end words repeatedly (e.g. wrought/wrought repeated in stanza 3), overuse of \"wrought\" and other rhyme words.

The poem uses many canonical words and repeated tokens. However, the poem favors canonical words over new coinage; canonical token presence is high but count of distinct tokens from canonical lexicon is ~12+. So canonical budget >8.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Lines appear roughly syllabically consistent (approx 8-9 syll longer lines, 5-7 shorter lines) but alternating ballad meter pattern (long, short, long, short) is not consistently strong in ≥60% stanzas.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme endings for line 2 and 4 vary across stanzas, no repetition of exact end word >2 times excluding ring echo; rhyme variety is sufficient.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word overused above limits; canonical words repeated but not excessively; lexical repetition guarded.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages largely canonical repeated; only one new coined root (\"Jabberwives\") with mostly canonical coinages repeated.

Hence criterion not fully met.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter requires lines to alternate longer/shorter with ≥2 content words difference in ≥60% stanzas.

Each stanza has at least one coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: \"verglas\" is the central named non-canonical adversary, distinct from canonical Jabberwock.

Probably acceptable.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines mostly ~8–9 syll, shorter lines about 5–7 syll. Some minor variation but overall pattern roughly respects Jabberwocky’s pattern in most stanzas.

Distribution is balanced.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages show multiple distinct roots (gryphon-, frost-, perfidous, lumbsome, brobe, screech-limbs, frost-capped), no single suffix dominates. Coinage variety good.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a similar fantastical adversary theme, naming a creature (\"verglas\") that is distinct but related to the Jabberwocky style. Topic adherence clear.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem evokes icy, frozen, granite, and cold nature motifs contrasting original Jabberwocky's forest.

All stanzas have 4 lines and stanza count is 5, which is within 5–8. So yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Checking ballad meter pattern (alternation of longer/shorter lines with at least 2 content-word difference) in ≥60% of stanzas:  \n- Stanza 1: lines roughly similar length, no clear long/short alternation.  \n- Stanza 2: lines seem like similar lengths; no evident alternating pattern.  \n- Stanza 3: lines roughly similar lengths.  \n- Stanza 4: lines also similar length.  \n- Stanza 5: lines similar length.  \nNo clear alternating longer/shorter line pattern in most stanzas.

Acceptable. So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Does the final stanza echo the opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words or a clear refrain?  \nThe final stanza references \"verglas\" twice and \"granite\" once, which appear in the title and first stanza. The first stanza mentions \"verglas\" implicitly (\"'Twas verglas on granite\"), final stanza closes with \"On verglas on granite\" and \"sleety, cold clash\".  \nContent word repetition is at least 2, so yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition or caution to the protagonist?  \nNo lines caution or warn anything explicitly like \"Beware ...\", no warning stanza or admonitory wording found. No.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation or armament before encounter?  \nThe poem describes \"But onward they pressed\", \"And hastly they climbed\" but no explicit tool, weapon, or resolve preparation. No clear preparation section. No.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Is there a clear meeting/encounter between protagonist and adversary/obstacle?  \nNo explicit \"encounter\" with an adversary named or implied. Mostly a journey through hazards (verglas, shadow, cliffs), but no adversary meeting described. No.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action resolving tension?  \nNo decisive act like slaying or similar resolution event is described. The last stanza depicts returning home but no prior tension resolved by action. No.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return or celebration?  \nLast stanza describes returning home (\"Now back let us flee... till home we are slammed\"), but no jubilant acknowledgement or celebration evident—more a cautionary ending about icy conditions. So return present, celebration weak or absent, borderline but not clear jubilation. Answer no.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Are there ≥8 distinct invented coinages (not canonical or standard English)?  \nInvented words coined appear per stanza: verglas, slinter, sleet, gloam, gloom, wrendyflo, slicksome, hidges, snicking, cracking, bewilderfed, bhelmish, shabbly, stumpy, yoke, skittered, plickety, plock, streelthy, snarling spinestones, clinkering, wobbling, hastly, cracket, chawmping. Many coined or nonce words. Well over 8 distinct coinages. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage?  \nStanza 1: verglas, slinter, wrendyflo, snicking  \nStanza 2: bewilderfed, bhelmish, stumpy  \nStanza 3: plickety, streelthy, snarling spinestones, wobbling  \nStanza 4: hastly, cracket, chomping (close to standard English, but \"cracket\" and \"hastly\" coinages)  \nStanza 5: wobbling, woofling, rammed (rammed is standard word, but woofling coined).  \nAll stanzas have at least one coinage. Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Is a non-canonical creature/entity named and central to action (not Jabberwock)?  \nNo specific creature or entity is named. \"Bhelmish folk\" are described but not an adversary or central named creature. So no.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Are there ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts (like \"snicker‑snack\", \"Pop\", \"Hiss\")?  \n\"snicking and cracking\", \"cracket and clap\" may convey onomatopoeia, but \"snicking\", \"cracket\", \"clap\", \"cracking\" are not clear exclamatory bursts or distinct onomatopoeia words like canonical example. Not strong or repeated. Likely no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Do ≥2 stanzas show clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental?  \nStanza 1: \"verglas on granite\", \"slinter sleet\", \"gloam and gloom\", \"wrendyflo\" – some consonance but mild.\nStanza 3: \"skittered and slid\", \"snarling spinestones\" shows clear alliteration.\nStanza 5: \"wobbling and woofling\" alliteration present.  \nAt least 2 stanzas do show clear alliteration/consonance. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Do the arc beats appear in canonical order (warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration)?  \nNo clear warning/admonition in stanza 2 or early; no preparation described well; journey described but no encounter or decisive act; return present.  \nOrder partial or incomplete, no clear arc sequence matching canonical poem. No.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line exactly matches the canonical poem?  \nNo lines match exactly any canonical lines like \"'Twas brillig...\" or \"One, two! One, two!\". All lines original wording. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Are distinct canonical tokens ≤8, favoring new coinages?  \nCanonical tokens used:  \"Did\", \"And\", some standard English words. No canonical Carroll lexicon like \"brillig\", \"slithy\", \"toves\", \"gyre\", \"gimble\", \"wabe\", \"mimsy\", etc. Thus canonical lexicon minimal or none. Canonical tokens ≤8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness matching Jabberwocky: long lines ~8–9 syllables, short lines ~5–7 syllables in every stanza?  \nCounting line 1 stanza 1: \"'Twas verglas on granite, and the slinter sleet\" = ~10 syllables  \nLine 2 stanza 1: \"Did gloam and gloom in the wrendyflo air\" = ~10 syllables  \nLine 3 stanza 1: \"All slicksome were the paths, and the hidges did meet\" = ~11 syllables  \nLine 4 stanza 1: \"With a snicking and cracking, as though 'twere rare.\" = ~11 syllables  \nLines are all more than target syllable counts, no clear long/short alternation. Pattern differs from Jabberwocky. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety - no more than 2 repetitions of exact rhyme words in (2,4) positions across stanzas?  \nRhyme pairs: \"air/rare\",\"tread/spread\",\"slammed/rammed\". Different rhymes, each pair unique, no repeated rhyme end words >2 times. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard - no single content word overused >5 times or >8%?  \nNo content word is repeated excessively. \"verglas\" appears 4–5 times but within limits. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety - do coinages show ≥4 distinct roots (no single coined suffix dominates)?  \nCoinages include roots: verglas, slinter, wrendyflo, snicking, bewilderfed, bhelmish, plickety, streelthy, cracket, woofling, chomp (less coined, more standard).  \nSeveral distinct roots, suffixes vary, no dominance of single suffix. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence - does poem clearly use wintery icy theme with frozen hazard (veglas on granite) as subject, not drifting away?  \nThe poem consistently describes \"verglas\", ice, cold terrain, slippery paths, so topic about icy conditions matching the poem title and subject is sustained. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Coherent underlying subtext or motif beyond surface action?  \nPoem mostly depicts hazardous icy journey, repeated references to slippery, frozen hazard, cold hardship, and ultimately return. Possible undertone of man’s struggle and caution in cold elements, but subtle and not strongly developed motif or overt subtext. Borderline, but insufficiently clear or coherent layered subtext.

No ring echo.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Contains early admonition: stanza 3 includes \"Beware, my son, of the third-rail’s glow,\" fulfilling the warning/admonition criterion.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>No clear protagonist preparation (taking a tool or resting or planning) prior to encounter; poem describes the hum and warning but no explicit preparation seen. No.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>There is no clear meeting or confrontation with a creature or adversary. The poem speaks about the hum of the third rail and caution but no direct encounter described—no adversary or obstacle personified or directly met. No.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>No decisive slaying or action resolving tension is present. The poem warns, describes, and admires the third-rail hum but lacks a narrative climax or decisive action. No.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>No return or celebration is noted. The poem ends on a general note about danger and power; no homecoming or jubilant acknowledgement. No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented coinages excluding canonical words. Many canonical words are reused (\"slithy,\" \"borogoves,\" \"wabe,\" \"mome,\" \"raths,\" \"outgrabe,\" \"frumious\"). Other coinages: \"tintinnabulation,\" \"slithy thrum,\" \"woozy,\" \"electrical foaming,\" \"perilous, sly, electrical glum,\" \"electric eave,\" \"frumious current,\" \"twine.\" But \"tintinnabulation,\" \"woozy,\" \"electrical,\" \"perilous,\" \"sly,\" \"power,\" \"hum,\" \"glum,\" \"eave,\" \"current,\" \"dance\" are normal English words or standard. \"Slithy\" and \"frumious\" are canonical coinages. No strong evidence for ≥8 novel coinages beyond canonical reuse except \"tintinnabulation,\" which is standard English word, not Carroll style coinage. No other clearly invented novel words. Below threshold. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage? Canonical coinages appear in all stanzas (\"borogoves,\" \"wabe,\" \"mome,\" \"raths,\" \"outgrabe,\" \"frumious,\" \"slithy\"). So yes, all stanzas have at least one coinage (canonical). Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature or non-canonical entity named and central to action (not Jabberwock)? No new named creatures/entities; \"third-rail\" is a real-world object, not a coinaged fantasy creature; canonical creatures appear only referenced, not central to action. No.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia two or more bursts? None detected. Poem mentions \"hum,\" \"thrum,\" \"tintinnabulation\" (which is a bell-like sound word), but no obvious onomatopoeic bursts like \"snicker-snack,\" \"Pop!\" or \"Hiss!\" etc. \"tintinnabulation\" is a sound-word but a known English noun, not an expressive burst. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in at least 2 stanzas beyond incidental? Some alliteration e.g., \"third-rail,\" \"tintinnabulation,\" \"twine,\" \"thrum\" but fairly light. Possibly stanza 1: “third-rail,” “tintinnabulation,” “power,” “wires resounds.” 2nd stanza has \"wabe,\" \"wires.\" Some mild instances but not very strong or clear. Conservative judgment: no clear alliteration beyond incidental repeated sounds in two stanzas. No.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning present early (yes); preparation (no); encounter (no); decisive action (no); return/celebration (no). Arc order incomplete and breaks after warning.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines verbatim from canonical poem found, only some canonical words reused in different constructions. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used: slithy, borogoves, wabe, mome, raths, outgrabe, frumious. Count ≤8; meets canonical budget. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Long lines ~8–9 syllables; short lines ~5–7 syllables? Checking stanza 1 as sample: \"Oh, the hum of the third-rail at dusk,\" (9 syllables approx); \"As the sky does dim and the stars do husk,\" (9 syllables); \"A tintinnabulation of power abounds,\" (11 syllables, slightly longer); \"A slithy thrum through the wires resounds.\" (9 syllables). Here line lengths seem more similar rather than alternating longer/shorter; all long-ish lines. No clear alternating syllabic meter like Jabberwocky. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety for (2,4) lines across stanzas with varied rhymes, no excessive neologism reuse? Since only half stanzas have (2,4) rhyme, variety is moot; rhymes are minimal and some repeated rhyme endings appear (\"husk\" used twice). No strong rhyme variety. No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No evidence of lexical overuse. Reused content words like \"power,\" \"hum,\" \"third-rail,\" \"electrical\" but none appear >5 times or above 8% content words. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: mostly canonical coinages reused and a few English words; no clear coined roots variety or invented suffixes. No.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem addresses the \"third-rail hum at dusk,\" a subject quite different from Lewis Carroll's nonsense creatures and adventures. It attempts to mimic a \"Jabberwocky\" style but shifts topic to an electrical phenomenon. According to instructions, poem must address given topic (which was none in this prompt) or match Jabberwocky theme? Since no topic specified, default is evaluable for Jabberwocky style match, so no match to Jabberwocky topic (creature battle). No.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: some implied warning about danger of the third-rail power, electrical hazard, but no deeper or coherent layered motif akin to Jabberwocky's mythic battle and heroism implied subtext. Weak or no coherent subtext.

Lines tend to be similar lengths overall.  \nConservative judgment: fails clearly alternating meter pattern ≥60% stanzas.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme (2,4) rhyme per stanza in ≥60% stanzas and avoid AABB dominance:  \nLook at stanza endings (2nd and 4th lines) rhymes or slant rhymes:  \n1st stanza 2nd line = \"wabe\" // 4th line = \"outgrabe\" (rhyme)  \n2nd stanza 2nd line = \"catch\" // 4th line = \"Bin!\" (not rhyme)  \n3rd stanza 2nd line = \"sought—\" // 4th line = \"thought.\" (rhyme)  \n4th stanza 2nd line = \"flame,\" // 4th line = \"came!\" (rhyme/slant)  \n5th stanza 2nd line = \"snicker-snack!\" // 4th line = \"back.\" (rhyme/slant)  \n6th stanza 2nd line = \"beamish boy!\" // 4th line = \"joy.\" (rhyme)  \n7th stanza 2nd line = \"meet, and make amends;\" // 4th line = \"Dear Friends.\" (rhyme)  \n\nRhyme in stanzas 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (6 out of 7) → >85%. But stanza 2 does not rhyme lines 2 and 4. AABB dominance is not seen - lines 1 and 2 do not rhyme consistently. So criterion met.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: final stanza should echo opening with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases or clear refrain.  \nOpening stanza has “brillig,” “wabe,” “outgrabe” (canonical) plus original words like “reglet grove,” “wimble,” “sliddlers.”  \nClosing stanza includes \"‘Twas reglet,\" \"furniture,\" \"make amends,\" \"Dear Friends\" – no clear reuse of original opening words “brillig,\" \"wabe,\" or \"outgrabe\" repeated in same form. The final stanza includes \"‘Twas reglet\" but not \"brillig\" or canonical tokens. So no strong ring echo with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases (canonical or original from the first stanza).  \nNo clear refrain repeated.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present: stanza 2 includes \"“Beware the Quoin-Wock, my son! / The arms that wedge, the tongues that spin! / Beware the Plate-Bot, and shun / The frumious Galley-Bin!”\" matching the style of the original warning. So yes, clear admonition present early.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before encounter: stanza 3 describes \"He took his Helveticard in hand\" and \"Long time the Quoin-Wock he sought— / So rested he by the Standing Press / And stood awhile in thought.\" This clearly depicts preparation and resolve before the confrontation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: stanza 4 narrates \"And as in uffish thought he stood, / The Quoin-Wock, with eyes of flame, / Came columnining through the wood, / And burbled as it came!\" — a clear meeting between hero and adversary.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: stanza 5 narrates the attack \"One, two! One, two! And through and through / The Sliver-Blade went snicker-snack! / He left it dead, and with its head / He went galumphing back.\" Clearly decisive slaying or defeat.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: stanza 6 \"And, has thou slain the Quoin-Wock? / Come to my arms, my beamish boy! / O typefet!!! O Reglet-Snare! / He chortled in his joy.\" Celebration and jubilant return evident.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Distinct coinages count: non-canonical invented words: reglet, wimble, sliddlers, Quoin-Wock, Plate-Bot, Galley-Bin, Helveticard, Standing Press, columnining, Sliver-Blade, typefet, Reglet-Snare, flumchy. Counting above 8 distinct coinages easily.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinages spread: Each stanza includes ≥1 coined word:  \n- stanza 1: reglet, wimble, sliddlers  \n- stanza 2: Quoin-Wock, Plate-Bot, Galley-Bin, frumious (canonical)  \n- stanza 3: Helveticard, Standing Press  \n- stanza 4: Quoin-Wock (repeated), columnining  \n- stanza 5: Sliver-Blade  \n- stanza 6: typefet, Reglet-Snare  \n- stanza 7: reglet, flumchy (all stanza contain at least one coinage)  \nMeets criterion.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central (not Jabberwock): “Quoin-Wock” is the clear noncanonical creature replacing Jabberwock, central to plot and confrontation.

Is there ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts? Only \"snicker-snack\" clear onomatopoeic burst, \"burbled\" less so but still considered onomatopoeic term canonical. No other onomatopoeia bursts (like Pop!, Hiss! etc.)  \nOne canonical onomatopoeic burst plus one less obvious onomatopoeia — acceptable? The instructions specify ≥2 bursts. Given \"burbled\" and \"snicker-snack\" are canonical onomatopoeia, yes, so meets criterion.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas beyond incidental:  \nExamples:  \n- stanza 1 “reglet grove,” “wimble were the sliddlers” (w- sounds)  \n- stanza 2 “Plate-Bot,” “frumious Galley-Bin” (G-alliteration)  \n- stanza 4 “burbled as it came,” \"columnining\" (c- sounds)  \nClear alliteration present in multiple stanzas. Criterion met.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc beats in canonical order (warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration):  \nOrder:  \n- warning in stanza 2  \n- preparation in stanza 3  \n- encounter in stanza 4  \n- decisive action in stanza 5  \n- return/celebration in stanza 6  \nOrder correctly follows canonical arc.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: The poem reproduces structure and phrase styles but no line is exactly copied from canonical poem aside from similar line openings. Unique lines rewritten with new words; no exact match found. Passes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexicon usage ≤8 distinct tokens:  \nUsage includes canonical words: brillig, wabe, outgrabe, frumious, uffish, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish. Counting distinct canonical tokens: brillig, wabe, outgrabe, frumious, uffish, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, beamish = 9 tokens, one over limit. However batch \"frumious\" is arguably borderline as adjective variant.  \nLine count: 9 canonical tokens clearly used. Does this exceed 8? Just barely, so fails criterion strictly.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines ~8–9 syllables, shorter lines ~5–7 syllables, alternating  \nSample: stanza 1 lines:  \n- 'Twas brillig, and the reglet grove (7 syllables)  \n- Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; (8 syllables)  \n- All wimble were the sliddlers, (6 syllables)  \n- And the storage shelves outgrabe. (6 syllables)  \nLine patterns roughly match Jabberwocky’s ~8/6 pattern in most stanzas. Length alternation less clear, but syllable counts tight within expected range. Passes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme words varied, no exact end word reused more than twice except ring echo (which is missing or weak).  \nRhymes: outgrabe (stanza 1), Bin (stanza 2), thought (stanza 3), came (stanza 4), back (stanza 5), joy (stanza6), Friends (stanza 7) — all different. Good variety. Passes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word overused (>5 times or >8% content words) outside ring echo: no extreme repetitions detected. Pass.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: ≥4 distinct roots (not just suffixes): reglet, wimble, sliddlers, Quoin-Wock, Plate-Bot, Galley-Bin, Helveticard, Standing Press, columnining, Sliver-Blade, typefet, Reglet-Snare, flumchy — many roots, so no dominant suffix. Pass.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly addresses a Jabberwock-style narrative with a new \"Quoin-Wock\" creature, maintaining theme of fantastical battle, so topic adherence is good. Pass.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent undertone detected: Implied theme of battle against strange mechanical/office-themed monsters (Quoin-Wock, Plate-Bot), possible metaphor for life or work challenges; “furniture” and “reglet” reinforce an undertone beyond surface. Coherent subtext/modality present.</C24_think>\n</think>\n\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Warning (stanza 2) and prep (3) present, but no encounter or decisive action, then celebration (4).

The alternation is somewhat uneven and subtle.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme: In ≥60% of stanzas, lines 2 and 4 rhyme with near slant rhyme (\"cleave\"/\"weave\", \"true\"/\"you\", \"zeal\"/\"reveal\", \"flood\"/\"blood\", \"care\"/\"heir\", \"way\"/\"fray\"). No AABB dominance present; rhyme pattern is consistent ABAB.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza echoes the opening theme with repeated content words (\"burrsome\", \"slurry’s work\", \"whetstone’s task\"), but no exact phrase repetition or clear refrain. The echo is thematic and conceptual but weak on repeated exact words.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition: Present in stanza 2 - \"Beware the Burr, my son!\" and the caution about slurry and dulling swarf.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: Present - protagonist takes blade in hand, sharpens with honing paste and grindstone; clear preparation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: No direct meeting with an adversary, but the \"slurry\" and \"dulling swarf\" are obstacles mentioned. The poem is more metaphorical; no clear direct encounter with named adversary.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: The sharpening process is the decisive action; \"sharpened with a scouring zeal,\" final triumphant shine. It resolves central tension metaphorically (edge dulling addressed).</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Present in stanza 5 and 6; phrases like \"Come to my arms\", \"Oh frabjous day!\", \"Triumphant shine\" suggest celebration and accomplishment.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Coinages present include \"burrsome\" (adj form of burr), \"frumious\" (canonical but rare; allowed), \"swarf\" (technical, borderline, but standard English), maybe \"burr\" (standard), and some metaphorical uses.

Encounter somewhat ambiguous (slurry/dulling swarf as obstacles). Probably yes, given metaphorical encounter.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: No exact canonical lines copied; all phrasing is original or variant.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Uses ≤8 canonical tokens: \"brillig\", \"frumious\", \"Oh frabjous day\", \"bane\" not present, but \"frabjous\" and \"brillig\" appear once, so within limit.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines tend to be about 8-9 syllables; shorter lines around 5-7 syllables fairly consistently.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme words mostly unique for each stanza, no excessive repetition; rhyme endings vary well.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No single content word overused >5 times or >8%; repetition is controlled.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Few coinages and limited distinct roots; \"burrsome\", \"frumious\", \"swarf\" (borderline), \"slurry\" (normal English).
