Meets quota.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter checking for ≥60% quatrains with alternating long/short lines differing ≥2 content words: lines mostly 7–9 syllables; however, the variation in content words between lines is low and inconsistent, no clear strong pattern of alternating longer/shorter lines with content-word difference visible in at least 5 stanzas. Likely no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme check on lines (2,4) in ≥60% stanzas: rhymes mostly present (maze/divine; art/part; teeth/beneath; hand/grace; glare/share; care/fare; last/clear; surpassed/furniture). Avoids AABB dominance (mostly ABAB or ABCB). Rhymes appear mostly end sounds, though some slant rhymes. Enough stanzas with 2/4 rhyme present (≥5 of 8). Yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes the opening stanza? No strong content word repetition or refrains linking final stanza back to first stanza lines. Words like \"Reglet\" and \"furniture\" appear, but no clear repeated content phrases from first stanza (which mentions brillig and printshop maze), thus no ring composition with ≥2 repeated content words or refrain. No.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Presence of early admonition/warning: yes, stanza 3 contains “Beware the slugs!” and “Beware the typeface's teeth!”, clearly an admonition to the protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation by the protagonist before encounter: yes, protagonist “took his pica stick in hand,” measured, handled reglets and furniture carefully, preparing the process. Preparation is explicit.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter/confrontation with adversary/obstacle: “Then came the chase” stanza mentions “where metal locked,” “reglet’s rule and furniture’s name, in order met their fare,” implying a confrontation/challenge occurring. Though abstract and metaphorical, there is an encounter present.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action resolving tension: “When the press did turn at last,” and “printed sheet — the past surpassed,” indicating the success/end of challenge. Decisive act is implied via press turning and final print.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return or celebration: final stanza’s positive tone “printed sheet — the past surpassed,” celebrating success, though no explicit “return home” or “jubilation” addressed, still a form of celebratory completion. Counts as yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count of invented coinages distinct from canonical and standard English: “Reglet” and “furniture” are real print terms but used as poetic elements; mostly standard English words with no clear invented coinages distinct enough; “pica stick” is printing terminology but standard. No strong neologisms or coined words identified reaching ≥8. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains ≥1 coinage: No strong invented words; mostly standard English and known printing terms repeated. Coinages per stanza not present.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: No new named creature or entity beyond “slugs” (warning against \"slugs\"), but \"slugs\" is a real word, not necessarily a coined fantasy entity. Thus, no named invented creature central to action. No.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>≥2 onomatopoeic bursts: no explicit onomatopoeia like “snicker-snack!” or “burbled” present; words like “clatter” or “turn” are normal verbs, not onomatopoeia bursts. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>≥2 stanzas show clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental: some alliteration like \"hands a-clatter / steady art\" (stanza 2) and “metal locked with care,” “press did turn,” but no strong evidence of clear prominent alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats in at least 2 stanzas. Borderline but mostly no.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc beats in canonical order warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return celebration: Stanza 3 warning, stanzas 4-5 preparation, stanza 7 encounter, stanza 8 decisive act and celebration. The order aligns well. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No exact verbatim line matches: no lines exactly match canonical poem lines; all unique wording. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Distinct canonical tokens ≤8: canonical tokens “brillig”, “slithy”, “toves”, etc., only “brillig” appears once in first stanza; no other canonicals found. Canonical count ≤8, yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: lines length roughly ~8–9 for longer lines and ~5–7 for shorter lines. Mostly consistent with some quatrains alternating longer/shorter line syllables approximately in Jabberwocky style. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: rhymes (2,4) varied: endings like maze/divine, art/part, teeth/beneath, hand/grace, glare/share, care/fare, last/clear, surpassed/furniture show a good variety with no apparent reuse >2 times, yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no content word overused excessively; usage is balanced. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages under threshold; with no strong coinage present, cannot assess variety. No.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem centers clearly on printing terminology and setting but uses the style and narrative arc akin to Jabberwocky; the topic modeled is clearly related to the printing shop (reglet, furniture), which is the poetic focus. So yes, poem matches topic of printing/typography in Jabberwocky style.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied layer: subtle metaphor of printing as battle/adventure, with “Beware the slugs” and “chase,” underlying theme of craftsmanship and challenge. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}
