No gloomery but relevant words; ice-wisps (compound invented).

Counting distinct coinages disregarding canonical: whettletime, Grindle, glimmed, quiver-quite, quench-oil, temper-tongues, sparksicame, sparksiwent, steeley, tick-tockle-blue. At least 9 coinages, meets ≥8. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Spread of coinages: Each stanza contains at least one coinage: 1st stanza “whettletime”, “Grindle Row”, 2nd stanza “frumious Paper-thin” (Paper-thin borderline?), 3rd stanza “sparksicame” and “sparksiwent”, 4th stanza “whiffling” and “burbled” (both canonical), 5th stanza “tick-tockle-blue”, 6th stanza “whettletime” echo. Nearly all stanzas have at least one coinage—\"paper-thin\" is English words combined but hyphenated, borderline but usually not counting as coinage; ignoring, still several coinages in each. Slightly borderline for some stanzas but better to say yes due to repeated coinages in echo. Accept yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named and central (not Jabberwock): “Hollow Grind” named clearly, main adversary. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: “whiffling” and “burbled” are canonical but count as onomatopoeia; “tick-tockle-blue” imitates sound (tic-tac/tick-tock).

Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness with longer lines 8–9 syllables, shorter lines 5–7 syllables: Checking stanza 2 (4 lines): “Beware the Hollow Grind, my son!” (7 syllables) / “The toothy ridge, the biting done!” (7 syll) / “Beware the Burr-thrift edge, and shun” (7 syll) / “the frumious Paper-thin!” (6 syll). All lines shorter than strict Jabberwocky longer line target 8-9. Some 7 syll lines (shorter range); lines are close to uniform length, so not good alternation. Meter not tight. Probably no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: rhymes at (2,4) mostly: son/shun, done/shun (slant), went/spent, haze/blaze, blue/gleam (slant), find/joy (less perfect rhyme), hooray/joy (near rhyme). Some rhymes repeated (son/shun and done/shun), but rhymes vary across stanzas. No single ending overused more than twice (excluding ring). Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No word is used excessively. “the” and short function words omitted, content words distinct and spread evenly. No single word over 5 times or 8% content words. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: ≥9 coinages with multiple distinct roots and suffixes: whettletime, glimmed, quiver-quite, quench-oil, sparksicame, sparksiwent, steeley, tick-tockle-blue.

Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly about a Jabberwocky-style encounter, naming a specific adversary “Hollow Grind” rather than Jabberwock. Adheres to the topic of a Jabberwocky-inspired poem. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/motif beyond surface: underlying motif of a dangerous grind, challenge, and triumph evident coherently across poem; steel imagery, preparation, conflict, and celebration suggest a layered reading about persevering hazards.
