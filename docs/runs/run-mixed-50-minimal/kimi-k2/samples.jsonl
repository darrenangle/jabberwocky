But stanza lines vary; many stanzas have 4 lines, some have more or fewer. For example, stanza 2 has 4 lines, stanza 4 has 4 lines; but stanza 6 appears to have 4; \"Sleek!—the gleam slid shadows widdershins,\" stanza 7 seems to have 4 lines; stanza 8 also 4 lines. So likely all stanzas are quatrains. Stanza count is 8 and all stanzas seem 4 lines. So all quatrains and stanza count is 8 which is within 5–8.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>The meter shows some intonation variation but difficult to confirm clear alternation of longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content word difference in 60% of stanzas. The lines are heavily coined and more irregular than Jabberwocky, with uneven rhythm. Probably not clearly alternating longer/shorter lines in ≥60% of stanzas.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme assessment: some slant rhymes appear (e.g., \"whurr\" and \"twig\" no rhyme, but maybe \"bone\" and \"own\" rhyme; stanza 2 lines 2 and 4 rhyme well. Looking at others, for stanza 1, \"fallo/w\" and \"twig\" no rhyme; stanza 3 \"slid\" and \"hid\" rhyme (lines 2 and 4), stanza 4 \"rattle\" and \"spurn\" do not rhyme well. So less than 60% stanzas have clear rhymes on lines 2 and 4. Also no clear avoidance of AABB dominance as AABB not used mostly.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The last stanza echoes the opening content somewhat via words like \"whisper\", \"burr-word\", \"whetted slurr\" evoking the opening's \"burr-corn wheezles brig\". Not exactly repeating ≥2 content words, but has clear echo/motif as refrain-like closing. So partial ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>No explicit warning or admonition given in early stanza. No phrase like \"Beware...\" or equivalent caution to protagonist. No clear warning stanza.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>No clear preparation stage: no mention of hero arming or planning before encounter. The poem lacks a clear protagonist or agent undertaking preparation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>There is a mention of a \"glavver\" seeking a \"burr,\" with tension implied by \"blade of skrike and slurpish bone\", and a kind of confrontation or scene with \"edge on edge went flurble-churn.\" This suggests an encounter or confrontation with the \"glavver\".</C8_think>\n<C9_think>No clear decisive act like slaying or resolution of central tension. The poem ends with a more meditative tone rather than resolution through decisive action.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>No clear return or celebration stanza. The poem closes with a warning or reflective mood rather than triumphant return.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Many invented coinages: e.g. Whiffle, Grindle-whurr, Awnly, timpled, mornish, burr-corn, wheezles, snicker-snooking, woffling, wickled, shiver-shunting, glavver, skrike, slurpish, hone, tock-to-clock, tickle-shadow, gally-goggered, grittle, spittled, glintish, driggle-draggle, flurble-churn, snoppet, cornel, gnarbled, burr-bound, murmured, moontalk, widdershins, swoggle, pocked, glintish, whetted slurr. There are definitely over 8 distinct coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Nearly every stanza has at least one invented coinage. Coinages are spread uniformly throughout.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>\"glavver\" is a non-canonical named creature/entity and clearly central to action (searching for burr, confronted, battled). Not \"Jabberwock\" but a fresh invented creature.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeic bursts are rare; \"snicker-snooking\" is reminiscent of \"snicker-snack\" but this is a coined compound, maybe onomatopoeic. No other clear onomatopoeic bursts like \"Pop!\" \"Hiss!\" \"Snicker-snack!\" found. So less than 2. Possibly only 1.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration and consonance present in phrases like \"shiver-shunting glavver,\" \"spittled, sparkled, slurried, slid,\" \"gally-goggered grittle droplets,\" \"driggle-draggle, wheeze and rattle,\" \"scribbled, trembled\" etc. Multiple stanzas show clear alliteration beyond incidental. At least two stanzas qualify.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: no early warning or admonition, no preparation, then encounter is present, no decisive action, no return/celebration. So arc beats are out of canonical order or incomplete.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines exactly match canonical poem's lines; all lines are original.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens are minimal or absent except a few like \"snicker-snacking\" or close to it: \"snicker-snooking\" is a coinage variation, not canonical. \"widdershins\" and \"moontalk\" are not canonical tokens. No canonical tokens from the canonical lexicon are obviously used, favoring new coinages.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Long lines approximate 8-9 syllables, short lines ~5-7 syllables is unclear. The cadence is irregular with heavily coined words; some lines are longer or shorter but not consistently aligned as Jabberwocky pattern. Probably does not meet the ≥60% quatrains syllable tightness.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The poem uses different rhymes across stanzas with no obvious repetition of end words >2 times except weak ring echo. So rhyme variety is acceptable.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No obvious lexical word is overused excessively; most content words are unique or rare, so no overuse detected.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages appear diverse with at least 4 distinct roots; suffix repetition is low or negligible, demonstrating variety beyond single suffix over 50%.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>The poem clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-style invented creature and confrontation theme, close in topic to Jabberwocky, no differing subject substituted.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>The poem develops an implied motif of mysterious natural phenomena and a mysterious creature hunting, with undertones of caution and elusive forces in mystical woods, so a coherent subtext is detectable.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>no</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

First stanza: 6 lines; second: 5 lines; rest: 4 lines. Thus not all stanzas are 4 lines. Total stanza count 6 is within 5 to 8, but \"all stanzas have 4 lines\" is not met for first two. So no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Examining meter pattern: lines within stanzas show some alternation in line length, but the first two stanzas have irregular length lines, with some longer than 9 syllables and shorter lines fewer than 5 or 6. Later stanzas show more regular meter with alternating long and short lines but less clear content-word count difference. Overall, fewer than 60% of stanzas clearly alternate longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content-word difference. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>In quatrains, rhyme on lines 2 and 4 is only partially consistent. Some slant rhymes occur (swoon / swoon on stanza 2, clove / rove on stanza 5). But given first two stanzas are not quatrains and rhymes are not consistent in ≥60% stanzas, also possible AABB dominance in some. So no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes the first stanza's theme of caution about icy conditions, not direct repeated phrasing or clear refrain, and does not repeat two or more content words or phrases exactly from the first stanza. No ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present: second stanza includes \"Beware the slabthen slimecold glare,\" (an explicit caution). So yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation present: stanza 3 describes protagonist taking \"vorpax pick in paw,\" \"luffed against ...\" etc., indicating preparation and approach before confrontation. So yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter described: protagonist confronts icy obstacle (\"Then ten-slip, eleven-slip—scrabble—through...\"). Clear meeting between protagonist and obstacle. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: stanza 5 describes \"the pick-ax slew and clabit! clabit! through it clove,\" ending with \"so stilled the sleetstung stone again,\" a clear decisive action resolving tension. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: last stanza is more cautionary than celebratory. No jubilant acknowledgement or homecoming. No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Counting distinct invented coinages: verglocrine, glassicle, gelid, slyvers, rime-stitched, vizbous, vortals, clippling, croft-rapt, sluicing, skrithered, skratched, slabthen, slimecold, slicklit, slitheroon, snibble-griggling, snib, swoon, footwern, frostle, gnurls, knibbles, sprocken, vorpax, thrash-rubbered, ropegum, luffed, scrunt-scurlum, skreechstone, bibble, clabit, incendibl-blue, raspum, fritter-glint, griptic, verglast, slicklets, fang-nibbled, crown, polar fleece (compound words, some may be standard). Definitely ≥8 distinct coinages. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Checking coinage per stanza: first two stanzas have multiple coinages (glassicle, verglocrine, slyvers, etc.); subsequent stanzas also have at least one coinage word per stanza. So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>No named non-canonical creature/entity is obvious; focus is on icy obstacle/phenomenon but no creature name like “Jabberwock” or other entity. So no.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"clabit! clabit!\" is a clear onomatopoeic burst in stanza 5; possibly \"skrithered & skratched\" (imitating scratch sounds) in stanza 1 or 2. So at least two onomatopoeic bursts. Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: multiple stanzas show alliteration, e.g., stanza 1 \"glassicle glint, gelid slyvers snip,\" stanza 2 \"slabthen slimecold slicklit shard slitheroon,\" stanza 3 \"thrash-rubbered ropegum; de-dazzled mask,\" stanza 5 \"splinter raspum cold-shrap rove.\" So yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (present in stanza 2), then preparation (stanza 3), then encounter (stanza 4), decisive act (stanza 5), but final stanza returns to caution instead of return/celebration, breaking the arc order. So no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines verbatim copied from canonical poem; wording is all new. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Few canonical tokens used: \"Beware\" is canonical, \"One, two\" is canonical style but not an exact token, \"vorpal\" replaced by \"vorpax,\" no other canonical words appear. Canonical tokens ≤8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Examining syllables: many lines in first two stanzas exceed Jabberwocky’s tight ~8/6 pattern; later stanzas closer but variance is wide. Not all stanzas have correct syllable patterns. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: rhymes (2,4) are mostly different across stanzas: e.g., screes/sou, slitheroon/swoon, roveg/clove/shoon — only clove/rove repeats, but just once. So rhyme variety is acceptable. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: no single content word is overused; coinages and common words vary. No overuse. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: multiple distinct coinages from differing roots (glassicle, verglocrine, slyvers, vortals, skrithered, slabthen, slimecold, snibble-griggling, vorpax, scrunt-scurlum), diverse roots and suffixes; no suffix dominates over 50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem centers on caution, encounter, and conquest over a treacherous icy climb or slick rock (the \"Verglocrine\"), a named concept distinct but fitting the style; no topic substitution, consistent subject. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: cautionary motif about nature's hazards, perseverance, risk and hazard awareness, underlying metaphor of struggle and vigilance. Coherent implied layer beyond surface action.

The ropy slyde—the clawing that will spy!” which is a warning to the protagonist; fulfills admonition criterion.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament present: protagonist takes a specific tool “fid of flombled bronze,” and prepares by whistling, easing twist, and “skriffed the weary strand” before encounter; clear preparation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: stanza 3 describes a “shrieking” and tangled coil attacking, protagonist using the fid to split; clearly a confrontation.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: stanza 4 details fid “danced through” and “left it neat,” “hauled the frayed knot wide,” resolving tension decisively.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: stanza 6 has protagonist’s “Huzzah!” and joyous exclamation with cheering from surroundings; stanza 7 returns to quiverdeck and “sponsy boy,” indicating a return; stanza 8 celebrates “fid-bright joy”; yes for return/celebration.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: many coined words distinct from canonical lexicon, e.g. grinnicle, quiverdeck, gimbled, clew-grommets, quishy, quid, ropy slyde, fid, flombled, knurl-ed, skriffed, burfled, yabber-blistered, crankle, snitter-tuck, grosstrake, worrible, mungled, yarms, jollig, famblings etc. Well over 8 distinct invented coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Every stanza contains at least one coinage or invented term, often multiple; coinage spread consistent across entire poem.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named non-canonical creature/entity: The adversary is a “yabber-blistered coil” attacking ropes, but no explicit creature name; instead the foe is an attacking coil or knot. The “quid” is warned against but unclear if a creature. Since a coil is an entity central to the conflict, though no proper name is given, \"yabber-blistered coil\" is a coined entity central to action, satisfying the criterion.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: “snicker-snack” is canonical; here we find “snitter-tuck” (similar sound), also “gargled,” “clicked,” “whistled,” “shrieking,” “squeamy,” “burfled” (coinage with sound effect); two clear onomatopoeic bursts visible (“snitter-tuck” and “gargled”), so yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Multiple stanzas show clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental, e.g. “gimbled ropes did squirm,” “squeamy spars,” “crankle-grip and glide,” “hawsepipe gargled glad,” “smog-smothered bells,” “kelpy wells gave clobbered yarms.” At least two stanzas with strong alliteration/consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning in stanza 1, preparation in stanza 2, confrontation in stanza 3, decisive action in stanza 4, return and celebration in stanzas 6-8. Arc order is respected.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line matches canonical poem exactly; all lines are original or coinage variants.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens present only in first and last stanzas: “’Twas brillig,” “mimsy” (one reference in stanza 1), but rest heavily coinage-based. Canonical tokens ≤8 in total.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: sampling lines: longer lines mostly 8–9 syllables (e.g., stanza 1 line 1: “’Twas brillig on the quiverdeck when gimbled ropes did squirm” ≈ 13 syllables is too long but some lines are shorter. Shorter lines mostly 5–7 syllables. Overall syllable adherence is uneven: some longer lines exceed 9 syllables quite a bit; the pattern is inconsistent. Thus, syllable pattern is borderline but not tight enough for a “yes.”</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: End rhymes in lines 2 and 4 vary across stanzas, and exact rhyme words are not repeated more than twice; no excessive reuse; rhyme variety acceptable.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word appears to be overused excessively besides canonical “’Twas” or “he,” which are functional; no content word exceeds 5 times or 8% threshold; good lexical variety.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages show various roots— “grinnicle,” “quiverdeck,” “fid,” “flombled,” “burfled,” “snitter-tuck,” “worrible,” “smog-smothered,” etc.—no single suffix or root dominates >50%; variety good.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses a given topic strongly implied (a nautical version of the Jabberwocky tale, with a protagonist battling an adversarial coil/knot with a fid), thus adheres to the topic (a Lewis Carroll Jabberwocky-style poem with invented coinages and similar arc).</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Beyond surface, there is implied motif of mastery over chaos/tangled knots, seamanship, patience and skill in work; also undertones of coming-of-age/heroic quest in maritime setting; thus coherent undertone present.</C24_think>\n</think>\n\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

The stubble shook;\" followed by vivid imagery of the starling flight overcoming or “taming the murmuring dark.” The decisive act is the boy’s piping and the resulting natural effect, indicating resolution.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration is present: the stanza with Granfer asking \"And hast thou tamed the murmuring dark?\" and the boy replying indicates a return and jubilant acknowledgment of the outcome.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages count: Many invented words present including “brumish,” “whiffling,” “skreebers,” “drindle,” “murmly,” “wimbled,” “swivels,” “swathes,” “brantle-skies,” “chirtling,” “wheepled,” “whewed,” “brattled,” “burlish,” “loopled,” “looled,” “lithered,” “stubbrous,” “Flaxen Throstlefox,” “gimlet eyes,” “whirrish,” “twithering,” “murmle-host,” “swivish,” “swooshed,” “sooshed,” “suthered,” “wheeples.” Easily ≥8 distinct coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coined word visible across all stanzas.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>A named non-canonical creature/entity “Flaxen Throstlefox” is introduced, clearly central to the confrontation and action.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: No clear onomatopoeic bursts like \"snicker-snack!\" or \"Pop!\" are present. Some verbs are evocative (\"wheepled,\" \"whewed,\" \"burbled\"-like), but no definite onomatopoeic exclamations identifiable.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats seen in multiple stanzas: e.g., “brumish dusk,” “whiffling dawn,” “stubbled harps do hum,” “wimbled up in swivels, swathes,” “chirtling cries,” \"brattled spark,\" \"burlish whirlwind,\" “loopled, looled,” “swivish pride,” “swooshed, sooshed, suthered,” “stubbled fields,” “granfer, glint,” showing clear alliterative consonance in at least two stanzas.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning (stanza 3), Preparation (stanza 4), Encounter (stanza 5), Decisive action (stanza 5), Return (stanzas 6, 7), Celebration (6-7). This roughly follows canonical arc sequence.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines are verbatim from the canonical poem; all wording is original.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens (jabbwocky lexicon) used: “whiffling” only canonical token; “gimlet” similar but not canonical. Canonical tokens ≤8, meets criterion favoring new coinages.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts: Longer lines mostly 9–11 syllables, shorter lines 7–8 syllables. Slightly longer but roughly consistent. However, not tight 8–9 and 5–7 syllables as in Jabberwocky. Overall syllable tightness not fully met.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes vary stanza to stanza with no exact end word reused more than twice, suggesting good rhyme variety.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No content word is clearly overused. Lexical repetition guard is respected.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages present have multiple distinct roots, suffixes are varied; no single suffix dominates >50%.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem deals with a monster-like creature and a boy confronting it with a musical magical tool in a natural setting. While not about the Jabberwock explicitly, it matches the theme of a strange creature and confrontation similar to “Jabberwocky.” Topic adherence to the challenge of a novel creature and battle is clear. It does not substitute an unrelated subject.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>The poem has a coherent implied subtext/motif about nature, unity, music’s power, overcoming darkness with light and song, and the bond between boy and sky. There is a thematic undertone beyond surface action.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Only two bursts are present (snicker-snack and burbled), sufficient to meet ≥2; so yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Within stanzas, several lines feature initial or medial consonant repetition beyond incidental.
