Also, all stanzas appear to be quatrains except possibly the last, which has 4 lines repeated as a ring echo - still 4 lines each stanza but less than 5 stanzas total. So criterion is not met.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Quatrains present, but only 4 stanzas total. Looking at line length differences to detect ballad alternating meter pattern: lines do not clearly alternate longer/shorter with ≥2 content-word difference in at least 60% stanzas. Meter is more variable, longer lines sometimes run on too long; not a clear ballad meter echo. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>In ≥60% of stanzas, the 2nd and 4th lines rhyme or slant rhyme? Checking rhyme sound patterns: \"gleamed/dreamed,\" \"mislead/creed,\" \"sought/wrought,\" \"lot/spot\" rhyme fairly well in 4th stanza. However, stanza 3's rhyme is \"lot\"/\"spot\" good, stanza 2 is \"coder/creed\" less exact but decent slant rhyme, stanza 1 is \"gleamed/dreamed.\" So 4/4 stanzas rhyme well in (2,4). No obvious AABB dominance. So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Last stanza repeats the first stanza word for word 4 lines, reconstituting the opening (though with slight variation in last two lines). It also repeats the first stanza's content words and phrases very clearly — clear ring composition. Yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition with \"Beware the Spurious-Link, my coder! The edges that mislead! Beware the Variance-clout, and shun The Phantom-centroids’ creed!\" - this is an admonition to the protagonist. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before encounter is present: \"He took his Gram-vector spear in hand; long time the max-sig sought— So rested he by the SVD, and Eigen-insight wrought.\" - clear preparation, seeking, resting. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>There is a clear encounter between protagonist and adversary: \"Then, spectral-projection thrumming, came the Sampling-Wyrmish-lot, With tentacles of noise and knell came graph-soot murk and spot!\" Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive act resolving tension: \"One, two!

More than 8 distinct coinages present, yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains ≥1 coinage: 1st has many: eigen-time, Graphomere, k-way, Node-a-bloom; 2nd: Spurious-Link, Variance-clout, Phantom-centroids; 3rd: Gram-vector, max-sig, SVD, Eigen-insight, Sampling-Wyrmish-lot; 4th: log-space-eig, beamish dweeb. Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: Spurious-Link is addressed as the adversary in the warning and fight; Sampling-Wyrmish-lot has \"tentacles of noise\" and seems also an adversary or part of encounter. The \"Spurious-Link\" clearly is named explicitly as foe. So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>At least two onomatopoeic bursts: \"snicker-snack\" (canonical from original) and \"Slice!—let clusters twixt us dance!\" (not really onomatopoeia). Only \"snicker-snack\" clearly onomatopoeic; no other burst like \"Pop\", \"Hiss\", or similar. So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration within lines/stanzas: Examples include \"Spectralclustletric Chortle-Gap\", \"tentacles of noise and knell came graph-soot murk and spot\", \"spectral-projection thrumming\" — at least two stanzas have noticeable alliteration/consonance. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning/admonition first; preparation second; encounter third; decisive action fourth; return/celebration last. Model poem matches: beware stanza; preparation stanza; encounter stanza; decisive action stanza; return stanza. Hence yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line exactly matches the canonical poem lines verbatim. The ring is repeated but is slightly altered (some lines differ from canonical). So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens are: \"beamish\", \"snicker-snack\", \"hast\", \"O\", \"frabjous\", \"Calloo\", \"Callay\", \"He\" (common word). Only 3 canonical tokens repeated (beamish, snicker-snack, O, Calloo/Callay grouped as phrase). This is ≤8 canonical tokens. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Longer lines expected around 8–9 syllables, shorter lines approx 5–7, in ballad quatrains; alternating lines. Here lines are often more irregular, and lines like stanza 1 line 1: \"'Twas eigen-time in Graphomere, and eerie spectra gleamed,\" is quite long, ~11 syllables; line 3 very long too; no clear alternating meter rhythm. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) endings are diverse across stanzas: gleamed/dreamed, mislead/creed, sought/wrought, lot/spot. None repeated more than twice. So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no obvious overuse of single content words; repeated words generally content-appropriate and within limits. No single word >5 times or >8% content words. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show multiple roots: spectral-, eigen-, sampling-, phantom-, gram-, laplace-, manifold-, spectrum-; no dominant single suffix accounting for >50%.

Some lines short but many lines slightly under 8-9. Other stanzas vary similarly; overall, syllable counts mostly tight but slightly shorter than strict 8-9 for longer lines— borderline no due to mostly 7 syllables, so no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhyme in (2,4) lines varies stanza to stanza without reusing exact end words more than twice. For example: hall/fall used twice in opening stanza and last stanza (ring), son/stun, jack/pack, brand/stand, hood/air (imperfect), snicker-snack/tag (close but imperfect), lock/joy (imperfect). No exact word reused >2 times (excluding ring). Good variety.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: Other than intended ring stanza words repeated in refrain, no content word seems overused. \"Keyringwock\" appears 4-5 times but poem is short (~140 content words), so below 5 times or 8%. No overuse of any word beyond threshold.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: At least 10 distinct coined roots seen: clang, clatter, jangle, pocket-fall, swiveling swissblade, oofy, clinking, jangling, jargled, jingle-jack, keyring-pack, keyringwock.

Come, tell me, darling boy!”  \nHe answers not, but whistles low the broken-metal alloy.  \nSo hush, my sprout, when twilight clacks and the night rails start to moan—  \nThe Deadhead always hungers; it’s your own train now, your own.", "info": {"topic": "deadhead run"}, "reward": 0.7727272727272727, "label": "medium", "criteria_yes": 17, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.7727272727272727, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>Title line present before first stanza: yes (\"The Dread-Head Rune\")</C1_think>\n<C2_think>Stanzas mostly quatrains: 13 stanzas total (all quatrains), which is above upper bound of 8, so no</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Meter alternates longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content-word difference in ≥60% of stanzas: Yes, lines show ballad-like meter with alternating lengths</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme pattern (2,4) rhyme/slant rhyme in ≥60% of stanzas, avoiding AABB dominance: Most stanzas rhyme (2,4) with some slant rhyme; AABB rare—mostly ABCB or ABAB; thus yes</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes the opening with ≥2 repeated content words or clear refrain: Final stanza recalls \"Deadhead\" and \"train,\" with thematic echo but no identical phrase repetition or exact repeated words from first stanza; no clear ring composition</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present: Yes, second stanza opens with \"Beware the Deadhead Rune, my son\"—clearly an admonition</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Protagonist prepares before confrontation (tool/resolve/wait/plan): Yes, he takes lantern, iron pass, waits at Fumble-Plath</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter between protagonist and adversary/obstacle: Yes, encounter with ghostly train described clearly</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive act resolving central tension: No decisive slaying or resolution; protagonist rides but no direct defeat of \"Deadhead Rune\"; no kill or vanquishing action described</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/homecoming and jubilant acknowledgement: No jubilant return or celebration; he returns but \"forever bound to roam,\" no joy or homecoming celebration</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Distinct invented coinages ≥8: Yes, numerous invented words such as \"tocsin tracks,\" \"cinder-crowned,\" \"Fumble-Plath,\" \"ghostly engine’s whine,\" \"clanking tomb-petals,\" \"spectered,\" \"moon-bleaching murks,\" \"ghost-fire shovel,\" \"night rails,\" \"ghostly thinned,\" \"broken-metal alloy,\" etc. Easily 8+ distinct new coinages</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains ≥1 coinage: Most stanzas contain at least one coined or nonce word; yes</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central (not Jabberwock): \"Deadhead Rune\" named centrally; train-like ghost entity distinct from canonical Jabberwock; yes</C13_think>\n<C14_think>At least 2 onomatopoeic bursts: Yes, \"clacking,\" \"shriek,\" \"hiss,\" \"throttle snapped,\" \"whistle\" (some onomatopoeic bursts); at least two clear onomatopoeic words present</C14_think>\n<C15_think>At least 2 stanzas with clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats: Yes, multiple stanzas show many alliterations (\"rail’s a-shuddering,\" \"signal towers,\" \"shivered plate,\" \"ghostly engine’s whine,\" \"pitching pistons,\" \"furnace soot\")</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order canonical (warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration): Warning, preparation, encounter clearly ordered; decisive act missing; return present but not celebration; so partially met but missing decisive act means no</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line verbatim from canonical poem: Yes, all new text, no verbatim lines from canonical</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Distinct canonical tokens ≤8: \"Beware,\" \"son,\" and \"One, two!

The poem’s lines vary in length, but mixed syllable counts and no clear longer/shorter alternating pattern apparent consistently. Partial alternation but less than 60%. No.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme in ≥60% stanzas on lines (2,4), allow slant rhyme, avoid AABB dominance: The poem rhyme scheme is mostly ABCB or ABAB variations, lines 2 and 4 generally rhyme or slant rhyme in most stanzas (around 6-7 of 9 stanzas). But stanza 3 has 8 lines complicating count. With 9 stanzas total, ≥60% is 6 needed, roughly met. Also no clear AABB dominance. So likely yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Final stanza echoes opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases or clear refrain. Final stanza references \"The settle is snug, the dark is sweet,\" but no clear strong repeated phrases from first stanza: \"’Twas hushling on the hollom rise,\" vs. \"’Twas hushling still on hollom rise,\" - partial repeat of several words but not ≥2 strong content word repeats as in canonical ring.

The badger is central, but \"badger\" is a common animal, not coined. \"mire-wumps\" might be a group. \"mire-wumps\" are named creatures - plural, but are they central? Possibly partial, but strictness calls for \"non-canonical named creature/entity central to action\" — \"burly-bill\" as a named character yes, but it's not a coined creature name.

Mixed: 1st stanza longer lines about 8-9 syllables, shorter lines 6-7 syllables.

No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety in (2,4) lines: Rhyme words are distinct; no end word repeated over twice except partial repetition in stanza 3. General good variety without over-reuse.
