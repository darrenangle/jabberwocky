However the 2nd stanza is 6 lines, and 4th stanza 4 lines but the poem contains 8 stanzas total. Majority are quatrains but not all perfectly 4 lines. Total stanza count is within 3-8. So approximate quatrain shape but not perfectly consistent.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter echo: In most stanzas lines alternate longer and shorter length with roughly 2+ content words difference. For instance the first stanza lines alternate between 5 and 7+ syllables approx. This pattern persists in majority of stanzas.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme: Most stanzas have rhyme on (2,4) lines but some rhyme is slant or consonance-based (“book”/“forsook”, “snark”/“mark”) and varies across stanzas. No evident AABB dominance as rhyme varies stanza to stanza.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza echoes the opening stanza with repeated ideas and similar words “’Twas Hilbert-time in Metamathe” and “axioms all”. It’s a ring echo with some repeated content words (“axioms”, “Symbol-men”).</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning admonition: There is an early admonition: second stanza begins with “Beware the Incompleteness-snark, my son!”. Matches early admonition criterion.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation armament: The protagonist takes their “vorpal Gödel-wrench in hand” and searches for the “Consis-doubt”, waiting thoughtfully by “ω-tree”.
