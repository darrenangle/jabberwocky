Criterion met.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Check alternate line length pattern approximately 60% of stanzas. Lines do not clearly alternate longer/shorter with ≥2 content-word difference in majority. For example, first stanza lines vary length but not strictly alternating long/short line pattern; others inconsistent.

Analyzing rhymes:  \n1: \"gyre\"/\"might\" - no rhyme  \n2: \"care\"/\"bold\" - no rhyme  \n3: \"pain\"/\"glee\" - no rhyme  \n4: \"through\"/\"perceived\" - no rhyme  \n5: \"pest\"/\"spark\" - no rhyme  \nNo consistent rhyme pattern at (2,4).

First stanzas describe the chaos, but no clear deliberate preparation by protagonist.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter with adversary: adversary named (Snorp) warned against in stanza 2, but actual encounter unclear. Later stanzas describe Reglet's riot, but no distinct meeting or confrontation scene is clearly described.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying or decisive action that resolves central tension: no clear decisive act found.

Around 8+ coinages, criterion met.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: All 5 stanzas contain at least 1 coinage or neologism (\"Reglet\" appears repeatedly, \"Snorp,\" \"Friz,\" \"Laundrecha,\" \"blether,\" \"Wuggle\"). Each stanza does have at least one. Criterion met.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: \"Snorp\" is clearly named as a creature/adversary in stanza 2; \"Reglet\" is mentioned throughout, apparently the disruptive entity. Reglet seems central to action. Criterion met.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: No obvious onomatopoeic bursts like \"snicker-snack,\" \"Pop!\", or \"Hiss!\" found. No explicit sound effects given.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Some alliteration in \"Reglets ramping,\" \"Rambunctious Ruckus,\" \"rage raging,\" but only a couple stanzas show it clearly beyond incidental repeats. At least 2 stanzas clearly have alliteration (title + stanza 1). Criterion met.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning is present early; preparation absent; no clear encounter or confrontation; no decisive act; no return/celebration. The canonical arc sequence is broken or incomplete.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line exactly matches canonical poem lines. All lines are original and altered. Criterion met.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used: \"’Twas brillig\" opener, \"mome\" once, \"wracks\" (not canonical), so canonical tokens ≤8 and limited to function words and a couple canonical nonsense words. Criterion met.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable patterns: Longer lines around 8–9 syllables? Shorter lines 5–7 syllables? Mixed; e.g., stanza 1 lines:  \nLine1: ’Twas brillig and the sloths did gyre (8)  \nLine2: In the parlour, amidst furniture dire (9)  \nLine3: Reglets ramping with ferocious might (8)  \nLine4: Did scratch and claw with fervent spite (8)  \nNo clear alternate longer/shorter line pattern; all lines fairly similar length, no clear ballad meter. Criterion not met.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Since rhyme at (2,4) is mostly absent or not consistent, rhyme variety is irrelevant; no repeated exact end words >2 times. Criterion met, but rhyme fails earlier.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No excessive repetition of any single content word. Words like \"Reglet\" appear multiple times but within reasonable count. Criterion met.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages appear varied; roughly 5+ distinct roots without dominant suffix over 50%. Criterion met.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem obviously tries to mimic Jabberwocky style focusing on a creature (\"Snorp/Reglet\") disrupting furniture. Matches the style mimic topic. Criterion met.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: No obvious strong implied motif or undertone beyond surface narrative of chaos and conflict. Viewer might detect theme of domestic disorder, but overall subtext is weak or minimal.
