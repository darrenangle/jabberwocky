Slightly borderline but no explicit meeting line. Verdict no due to lack of clear confrontation stanza.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action: The protagonist hones blade, burr dwindles and slurry yields, showing clear decisive action resolving tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Final stanza shows \"Glintle smiled, his task complete\" and \"sparkle and beam,\" a private satisfaction but no clear jubilant homecoming or return journey.

Not all stanzas have unique coinages. Verdict no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>The adversary is \"slurry,\" described as a foe but not a named creature in the sense of a non-canonical entity central to action, more like a substance pest. No named creature/entity like Bandersnatch or Jubjub besides the titular Glintle who is protagonist. Verdict no.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia burst: \"whizz and whine\" are present in stanza 3, but only one clear onomatopoeic phrase; no second onomatopoeic bursts evident. Needs ≥2.

Lines like stanza 1 line 1: \"'Twas brillig and the sloths did gyre\" ~8 syllables; line 2 \"In Glintle's shop of whirly whimsy fire\" ~9, then line 3 shorter? Less consistent alternation and syllable counts are looser than \"Jabberwocky.\" Verdict no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The (2,4) rhyme words are not repeated more than twice except no clear repeated rhymes across stanzas, except \"woe\" repeated once. Variety present. Verdict yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overused excessively. Words repeated less than ~5 times or 8% content words. Verdict yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Not many coinages or distinct roots (Glintle, glimmerwedge, whirly/whiffling related suffixes). Less than 4 distinct roots clearly coined. Verdict no.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem addresses a similar theme of a protagonist fighting an adversary (slurry) akin to the \"Jabberwocky\" theme of foe confrontation. Topic matches original poem theme on the level of a fantastical adversary challenge.

Six stanzas total, all quatrains; total stanza count between 5-8 inclusive—yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Checking meter for alternating longer/shorter lines in ≥60% of stanzas: lines mostly similar length / syllable count (e.g., stanza 1: lines roughly 8/7/8/8 syllables, no clear consistent alternate longer/shorter line pattern). No clear ≥2 content-word difference between alternating lines. Thus, no clear ballad meter echo in ≥60% stanzas—no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme: stanza 1 (heights/bright/hair/lair): rhyme on lines 2 & 4 (\"bright\"/\"lair\") is a slant rhyme at best (near-assonance), first and third lines do not rhyme.

Examples: stanza 1 (\"brillig,\" \"noctilucent\"), stanza 4 (\"nimbilisks\"), stanza 3 (\"frumious\" canonical), stanza 6 (\"slithy\"). Coinaged tokens are sparse and not in every stanza distinctly; not every stanza has a clear novel coinage—no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature named? \"Nimbilisks\" is a coined creature/entity named and somewhat central in stanza 4, but the poem is not focusing on this entity as a protagonist's antagonist—partial. However, \"nimbilisks\" appears here as a novel creature; it's non-canonical. No central clear narrative involving the creature though—borderline but leaning no since creature not central.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts?

Canonical count ≤8; no overuse—yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines ~8–9 syllables, shorter lines ~5–7. Lines mostly roughly 7–9 syllables but no clear consistent long/short alternating pattern across each stanza like Jabberwocky; syllable counts are uneven per stanza. Pattern not matched in every stanza—no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: rhymes very limited and not consistent; rhyme pairs reused or weak; no repeated exact rhyme words used >2 times but rhyme variety is poor—no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no single content word seems overused; poem is short, diverse vocabulary; no overuse of any content word—yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: few coinages total (<8), distinct roots insufficient; \"nimbilisks,\" \"noctilucent\" are distinct; others mostly standard; number below threshold—no.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem does not clearly address or narrate \"Jabberwocky\" style narrative with warning, battle, and return; more atmospheric/evocative; no evident topic adherence to Jabberwocky story or similar—no.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: poem seems descriptive of mystical clouds and twilight, no clear underlying narrative motif or undertone beyond surface imagery; no clear subtext discernible—no.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>no</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>no</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>"}

end rhymes limited and repetitive.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No overuse of any content word; repetition is low and spread out.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages are few and mainly from a single root or variation;

Total stanza count visible is 4, fewer than required minimum of 5 stanzas, and the poem does not have complete quatrains through; thus, no.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter: In the first three stanzas, lines do not strongly alternate longer and shorter with a ≥2 content-word difference in ≥60% of stanzas; overall, the meter is irregular and uneven; thus no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme (lines 2 and 4 rhyme in ≥60% of stanzas, avoiding AABB dominance): The rhyme is inconsistent; some slant rhymes present (e.g. 'law'/'gleam' weak rhyme), but rhyme does not consistently hold across stanzas; AABB pattern not indicated, but overall rhyme weak or off; no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Final stanza should clearly echo the opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words or refrains. The poem ends abruptly and incompletely, no final stanza echoes the beginning, thus no.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition: Present in stanza 2 ('Beware the frumious gizzle's maw'), clear admonition to protagonist, yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: Stanza 3 shows protagonist taking 'vorpal calipers' and acting ('To fungwarf cared each sequined hold'), suggesting preparation before confrontation, yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: No clear depiction of an encounter between protagonist and an adversary in visible text; no description of meeting or confrontation is evident. No.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: No decisive act resolving tension is present; the poem is incomplete and lacks climax. No.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: No stanza describing return or celebration is present; poem ends before such. No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Multiple distinct invented coinages present: 'Fazement', 'Movewhisper', 'whimsywhirl', 'gizzle', 'screw tarn', 'wobble stook', 'frumious', 'frabjul', 'controldream', 'fungwarf', 'sequined', 'Mazegan', 'ephemiral', suggests ≥8 distinct coinages. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: First three stanzas each contain multiple coinages; the fourth stanza truncated but includes coinage—at least 3 stanzas have coinage; however, total stanza count is less than 5, strict application means no because not all stanzas exist or have coinage. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: The poem names 'frumious gizzle' maw (creature-like entity) distinct from canonical creatures, central to the warning. Thus yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: No clear onomatopoeic bursts like 'snicker-snack', 'Pop!', 'Hiss!' visible; no onomatopoeia detected. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Some internal alliteration in lines like 'fungwarf cared each sequined hold', and 'bubbled gisp of gleam'; at least two stanzas show clear alliteration beyond incidental repeats. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning appears first, then preparation, but encounter, decisive act, and return/celebration are missing or unordered because poem is incomplete; no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: No exact canonical lines detected; words are mostly original with Juliet-correct canonical tokens replaced or mixed; yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Poem uses 'brillig', 'vorpal', 'frumious' (which is canonical adjective), others are mostly non-canonical; canonical tokens ≤8; yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Lines vary greatly; meter is irregular, some lines are longer or shorter than Jabberwocky style, no consistent ~8/6 pattern in all quatrains; no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Line end words are diverse with no repeated end word more than twice; rhyme is weak but no poor variety due to lack of repetition; yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is repeated excessively; many coinages and varied words; yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages are diverse with multiple roots and suffixes; no dominant suffix over 50%; yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem references a creature and uses similar form to Jabberwocky, but its direct topic is unclear or shifted (e.g., 'Movewhisper's state' and strange words) – the topic resemblance to Jabberwocky is implied but not explicit or clear; topic adherence is weak so no.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Lack of coherent underlying motif or discernible subtext beyond surface nonsensical action; poem is fragmented and unclear; no.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>no</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>"}

No refrain or clear echo present.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition warning is present: stanza 2 contains \"Beware the fringe...\", \"Beware the slur...\", etc., which is a clear caution to the protagonist comparable to \"Beware the Jabberwock\".</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before encounter is present: stanza 3 references honing the burr with skill and will, showing preparation (sharpening weapon or tool), which parallels the original's taking sword in hand and rest.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter present: stanza 4 describes coursing through the tulgey wood \"when galumphing Grind did cease\" and \"A razor's keen in silent peace\", implying confrontation with the adversary or obstacle.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action present: the blade \"in silent peace\" suggests the slaying or resolution; \"Mome wrackimag lies spent and cold\" also indicates aftermath of decisive action.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration absent: no stanza clearly shows a jubilant homecoming or celebration; the tone is more somber or reflective, less triumphant than canonical.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Identified coinages: \"slurry\", “hone’s”, “fedgeling”, “wrackimag”, “nith”, “vaccuo”, “frabj”, “shranger”, “frisol” among others. At least 8 distinct invented words beyond standard English and canonical lexicon; coinage count ≥8.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage word: \"slurry\", \"fringe\", \"grinder's\", \"fedgeling\", \"tulgey\", \"mome\" (canonical), \"vaccuo\", \"frabj\", \"shranger\", etc. Actually, since handful are canonical, but still each stanza has at least one novel or rare coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creature/entity: \"Grind\" is named and central to action (\"galumphing Grind\"); it is a non-canonical creature/entity involved in the encounter, fulfilling criterion.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: No clear bursts such as 'snicker‑snack!', 'Pop!', or 'Hiss!'; poem is more narrative/descriptive, lacks onomatopoeic bursts.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Clear alliteration in some stanzas: \"whetted disarray\", \"wrenches wit\", \"razor's keen in silent peace\", \"shranger penetrate\" shows consonance; at least two stanzas have such features.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Canonical arc sequence seems present: warning → preparation (sharpening burr) → encounter → decisive action (\"razor's keen\") → return/celebration (absent but some homage/reflection). Return incomplete so arc order partially met but not fully canonical due to missing clear celebration.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line verbatim matches canonical Jabberwocky; lines are all distinct in wording.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens present: \"’Twas brillig\", \"gyre\", \"gimble\", \"tulgey\", \"mome\", \"mimsy\" are canonical words used sparingly; total canonical <=8 distinct, so budget maintained.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Checking syllable tightness: lines show variability, many longer lines exceed 9 syllables or are irregular; shorter lines often 6–7 syllables but inconsistent; overall not tight syllabic control like Jabberwocky's ~8/6 alternating pattern.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: rhyme scheme somewhat mixed; some rhymes repeat but none reused more than twice excessively; variety moderate but not outstanding.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no content word overused excessively; coinages and words spread out; no evidence of overuse >5 times or >8% of content words.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages derive from at least 4 distinct roots (\"wrackimag\", \"vaccuo\", \"frabj\", \"shranger\", \"frisol\"), no single suffix dominates >50%; variety criterion met.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-like monster and protagonist’s adventure involving sharpening, confrontation, and aftermath; topic matches the Jabberwocky theme.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext present: poem has a melancholic, reflective undertone (\"lament\", \"homage he doth hold\", \"patient drain\"), suggesting theme of struggle, loss, or acceptance beyond surface action; consistent implied motif detected.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Stanza line counts: 1st stanza 4 lines, 2nd stanza 4 lines, 3rd stanza 4 lines, 4th stanza 4 lines, 5th stanza 4 lines. So all stanzas are quatrains, and number of stanzas is 5, which is within 5–8.

Yes, a warning is clearly present early on.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation is present: \"He took the vorpal upholstery's aid\" and \"fought the manx:numberish shade\" suggests gearing up and readying for confrontation. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter seems implied by fighting the 'manx:numberish shade', but the scene is vague. The poem references action but the meeting is implicit rather than sharply stated. Tentatively yes, since confrontation is described.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>There is a decisive act (\"artfully frumious swords did wield / And filed the reglet to appease and yield\") implying resolution.

Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named? The \"reglet\" is central in title and appears as an entity (\"reglet was in a test\", \"filed the reglet\"). The shade is also mentioned but \"reglet\" seems the main focus, a non-canonical creature/entity named. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia like \"snicker-snack,\" \"burbled\" are canonical but appear only in canonical poem, not here. The model poem does not include obvious onomatopoeic bursts.

Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token usage: \"brillig\", \"mimsy\", \"tulgey\", \"frumious\", \"manx\", \"galumphing\" (?), \"vorpal\", \"beamish\"? Some appear but less than 8 distinct canonical tokens used. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Longer lines generally ≈8–9 syllables but shorter lines vary more widely. Frequent awkward phrasing and uneven meter. Not tight syllabic control throughout. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme end words show some variety, with no obvious reuse more than twice (e.g., \"rest/test\", \"might/night\", and others mostly unique). Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word is clearly overused. Coinages and unique words are diverse. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages come from various roots: axelsARG, manx:numberish, bribbled, throcklepoxions, trimble, caloutgrams, Reichperiences, knath, regnish, predegree, hoheetries, grordered, rokits. At least 4 distinct roots with different suffixes. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem concerns \"reglet and furniture\" with references to furniture parts, reglet, upholstery, sofas, dust gangs, fitting the prompt.

So 5 quatrains total, which is within 5–8 range. All stanzas have 4 lines. Yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Check ballad meter, line length alternating longer/shorter with ≥2 content word difference in ≥60% of stanzas.  \n- Stanza 1 lines length: \"’Twas brillig and the sloths did gyre\" (6 content words), next line \"In the room of reglet, void of fire\" (~6 content words. Not much difference)  \n- Stanza 2: \"Beware the snizik, my son, I pray\" (6 content words), \"With claws that scratch and gimlets gray\" (6 content words). No alternating long/short pattern.  \n- Stanza 3: \"The galumphs danced upon the floor\" (5 content words), next line \"Their mimsy feet did frabjulate more\" (6 content words), difference small.  \n- Stanza 4: \"He took the vorpal blade in hand\" (6 content words), next: \"And struck the jasple with a mighty stand\" (7 content words). Again similar length.  \n- Stanza 5: \"And hast thou slain the snizik? Come to me\" (7 content words), \"And claim the whiskludean sofa, set free\" (7 content words). No clear longer/shorter pattern alternating.  \nThe alternating meter pattern is not obviously maintained in at least 3 of 5 stanzas. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Check rhyme (2,4) in ≥60% stanzas; also avoid AABB dominance.  \n- Stanza 1: rhyme between \"gyre\" and \"fire\" (lines 2 and 4), yes  \n- Stanza 2: rhyme \"pray\" and \"gray\", yes  \n- Stanza 3: rhyme \"floor\" and \"chair\" no (floor/chair no rhyme), no  \n- Stanza 4: \"hand\" and \"light\" no rhyme, no  \n- Stanza 5: \"me\" and \"free\" rhyme yes  \nSo 3/5 stanzas with rhymed (2,4), which is 60%, just hits threshold.  \nRhyme scheme distribution is mostly ABCB pattern, no dominance of AABB. So yes rhyme done well.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words/phrases or refrain?  \nOpening stanza has words like \"brillig\" and \"gyre\" etc. Final stanza (stanza 5) lines:  \n\"And hast thou slain the snizik? Come to me\"  \n\"And claim the whiskludean sofa, set free\"  \nNo repeated words/phrases from the opening stanza \"brillig\", \"sloths\", \"gyre\", \"room of reglet\" etc. No clear refrain or ring composition present. So no.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present?  \nStanza 2 starts with \"Beware the snizik, my son, I pray\" - clear warning/admonition to protagonist. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before encounter?  \nProtagonist taking \"vorpal blade in hand\" in stanza 4 suggests preparation or arming himself. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter/confrontation with adversary?  \nStanza 4 \"And struck the jasple with a mighty stand\" implies an action against an adversary named \"jasple\". Stanza 2 warns about \"snizik\" but stanza 4 attack is on \"jasple\" (different creature?). Ambiguous, but likely an encounter action present. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action resolving central tension?  \nLine \"And struck the jasple with a mighty stand\" indicates decisive strike. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return or celebration?  \nLast stanza has \"And hast thou slain the snizik? Come to me / And claim the whiskludean sofa, set free\" and \"we shall softly creep\" — no overt jubilant acknowledgement, no homecoming celebration or joy expressed. More subdued, no clear jubilance. No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented coinages (not canonical or standard English). Examples: \"snizik\", \"gimlets\", \"romanseat\", \"frabjulate\", \"wuggle\", \"jasple\", \"qTar\", \"whiskludean\". At least 8 distinct new coined words are present. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Does each stanza have at least 1 coinage?  \n- Stanza 1: sloths (English), reglet (possible coinage), yes  \n- Stanza 2: snizik (coinage)  \n- Stanza 3: galumphs (canonical but from original poem), mimsy (canonical), frabjulate (coinage), wuggle (coinage)  \n- Stanza 4: vorpal (canonical), jasple (coinage), qTar (coinage)  \n- Stanza 5: snizik (repeated), whiskludean (coinage), Flibber's Folly (title/incorporated phrase). Each stanza has at least one coinage. Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Is a non-canonical creature/entity named central to action (not Jabberwock)?  \nNamed creatures/entities: snizik and jasple. Snizik is warned about, jasple attacked. Neither canonical Jabberwock or canonical creatures. So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>At least 2 onomatopoeic bursts?  \nNo noticeable onomatopoeic words like \"snicker-snack\", \"hiss\", \"pop\" etc. present in poem. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>≥2 stanzas show clear alliteration/consonance?  \nExamples:  \n- Stanza 2: \"claws that scratch and gimlets gray\" (alliteration of 'cl' and 'gr')  \n- Stanza 3: \"galumphs danced upon the floor / Their mimsy feet did frabjulate more\" (alliteration \"frabjulate more\") maybe weak  \n- Stanza 4: \"flash and falter in the pale light\"  \nYes, clearly at least 2 stanzas show alliteration/consonance. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order (warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration)  \n- Stanza 2: warning (Beware)  \n- Stanza 4: preparation and decisive act (blade in hand, struck jasple)  \n- Stanza 5: kinda ambiguous return, but no celebration  \nEncounter implied during strike, but no clear separate stanza per encounter  \nOverall arc roughly in correct sequence. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line exactly matches canonical poem?  \nMultiple lines differ or are unique, no verbatim lines from canonical poem found. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Distinct canonical tokens ≤8?  \nCanonical tokens present include: brillig, gyre, mimsy, vorpal, galumphs? Galumph is canonical root, but \"galumphs\" (plural) likely acceptable. Up to 5 or so different canonical words, under limit. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines ~8–9 syllables and shorter lines 5–7 syllables (Jabberwocky pattern) in every stanza  \nSample:  \n- Stanza 1 line 1 \"’Twas brillig and the sloths did gyre\" = 8 syllables approx  \n- Line 2 \"In the room of reglet, void of fire\" = 8 syllables  \nLines do not clearly alternate longer/shorter per stanza consistently  \nPattern not followed in all quatrains. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) end rhymes varied; no exact end word reused >2 times excluding ring echo  \nRhymes \"gyre/fire\", \"pray/gray\", \"floor/chair\", \"hand/light\", \"me/free\" mostly unique rhyme sets. No repeated end word more than twice. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no single content word >5 times or 8% of content words outside ring echo  \nNo strong overused content words apparent. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: ≥4 distinct roots; no single suffix accounts for >50%  \nCoinages include snizik, gimlets, romanseat, frabjulate, wuggle, jasple, qTar, whiskludean - multiple distinct roots and suffixes, no dominance. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem addresses given topic clearly (Jabberwocky style poem parody, referencing creatures and events)  \nPoem follows similar style and narrative with a creature and protagonist's quest. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Coherent implied layer/motif across poem?  \nMood somewhat unclear or less developed; few metaphors or undertones, mostly surface narrative. Limited subtext.

No.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>No return or celebration present; no jubilant acknowledgement or homecoming depicted.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: many invented words like fumplen, romplen, grommets, kregloxe, ovarbiecrow, florplen, burnbletonne, gablecrest, etc. Easily ≥8 distinct invented coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Early stanzas have coinages, but later stanzas degrade into nonsense text and fragments; unclear if every stanza contains at least one coinage, especially given incoherence later. At least first 4 stanzas have coinages but later unclear. So no for all stanzas.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creatures/entities: “Reglet” is addressed as “my son” and “Wuggle” appears repeatedly, potentially a creature or place. “Reglet” is protagonist, “Wuggle” seems more place. No non-canonical creature named as foe other than possibly “Reglet.” So no clear non-canonical foe named central to action.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts like “snicker-snack” or “burbled” are absent. No clear onomatopoeic bursts detected. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Some alliteration/consonance is present in first few stanzas (e.g., “sloths did gyre,” “grommets glimmered,” “mome-like seat-legs started to enthrall”), but insufficient stanzas have this clearly beyond incidental. Only 1–2 stanzas show mild alliteration. No.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning present, preparation present, but encounter and decisive actions unclear or missing, and return celebration missing. Arc beats incomplete/incoherent and order breaks down. No.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines; although the poem starts with ’Twas brillig and some canonical words, no exact lines copied. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens within limits: brililg, mome, gyre, mome-like, outgrabe not used but “brillig,” “mome-like” used (count as coinages?), not many canonical tokens repeated more than 8 distinct tokens, so yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: individual line syllables very uneven; some lines are too long and irregular; meter is not matching ~8/6 pattern per quatrain; hence no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety poor: rhymes are rare; no obvious rhyme set or variations; (2,4) rhymes rare and unvaried; so no.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No overused single content word outside ring echo; poem’s lexicon seem broadly varied but nonsense fragments make counting difficult; safe to say yes (no overuse).</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages show multiple distinct roots: based on many invented words, roots vary; no single suffix dominates; yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem is a parody or reference to original but changes subject to “Reglet,” “Wuggle” furniture-related theme; topic is not exactly same subject as original “Jabberwock,” but reflects a similar narrative of caution and struggle; adherence partial but poem clearly within Jabberwocky styled-creature theme. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext coherence is weak due to nonsensical and fragmented later lines; no clear implied motifs or undertones maintained across poem; overall incoherent subtext. No.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>"}
