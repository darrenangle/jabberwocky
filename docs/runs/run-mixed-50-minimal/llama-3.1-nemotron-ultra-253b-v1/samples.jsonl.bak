{"i": 0, "prompt": "Write a poem about Gödel's incompleteness theorem in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about Gödel's incompleteness theorem in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\". Let me start by recalling how \"Jabberwocky\" works—it uses made-up words that sound meaningful, with a playful rhythm and rhyme scheme.\n\nFirst, I need to grasp the core ideas of Gödel's theorem. It basically states that in any formal mathematical system, there are true statements that can't be proven within that system. So, the poem needs to capture the essence of this paradox without being too technical.\n\nNow, Carroll's style often uses nonsense words and a galloping meter. I should invent some terms that relate to math concepts but sound whimsical. Words like \"borogoves\" and \"mome raths\" from the original could become things like \"numberwraiths\" or \"axiomorns\".\n\nThe structure of \"Jabberwocky\" has four-line stanzas with an ABAB rhyme scheme. I need to maintain that. Let me brainstorm some rhymes: \"theorem\" with \"cream\", \"math\" with \"path\".\n\nI should also include a narrative, like a journey through a mathematical realm, encountering strange creatures (metaphors for axioms, proofs, etc.). The protagonist might struggle with these creatures, symbolizing the incompleteness.\n\nPotential lines: \"Beware the Numberwraith, my son! / The axioms, they breed and spawn\" – something like that. Then introduce Gödel's \"sentence of gloom\" that's true yet unprovable.\n\nNeed to ensure the made-up words are consistent and the rhythm flows. Testing each line's syllable count to match the original's cadence. For example, \"He took the Vorpal Code in hand\" – \"Vorpal\" from Carroll, \"Code\" relates to formal systems.\n\nEnding with the theorem's impact: \"A truth that mocks the formal creed— / No system's wholly complete!\" That ties back to the theorem's conclusion.\n\nLet me piece it together, stanza by stanza, checking rhyme and rhythm. Once the structure is right, refine the jargon-blended verse to capture both the whimsy and the mathematical depth.\n</think>\n\n**\"The Gödelwcky\"**  \n\n’Twas glimsy in the mathemaze,  \nWhere axioms breed, then pause to sneeze—  \nAll frabjul proofs in rows they’d daze,  \nWhile theorems frolicked, fierce with freeze.  \n\n“Beware the Numberwraith, my son!  \nThe slithy algorithms strike at noon.  \nBeware the mome raths of Is-Not-Done,  \nAnd shun the frumious Boolean Boon!”  \n\nHe took the Vorpal Code in hand,  \nTo slay the Wraith with logic’s might.  \nHe searched for truths in symbol-land,  \nBut found a sentence, dark as night.  \n\n“Thy system’s strong, yet flawed within!”  \nThe Wraith burbled in gleeful Greek.  \n“Though all thy proofs may dance and spin,  \nA truth remains that thou canst not speak.”  \n\nHe looped through labyrinths of the sign,  \nHe grappled with the predicate’s fang—  \nBut oh! The paradox divine  \nThat gaped where consistency did bang.  \n\n’Tis a theorem of subtle dread—  \nA truth that mocks the formal creed—  \nNo system’s wholly complete, nor said…  \nThe mathemaze writhes, unsheathed, ahead.  \n\nSo if thy mind would grapple there,  \nWhere Gödel’s shadow soft doth play,  \nHeed this: some truths float, beyond compare,  \nUncaught, like frabjul fronds in May.", "info": {"topic": "Gödel's incompleteness theorem"}, "reward": 0.9090909090909091, "label": "high", "criteria_yes": 20, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.9090909090909091, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>Title is present as \"The Gödelwcky\" before the first stanza; non-empty and separate from stanza text.</C1_think>\n<C2_think>There are 7 stanzas, all quatrains (4 lines each); total stanza count within 3–8 range.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Lines alternate longer/shorter with content-word difference roughly matching Jabberwocky in at least 5 of 7 stanzas (~71%), so yes.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>In ≥5 of 7 stanzas (about 71%) lines 2 and 4 rhyme or near rhyme (\"sneeze/freeze\", \"noon/boon\", \"might/night\", \"Greek/speak\", \"fang/bang\"); no excessive AABB patterns; rhyme fits ballad style.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes the theme of the first stanza (mathemaze, frabjul), but no explicit repeated content words or exact phrases as ring; thematic echo only, barely meets minimal ring standard.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present: stanza 2 opens with \"Beware the Numberwraith, my son!\" which matches a clear admonition.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Protagonist prepares before confrontation by taking \"the Vorpal Code in hand\" and seeking truths, matching tool/resolve preparation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear confrontation present: encounter with \"Numberwraith\", \"slithy algorithms\", and the difficult \"sentence of gloom\"; the adversary or obstacle is conceptualized as Numberwraith and paradox.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action is less physical but metaphorical - protagonist tries to \"slay the Wraith with logic’s might\" and \"grappled with the predicate’s fang\"; though no physical slaying, there is a central decisive struggle depicted.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return or homecoming is weak; final stanza is a cautionary reflection rather than jubilant acknowledgement; no clear celebratory return scene like original poem.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Counted distinct invented coinages: glimsy, mathemaze, frabjul, Numberwraith, mome raths (reused canonical mome?), Boolean Boon, Vorpal Code (vorpal is canonical but here compounded), burbled (canonical), fronds (normal), plus few invented blends/coinages e.g. frabjul, mathemaze; more than 8 new coinages present?

{"i": 1, "prompt": "Compose a poem on shortest path in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about the shortest path, styled like \"Jabberwocky\" with a title. Let me start by recalling the key elements of \"Jabberwocky.\" It's known for its nonsense words, playful language, and whimsical creatures, even though it has a rhythm and structure that's serious, like a quest narrative.\n\nSo, the challenge is to blend the technical concept of the shortest path—probably related to graph theory or algorithms—with the fantastical, made-up language of Carroll's poem. I need to create neologisms that evoke both the mathematical and the mystical.\n\nFirst, the title. \"Jabberwocky\" has a title that's a nonsense word. Maybe something like \"The Snicker-Snack\" or \"Beware the Bellman-Ford.\" Wait, Bellman-Ford is an algorithm for shortest paths. But maybe make it more whimsical. \"The Quaoar-Quire\" or \"The Frumious Path.\" Hmm, \"Frumious\" is from the original. Maybe \"The Frumious Route\" or \"The Jabbal-Path.\"\n\nNow, the poem structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has four-line stanzas with an ABAB rhyme scheme. I need to maintain that. Let's outline the journey of finding the shortest path with challenges, using made-up words that hint at graphs, nodes, edges, weights, maybe mazes.\n\nIn the original, there's a call to action (\"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!\") and a narrative of overcoming obstacles. The protagonist uses a vorpal sword. For the shortest path, the tools might be algorithms (like Dijkstra's or A*), heuristics, avoiding loops or heavy edges.\n\nI should create creatures or obstacles: \"Beware the Cycle-Beast,\" \"Heed the Weighted Edges' wrath,\" \"the Null-Loops that mire the way.\" Use terms like \"nodes of might,\" \"vertices,\" \"graphs,\" \"edges shine,\" \"algorithms,\" \"heuristic spell,\" \" expanding frontiers,\" \"greedy branches,\" \" Boruvka's brook,\" \"FibHeap's mystic swirl.\"\n\nNeed to include a moment of triumph: reaching the target node, the shortest path found. Maybe a stanza about the algorithm's efficiency, avoiding the \"Infinite's snare.\" End with a flourish, similar to \"Jabberwocky\"'s conclusion.\n\nCheck for rhythm. Each line should have about 8 syllables, with a trochaic tetrameter. Use alliteration and invented words that sound technical but magical. Ensure the rhymes fit naturally. Let me draft some lines:\n\nBeware the Bellman's endless quest,\nWhere edges loop and weights find rest...\nWait, not quite. Maybe:\n\nBeware the Cycle-Beast, my son,\nThe Null-Loops that mire the way are done!\nBut \"done\" might not make sense. Alternatively:\n\nWith Algorithms of old repute,\nWe weigh each edge, each node compute...\n\nHmm.

Then, incorporate Carroll's style with invented words. Words like \"slath,\" \"mome,\" \"galumphing\" come to mind. Need to create similar neologisms related to grinding or hollowness.\n\nStart with a title that fits the theme. \"The Hollow Grind's Slithy Sway\" uses \"slithy,\" a Carroll portmanteau of \"slimy\" and \"lithe.\" That's a good start. The first stanza should set the scene, maybe with a warning about the Hollow Grind. Use alliteration and nonsense verbs.\n\nNext, describe the Grind itself. Give it some fantastical characteristics.

Incorporate words like \"gralloch\" (a real term for animal innards, but used here poetically) and \"glintzen\" as a made-up action. \n\nIntroduce a protagonist who confronts the Grind.

Carroll uses made-up words, playful language, and a whimsical yet adventurous tone. The structure includes rhyming verse, often with a consistent meter.\n\nSo, the task is to blend the whimsy and neologisms of \"Jabberwocky\" with the imagery of a cedar chest. The title should be catchy and alliterative, maybe something like \"The Cedar Chest's Gallivant\". \n\nI need to incorporate nonsense words that evoke the scent, age, and mystical qualities of cedar. Words like \"snicker-snack\" from the original could inspire terms like \"glintzen\" or \"murmle\". The cedar chest should be portrayed as a living, magical entity. \n\nThe poem should have a narrative, perhaps a journey or battle, but centered around the chest. Maybe the protagonist encounters the chest in a whimsical setting, interacts with it, and discovers its secrets. Each stanza should flow with a rhythm similar to \"Jabberwocky\", using AABB rhyme scheme. \n\nI should also include vivid, fantastical descriptions. For example, \"scent of ages, crisp and chill\" ties the cedar's aroma to an immersive experience. Adding mythical elements like \"moonmice\" or \"ghostmoths\" enhances the fantastical feel. \n\nFinally, ensure the poem has a satisfying conclusion, where the chest's magic is revealed, inviting the reader to partake in its timeless world.

Let me recall that 'Jabberwocky' by Lewis Carroll uses a lot of nonsense words but still conveys vivid imagery and a narrative. So I need to capture that whimsical, playful language with made-up terms while keeping the theme centered on the harvest moon.\n\nFirst, the title should be catchy and have a similar ring to 'Jabberwocky'. Maybe something like \"The Harvest Moon's Glibblejaws\" to incorporate a nonsense word. Next, think about the structure—quatrains with a consistent rhyme scheme, probably ABAB. \n\nNow, elements of the harvest moon: full moon, autumn, harvest, maybe nocturnal creatures, farm activities. But need to twist them into fantastical terms. Words like \"glibblejaws\" could represent something magical happening under the moon. Use alliteration and playful verbs. \n\nIn 'Jabberwocky', Carroll uses compound words and invented creatures. So I'll create similar terms, like \"mimsy marmalade\" or \"snicker-snack\". Need to ensure the poem has a sense of wonder and motion, maybe a journey or action under the moonlight. Incorporate the idea of harvesting, but in a whimsical way—maybe \"fetch the silver scythes of dew\" instead of regular tools. \n\nCheck the rhythm, each line should have a similar meter, probably iambic tetrameter. Read through lines to ensure they flow. Add some conflict or challenge, like \"Beware the Frumious Brume\" to introduce a slight obstacle before resolving with the harvest's joy. \n\nEnd with a flourishing conclusion that ties back to the moon's majesty and the completed harvest.

The protagonist might face personified elements of the desert. I need to invent creatures or terms related to sand. Words like \"glazzle,\" \"snicker-Sphinx,\" \"vawtle,\" \"mome-wracks\" could work. These should evoke the swirling, harsh environment.\n\nJabberwocky uses refrains like \"Beware the...\" so I should include warnings about the dangers of the sand. Include actions like the sand moving, biting, stinging. The rhythm needs to be consistent, each line with eight syllables and a clear stress pattern.\n\nI should start with setting the scene, maybe at dusk or dawn when winds pick up. Introduce the fantastical elements early. The middle stanzas can build tension with the sand's ferocity, then a climax where the sandstorm peaks, and a resolution where the danger passes, leaving the dunes changed.\n\nCheck for alliteration and internal rhymes.

I need to capture that whimsical and fantastical tone but focus on a rubber band.\n\nFirst, the title. The original uses \"Jabberwocky,\" which is a nonsense word. Maybe something like \"The Frumious Bandalore\" to keep the whimsical feel. \"Frumious\" is a blend of \"fuming\" and \"furious\" from the original, and \"Bandalore\" sounds like a fantasy term for a rubber band.\n\nNext, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has a consistent meter and rhyme scheme. Each stanza is four lines with an ABAB rhyme scheme. I'll need to maintain that. Let me think of some invented words related to rubber bands. Words like \"flibuljibits\" for the tiny bits that hold things, \"snicker-snack\" from the original can be used for cutting, but maybe modify it to \"snickering snap\" when it breaks.\n\nImagery is important. The rubber band as a creature or a magical item. Maybe it's discovered in a strange place, like \"tulgey woods\" from the original becomes \"gloom of a drawer\" where it's found. The band's abilities: stretching, holding, snapping back. Use vivid descriptions, like \"eyes of elastic ire\" to give it a life-like quality.\n\nInclude some conflict, like in \"Jabberwocky\" where the protagonist battles the beast. Maybe the rubber band fights against being stretched too far, leading to its demise with a \"snickering snap.\" After its snapping, it leaves behind remnants, \"flibuljibits of its core,\" which could be the small pieces left when it breaks.\n\nEnsure the language is playful and alliterative, with made-up verbs and nouns. Check the rhythm of each line to match the original's iambic tetrameter. Read each stanza aloud to test the flow. Make sure the made-up words are consistent and fit within the poem's logic, even if they're nonsense.\n\nFinally, wrap it up with a moral or reflection, similar to the original's ending. Maybe the speaker learns about the rubber band's nature, advising caution when handling such whimsical yet fragile things.

{"i": 9, "prompt": "Write a poem about something forgotten in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem in the style of \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll, with a title, about something forgotten. Let me recall the features of \"Jabberwocky.\" It's known for its nonsense words, playful language, and a rhythmic flow. The structure is quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme.\n\nFirst, I need a title that's catchy and has a similar invented-word feel. Maybe \"The Frumplenax\" – sounds whimsical and Carroll-esque. The main subject should be something forgotten, so the Frumplenax could be an obscure creature or object that's been lost to time.\n\nNext, the poem needs a narrative. Introduce the Frumplenax in a setting, maybe a vague, dreamlike landscape. Use made-up verbs and nouns to create that nonsense feel. Include actions and a sense of mystery. The refrain \"Beware the Frumplenax, my son!\" mirrors \"Beware the Jabberwock\" to tie it to the original style.\n\nIncorporate Carroll's techniques like portmanteaus and alliteration. Words like \"slithy\" from \"Jabberwocky\" combine \"slimy\" and \"lithe.\" Maybe \"momeflax\" or \"grimbulge\" could be similar blends. Ensure each stanza progresses the story, perhaps leading to the Frumplenax's disappearance or the protagonist's forgetfulness.\n\nCheck the rhythm: each line is roughly tetrameter, with a steady beat. Use hyphenated words to adjust meter where needed. End with the Frumplenax being forgotten, tying back to the theme. Make sure the last stanza loops back to the title, emphasizing its forgotten nature.\n</think>\n\n**The Frumplenax**  \n\n'Twas brillumoon, and the sloths were still,  \nNot raving, nor ranting, nor burbling free—  \nAll whims were packed in the Wash of Whill,  \nAnd the Wizzle was coiled in the Wumplen tree.  \n\n\"Beware the Frumplenax, my son!  \nThe jaws that chort and the claws that glint—  \nBeware the Jubjub’s fierce frumious stun,  \nAnd shun the gumfledge with spikes within!\"  \n\nHe took the vorpal crunk in hand—  \nLong 'twas he'd sought through the Throcklepox dell.  \nWhen the Hifflewumps hoot, and the flums frazzle and stand,  \nHe slew the beast with a flick and a yell.  \n\nYet now, in the morn's mimsy glow,  \nWhen dew dips the fronds of the Flishalax—  \nNo soul can recall what the Frumplenax knows,  \nFor all its tale's lost in the Slithybax.  \n\nAnd whether 'twas here, or there, or then,  \nNo momeflax map marks its grimbulge sleep—  \n'Tis the snick of time that was ne'er to begin,  \nThe Frumplenax slipped where the shadows creep.", "info": {"topic": "something forgotten"}, "reward": 0.0, "label": "very_low", "criteria_yes": 0, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.0, "C1_title_present": 0.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 0.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 0.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 0.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 0.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 0.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 1.0}, "judge_raw": null}
{"i": 10, "prompt": "Compose a poem on falling leaves in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about falling leaves in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" Let me recall that \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll uses a lot of nonsense words that sound meaningful. So I need to invent playful, whimsical language that still conveys the imagery of autumn leaves.\n\nFirst, I should brainstorm some nonsense verbs and nouns related to falling leaves. Words like \"flumplenax,\" \"sliveling,\" \"gallywump\" – they need to have a certain rhythm and alliteration common in the original poem. Also, Lewis Carroll often uses compound words, so maybe create terms like \"snicker-snack\" but adapted to leaves.\n\nNext, structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has a consistent rhyme scheme and meter, usually ABAB quatrains with anapestic tetrameter. I need to maintain that rhythm. Let me outline the flow: introduce the setting with fantastical elements, then describe the leaves' movement, add some conflict or action (maybe the leaves dance or battle), and conclude with the scene fading into dusk.\n\nImagery is key. Use words that evoke motion and color without being literal. Instead of saying \"leaves fall,\" use \"leaves gyre\" or \"twirl.\" Incorporate creatures or forces that interact with the leaves, maybe personifying wind or having mythical beasts like \"gallywumps\" that chase the leaves.\n\nRhyming words might be challenging. Let me jot down possible rhymes for each stanza. The first stanza ends with day and say, so words that rhyme with those. Next stanzas need to follow the ABAB pattern. Invented words can help here, as they don't need to make literal sense but should fit phonetically.\n\nAlso, include some alliteration: \"frabjous flora,\" \"glibbergloul,\" \"mome,\" \"tulgey.\" These add to the whimsical feel. Make sure each stanza moves the action forward, building up the scene to a crescendo and then a calm ending.\n\nCheck for meter consistency. Each line should have four beats with unstressed syllables before the stressed ones. For example, \"Beware the Flumplenax, my son!\" has the stress on Flump-len-ax, my son. That works.\n\nNow, draft each stanza step by step, ensuring the nonsense words contribute to the imagery and the rhythm stays true. Revise any lines that stumble or don't fit the meter. Read it aloud to test the flow.\n\nFinally, ensure the title fits the \"Jabberwocky\" style, something like \"The Flumplenux's Frabjous Fall\" to include invented words and the theme.

{"i": 12, "prompt": "Write a poem about hiraeth in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about hiraeth in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\". Let me start by recalling what hiraeth means. It's a Welsh concept, a deep longing or homesickness for something that no longer exists or may never have been. So, the poem needs to capture that bittersweet, nostalgic feeling.\n\nNow, the style of \"Jabberwocky\" is characterized by made-up words, playful language, and a whimsical rhythm. Carroll invents words that sound real but aren't, which adds to the fantastical and mysterious atmosphere. I need to mimic that structure, using nonsense words to convey the essence of hiraeth without being too direct.\n\nFirst, the title. \"Jabberwocky\" uses a nonsense word, so maybe something like \"Hiraethwack\" or \"The Hiraeth's Lament\". Wait, let me think. It should have a similar ring to it. Maybe \"The Hiraethwack\" to match \"Jabberwocky\". But maybe the user wants the title to reference the concept more clearly. Alternatively, \"In Hiraeth's Hollow\" could work. Hmm.\n\nNext, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has a consistent meter, mostly trochaic tetrameter. Each stanza is four lines with an ABAB rhyme scheme. I need to maintain that rhythm and rhyme scheme. Let me sketch out a first stanza.\n\n\"Beware the Hiraethwack, my son!  \nThe jaws that bite, the claws that latch,  \nBeware the Slithyfrumious stun  \nBeneath the mistle-mournful thatch.\"  \n\nWait, \"Slithyfrumious\" combines \"slithy\" (from Carroll) with \"frumious\" (another Carroll portmanteau). That works. Then, \"mistle-mournful thatch\" evokes a mournful, misty setting, fitting for hiraeth.\n\nNow, introducing the hiraeth itself. Maybe personify it as a creature or a force. In \"Jabberwocky\", the protagonist battles the beast. Here, the battle might be internal—longing vs. moving on.\n\nInclude some Carroll-esque creatures or terms. For example, \"mome raths\" or \"jabberwock\" itself. But make them relate to hiraeth. Maybe \"the mome wraiths\" or \"the frumious Bandersnatch\". Wait, need to tie them to the theme.\n\nStanzas 2-3: Setting the scene, maybe a landscape that reflects hiraeth—twilight, shadows, echoes. Use words that sound like Welsh maybe? Or at least mystical.\n\n\"Twilight brims with sullen gleam,  \nWhere shadowthorns in silence climb—  \nBeware the Hiraethwack’s soft scream,  \nAs moonmurmurs drown out time.\"  \n\nYes, \"shadowthorns\" and \"moonmurmurs\" create a melancholic, eerie atmosphere. \"Drown out time\" connects to hiraeth's timeless longing.\n\nThen, the encounter with Hiraethwack. In \"Jabberwocky\", the battle is physical, but here it's emotional. The protagonist must confront the longing.\n\n\"He took the vorpal sword in hand—  \nA blade forged when remembrance sighs—  \n’Long has this heart my soul withstood,  \nYet still the Hiraethwack denies!’\"  \n\n\"Vorpal sword\" is a direct reference. The blade made from remembrance ties into the theme. The exclamation shows determination against the longing.\n\nThe climax where the protagonist defeats the Hiraethwack, but maybe it's a pyrrhic victory. In \"Jabberwocky\", the beast is slain, but here, the longing might linger.\n\n\"He struck with all his might and main—  \nA glimmer! Then a fading spark—  \nThe Hiraethwack dissolved to rain,  \nLeaving naught but absence dark.\"  \n\nDissolving to rain is a good image for something ephemeral. \"Absence dark\" shows that even after confronting hiraeth, the void remains.\n\nFinally, the aftermath. Did defeating hiraeth bring peace or just emptiness? Maybe ambiguity, as in Carroll's poem.\n\n\"Back through the glimmerglass he strayed,  \nThe dawn’s keen edge began to bite—  \n‘Did I but dream the Hiraethwack?’  \nHe sighed, and vanished in the light.\"  \n\n\"Glimmerglass\" is from \"Through the Looking-Glass\". The questioning whether it was a dream leaves it open, fitting the complexity of hiraeth.\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme: ABAB throughout. Meter is mostly consistent. Made-up words are woven in. The progression from warning to battle to aftermath mirrors \"Jabberwocky\" but with the theme of hiraeth. I think this works. Let me put it all together with the title and see if it flows.\n</think>\n\n**The Hiraethwack**  \n\nBeware the Hiraethwack, my son!  \nThe jaws that bite, the claws that latch,  \nBeware the Slithyfrumious stun  \nBeneath the mistle-mournful thatch.  \n\nTwilight brims with sullen gleam,  \nWhere shadowthorns in silence climb—  \nBeware the Hiraethwack’s soft scream,  \nAs moonmurmurs drown out time.  \n\nHe grasped the sword of fractured light—  \nA blade forged when remembrance sighs—  \n“Long has this ache my soul withstood,  \nYet still the Hiraethwack denies!”  \n\nHe charged through thorns of yesteryear,  \nWhere phantom winds in whispers thrall,  \nThe beast arose, all tears, all sneer,  \nIts form a flicker, then a squall.  \n\nHe struck with vigor, struck with spite!  \nThe glimmerstench of dawn broke cold—  \nThe Hiraethwack collapsed to blight,  \nA mirage his grip could mold.  \n\nBack through the glimmerglass he strayed,  \nThe dawn’s keen edge began to bite—  \n“Did I but dream the Hiraethwack?”  \nHe sighed, and vanished in the light.", "info": {"topic": "hiraeth"}, "reward": 0.0, "label": "very_low", "criteria_yes": 0, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.0, "C1_title_present": 0.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 0.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 0.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 0.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 0.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 0.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 1.0}, "judge_raw": null}
{"i": 13, "prompt": "Compose a poem on proofing basket in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about a proofing basket in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Let me recall that 'Jabberwocky' by Lewis Carroll is known for its nonsensical words, playful language, and rhythmic verse. So I need to capture that whimsical, fantastical feel but apply it to a proofing basket, which is a real thing used in baking for letting dough rise.\n\nFirst, I should think about the key elements of a proofing basket. It's usually made of wicker or some woven material, it's used for bread dough, maybe linen-lined, helps create a pattern on the bread. The process involves waiting, rising, maybe some warmth and moisture. Now, how to translate these into the Jabberwocky style with made-up words and playful language.\n\nThe title should be something like \"The Proofenwocky\" to blend \"proofing\" with \"Jabberwocky\". Then, the structure: quatrains with a consistent meter, probably trochaic tetrameter. Carroll uses a lot of alliteration and portmanteau words. I need to invent some terms related to baking but in a whimsical way.\n\nThink about the verbs and nouns. Instead of \"gyre\" and \"gimble\", maybe \"sough\" and \"splay\". The proofing basket could be personified as a creature that the baker must manage. Maybe the dough is a beast that needs taming. The process of rising could be a battle or a dance.\n\nIncorporate some baking terms but twist them. Words like \"flour-fanged\", \"yeastly\", \"crumb labyrinth\", \"crustcrafty\". The basket's role in shaping the bread, the waiting time, the environment needed for proofing. Maybe some obstacles like over-proofing or under-proofing, depicted as monsters.\n\nRhyme scheme should follow ABAB. Each stanza tells a part of the journey: preparing the dough, placing it in the basket, the rising process, the final bake. Use alliteration and assonance to keep the rhythm lively.\n\nCheck for consistency in meter and made-up words that still hint at their meaning. Ensure it captures the essence of both the proofing basket and the Jabberwocky's nonsense style. Maybe end with a triumphant loaf, showing the success of the process.\n</think>\n\n**The Proofenwocky**  \n\n’Twas morn, and all the loaves did sough,  \nThe racks in wickered wrath did play—  \n“Beware the Yeastjaws, my young Chef,  \nThe Splayclaw, frumious, grey!”  \n\nHe packed the whorl of wheaten might,  \nThe slab of buttery, blobulous dough;  \nOne, two! One, two!

'Jabberwocky' by Lewis Carroll is known for its nonsense words, playful language, and whimsical creatures. It has a rhythmic structure, often using trochaic tetrameter.\n\nFirst, the title needs to sound whimsical and rhyme with \"key ring.\" \"Frabjulet's\" has a Carroll-esque feel, and \"Sing-Ree\" plays on \"key ring.\" Good start.\n\nNext, the setting. The original has \"far and away.\" Maybe start with \"Beware the Frabjulet’s jing...\" using alliteration and nonsense verbs like \"jinkle-wiff\" and \"flum.\" \n\nIncorporate key ring elements. Keys can be metaphorically linked to opening things, maybe a quest. The \"vorpal blade\" in Jabberwocky becomes \"Vorpal key\" here. Need to add fantastical challenges: \"Jim-jam locks\" and \"mome wrath\" (from \"mome\" in the original). \n\nRhythm check. Each line should have four stressed syllables. Let me read through the draft to ensure the meter matches. \n\nInclude a narrative: slaying a monster (Burble-wock) with the key, retrieving something (shrieking door), and returning home. End with a playful twist, like waking up from a dream, similar to the original's structure. \n\nEnsure nonsense words fit naturally and convey the action. Playful language is key. Words like \"galumphing\" and \"frumious\" from the original can inspire terms like \"flibbertijibits\" and \"jubjub.\" \n\nCheck the rhyme scheme, mostly AABB. \"Sing-Ree\" as the key ring's name adds a personal touch. \n\nFinal read-through for flow and whimsy. Adjust any lines that feel forced. Make sure it captures the essence of a key ring's journey in a fantastical world, mirroring the adventure in Jabberwocky.\n</think>\n\n**\"Frabjulet’s Sing-Ree\"**  \n\nBeware the Frabjulet’s *jing*, my son,  \nThe jaws that *clink* and the claws that *sprung*;  \nBeware the *flum*’s frumious fray,  \nAnd shun the *jim-jam*’s mome wrath by day.  \n\nWe took the *Vorpal* key in hand—  \nLong had the *Burble-wock* vexed the land—  \nAnd *galumphed* where the *flibbertijibits* play,  \nTo vanquish locks and seize the fray.  \n\nThe *Gleeblarp* gnashed with goblin glee,  \n“Your Sing-Ree’s might is all *fimbulfly*!”  \nBut *whiffling* through the *tulgey* wood,  \nWe *burble*-cracked the demon’s mood.  \n\n“*Froth* and *fizzle*!” the beast did roar,  \nAs keys a-*jinkle* split its core—  \nThe *jubjub*’s shriek, the door’s loud *clang*—  \nOur quest’s end, all *wizzle-whacked* and *sang*.  \n\nWe *flurled* home, where *mimsy* moons grin,  \nThe Sing-Ree’s *glare* out-*glibbed* the spin—  \nYet, lo!

It's full of nonsense words, playful language, and a rhythmic structure. Carroll uses made-up words that sound meaningful, creating a whimsical and adventurous feel.\n\nFirst, I need a title that's catchy and fits the theme. Maybe something like \"The Candlewock's Frumious Day\" to blend \"candle\" with a \"Jabberwocky\" twist. Now, the poem should tell a story with a beginning, middle, and end. The birthday candle is the main character, so I'll personify it. \n\nIn the original, the protagonist faces challenges like the Jabberwock. For the candle, maybe the challenge is staying lit despite obstacles. I'll need to create some creatures or problems for the candle to overcome. Words like \"snicker-snacks\" or \"vorpal\" come to mind. Let me invent some terms: \"Fizzlejaws\" could be something that tries to blow out the flame, \"Snuffler\" as a threat. \n\nThe rhyme scheme of \"Jabberwocky\" is ABAB, with a consistent meter. I should follow that. Start with setting the scene: a birthday scene, the cake as a landscape. Then introduce the candle's quest to keep burning. Include some action where the candle faces these made-up creatures. Use alliteration and playful language. \n\nCheck for rhythm and meter. Each line should have around 8 syllables. Let me draft a stanza: \"'Twas brillig on the cake so fine, / The frosting peaks in twisted spin. / 'Beware the Fizzlejaws,' I'd whine, / 'And shun the Snuffler's gust within!'\" Hmm, \"frosting peaks\" and \"twisted spin\" gives a sense of a fantastical cake. \n\nNext, the candle's journey: \"I took the taper, vorpal bright,\" using \"vorpal\" from the original. The flame dances, outwits the Fizzlejaws, maybe by melting wax. Then the climax where the candle triumphs, and the celebration ends with blowing it out, but its memory stays. \n\nEnsure the made-up words fit the rhythm and the story flows. Read it aloud to check the flow. Adjust any lines that stumble. Add a closing stanza that mirrors the end of \"Jabberwocky\", maybe about the candle's legacy.

{"i": 17, "prompt": "Create a poem about deadhead run in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about a \"deadhead run\" in the style of \"Jabberwocky\". First, I need to recall what \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll is like. It's known for its nonsense words and playful language, with a rhythmic meter and vivid, whimsical imagery. So the challenge is to capture that essence while incorporating the theme of a deadhead run.\n\nNext, understanding \"deadhead run\". From what I remember, in the context of trains or transportation, a deadhead run refers to moving an empty train or a crew moving without passengers, typically for repositioning. There's a sense of something in motion but not fully active or productive. Maybe there's a bit of melancholy or a eerie stillness to it.\n\nNow, blending these two. The poem needs to have made-up words that sound like they fit the rhythm of the original. Words like \"slithy\", \"mome\", \"galumphing\" in Jabberwocky. So I should invent similar-sounding terms related to trains or movement. Also, maintaining the ABAB rhyme scheme and the trochaic tetrameter rhythm.\n\nPossible structure: Start with a warning or an instruction, like \"Beware the...\" similar to the original's \"Beware the Jabberwock\". Then introduce the concept of the deadhead run with invented vocabulary. Maybe use metaphors related to rails, engines, motion without purpose. Incorporate fantastical elements, like creatures or strange machinery.\n\nNeed to ensure the poem flows smoothly and each stanza connects. Think of the action of the deadhead run—moving through tracks, perhaps at night, with a sense of solitude. Use alliteration and assonance to keep it musical. Check the meter by reading aloud, even if just mentally.\n\nAlso, make the title catchy and in line with Jabberwocky's style. Maybe something like \"The Deadhead's Galumph\" or \"Beware the Deadhead Run\". The original uses \"Jabberwocky\" as the title, so perhaps a similar possessive or descriptive title.\n\nLastly, review for any forced rhymes or spots where the meter stumbles. Revise as needed to maintain the whimsical yet rhythmic feel of Carroll's work, while effectively portraying the deadhead run concept through inventive language.\n</think>\n\n**The Frabjulon Freight**  \n\nBeware the deadhead’s dolorous hum,  \nThat drones where rivets weep and fray,  \nA grackle Gus in goggles comes—  \n“Beware the railyard’s frabjulay!”  \n\n‘Tis chuff nor pill that wrecks the line,  \nThe rackers prance with cogs aglow,  \nBut flums that snick in loops of twine—  \nSo shun the mulligrubs’ low blow.  \n\nThrough ulva swamps of rusted track,  \nWhere mimsy servos yap and spit,  \nThe deadhead runs with 关 jammed back—  \nNo thockles, just a ghosted flit.  \n\n“O frumious freight!” the brake pipes keen,  \nAs stokers feed the grog with zeal,  \nThe moorhens leap from gantries green—  \nA mome of slack, the wheels reveal.  \n\nYet still the zephyrs romp and boom,  \nWhile dormice shift the switcher’s spleen,  \nFor every schlock must find its room…  \nSo frizzle on, thou jinx of sheen!  \n\nThe vorpal gauge—O keep it tight!  \nThen galumph off, ye shunting brave—  \nFor all NIGHT’S DEADHEAD RUNS must plight…  \n*A Borogove’s clank, a            \n            \n(There’s glory in the empty car,  \nWhere bricoles bleat and rail meets rail—  \nTo mimsify or mimsify not?  \nThe twickler’s tale… the twickler’s trail.)", "info": {"topic": "deadhead run"}, "reward": 0.0, "label": "very_low", "criteria_yes": 0, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.0, "C1_title_present": 0.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 0.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 0.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 0.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 0.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 0.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 1.0}, "judge_raw": null}
{"i": 18, "prompt": "Write a poem about spectral clustering in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about spectral clustering in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\". Let me start by recalling the key elements of \"Jabberwocky\". It's known for its nonsense words, playful language, and rhythmic meter, often using made-up terms that sound meaningful. The structure is quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme and a trochaic tetrameter rhythm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what spectral clustering is. From what I remember, it's a technique used in machine learning for clustering data points. It involves projecting the data into a lower-dimensional space where clusters become more apparent, using eigenvectors of a similarity matrix. Terms like \"graph Laplacian\", \"eigenvectors\", \"similarity matrix\", and \"dimensions\" are relevant here.\n\nNow, the challenge is to blend these technical terms into a whimsical, Carroll-esque poem. I should create nonsense words that hint at the concepts. For example, \"spectral\" could become \"Spectralfar\", \"eigenvectors\" might be \"Eigenblades\" or \"Eigenstalk\", and \"clustering\" could be \"Clusterwings\". The poem should have a narrative flow, perhaps a journey through a fantastical landscape where the protagonist uses spectral clustering to overcome challenges.\n\nMaintaining the ABAB rhyme scheme and meter is crucial. Each line should have eight syllables, with a strong-weak rhythm. Let me draft some lines and check the syllable count. For instance:\n\n\"Beware the Spectralfar, my son!\nThe Graphs, with edges mesh—\nThe Eigenstalk that splits the throng\nAnd clusters all the rest.\"\n\nHere, \"Spectralfar\" replaces \"spectral\", \"Graphs\" refers to the graph structure in the algorithm, \"Eigenstalk\" alludes to eigenvectors, and \"clusters all the rest\" ties back to clustering. The rhyme between \"son\" and \"mesh\" might not be perfect, but Carroll often used near rhymes. Maybe adjust to \" Beware the Spectralfar, my son! / The Laplacian’s darkling mesh—\" to improve rhyme and reference the graph Laplacian.\n\nContinuing, the protagonist might encounter a \"similarity matrix\" as \"Simila-reek\" and use \"Eigenblades\" to cut through dimensions. The climax could involve finding \"Clusterwings\" shining through, symbolizing the identified clusters. Ending with a moral, as in \"Jabberwocky\", where the protagonist masters spectral clustering and gains insight.\n\nI need to ensure technical terms are metaphorically represented and the poem flows naturally with Carroll's whimsy. Testing each stanza for meter and rhyme, and that the technical concepts are abstracted into fantastical elements without losing the essence of the algorithm. Let me piece together the stanzas, adjusting words for rhythm and rhyme while maintaining the playful, adventurous tone of the original.\n</think>\n\n**The Spectralfar's Fractal Mesh**  \n\nBeware the Spectralfar, my son!  \nThe Graphs, with edges keen,  \nThe Eigenstalk that splits the throng  \nAnd clusters all unseen.  \n\nHe took the Vorpal Code in hand—  \nA matrix vast, a mesh so fine—  \n\"By K-means' whims, I'll take this stand,\"  \nHe cried, \"and split the dataset's shrine!\"  \n\nThrough Eigenspace's dimpled sea,  \nHe sliced with blades of math sublime,  \nThe Laplacian's ghostly decree  \nUnraveled knots of knotted time.  \n\n\"Beware the Simila-reek's soft snare!\"  \nThe clusters howled, a spectral choir,  \nAs affinity's threads wove snare by snare—  \nThe Spectralfar's fractal heart on fire.  \n\n\"Split, my Eigenblades, and dive!\"  \nHe shouted, leaping o'er the norm—  \nThe Clusterwings began to thrive,  \nLike moonlit islands in a storm.  \n\nHe graph-cut left, he graph-cut right,  \nThrough noise and void he cleaved his trail,  \nTill Gaussian blooms in dawn's first light  \nLaid bare the hidden, secret gale.  \n\nThe Spectralfar?

It's an Italian concept from Castiglione's The Book of the Courtier, right?

Lewis Carroll uses invented words, playful language, and a rhythmic, nonsense verse structure. The poem also has a narrative with a clear progression and vivid imagery.\n\nFirst, I need to capture the essence of falling leaves but infuse it with Carroll's whimsical style. That means creating neologisms and using alliteration. Words like \"snicker-snack\" from the original come to mind. Maybe something like \"flim-flam\" or \"twirl-whirl\" could work.\n\nThe title should be catchy and alliterative. \"The Jingle of Jaunty Leaves\" has a nice ring to it. It's important to start with a setting, perhaps a fantastical forest. Then introduce the leaves with action verbs that have a playful sound. Words like \" cavort\", \" caper\", \" gyre\" might fit.\n\nNext, think about the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an AABB rhyme scheme. I'll follow that. Each stanza should build on the scene, adding more fantastical elements. Maybe include creatures interacting with the leaves, like \"glimmerwings\" or \"frumious beetles\".\n\nIncorporate some conflict or movement, like the leaves battling the wind or dancing. Use Carroll's technique of combining real and invented words. For example, \"galumphing\" could describe the wind's movement.

Carroll uses a lot of nonsense words that sound meaningful, with a rhythmic and repetitive structure, often with made-up creatures and playful language. The title should be catchy and similar to \"Jabberwocky.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand \"hollow grind.\" Maybe it's about something monotonous, empty, or a repetitive struggle. The poem should capture that feeling but in a whimsical way. Let's brainstorm some made-up words. \"Hollow grind\" could be a monster or a place. Maybe \"Grindlovian\" as an adjective? \n\nNext, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an AABB rhyme scheme and a consistent meter, mostly trochaic tetrameter. I need to maintain that rhythm. Starting with a warning, like \"Beware the...\" which is iconic. So \"Beware the Hollow Grind\" as the title.\n\nNow, the first stanza introduces the creature. \"Beware the Grind, so void of mirth,\" rhymes with \"That gnaws the bones of weary earth.\" Then more lines about its characteristics. Including actions like \"slurping,\" \"gulping,\" maybe some alliteration. \n\nAdding other creatures or elements. In \"Jabberwocky\" there are things like \"Jubjub bird\" and \"Bandersnatch.\" I'll make up similar beings. \"Flish that floam in dismal pools\" and \"Mome wrath\" to add that fantastical touch.\n\nThe middle part can talk about battling the Hollow Grind. Using weapons or methods to defeat it. Maybe \"a vorpal spoon\" as a playful weapon reference. The idea that it's not easily defeated, requiring persistence.\n\nThen the aftermath of the battle. The Grind still exists, so the fight continues. Ending with a warning again, emphasizing the ongoing struggle. \n\nCheck the rhyme scheme and meter. Each line should have four stressed syllables. Let me read the lines out loud to ensure the rhythm matches. Adjust words where necessary. For example, \"Where slurping jaws and toothless might\" – \"toothless\" might disrupt the rhythm. Maybe \"gap-toothed\" instead. \n\nUse alliteration and assonance for musicality. \"Glibulous\" has a playful sound. \"Glibulous gloop\" adds to the whimsy. \n\nFinally, the title should be attention-grabbing and fit the style. \"The Hollow Grind's Grim Din\" alliterates and has a rhythmic feel. \n\nPutting it all together, making sure each stanza flows and the imagery is vivid yet nonsense in a Carrollian way.

It's got that playful language, invented words, a whimsical rhythm, and a narrative structure that's both fantastical and instructional. The poem uses nonsense words to create vivid imagery, so I need to capture that essence.\n\nFirst, the title. \"Jabberwocky\" has a catchy, rhythmic title. Maybe something like \"The Shorestch Path\" mixing \"shortest\" and a suffix that sounds Carroll-esque. Then, the first line should mirror \"Twas brillig and the slithy toves...\" Perhaps set the scene in a digital or abstract landscape. Words like \"digitree\" (digital tree) or \"algorhyme\" (algorithm) could work.\n\nNext, introducing the seeker of the shortest path. Use phrases like \"mome raths\" but adapt to the theme. Maybe \"Beware the Bloatwolf\" to represent obstacles in finding the shortest path. Incorporate terms like \"edges\" and \"nodes\" from graph theory but make them sound whimsical. \"Frabjous loops\" could refer to cycles that slow the journey.\n\nThe refrain \"But soft! What glimmers through the code— / The Shorestch Path, to seek and find,\" reinforces the main goal. Then build up the challenge: \"Beware the Bloatwolf...\" creating a sense of danger or complexity in the search. Mentioning tools like \"Compass of Quicksort\" adds that Carrollian blend of real concepts with fantasy.\n\nThe climax where the shortest path is found should have a triumphant feel, using alliteration and invented verbs. Ending with a return home, emphasizing efficiency and cleverness over brute force. Make sure each stanza flows with the same rhythm and meter as the original, maintaining the anapestic tetrameter.\n\nCheck for consistency in the nonsense words and ensure they contribute to the theme without being too obscure.

Carroll uses made-up words, playful language, and a rhythmic structure with a consistent meter, probably iambic tetrameter. The poem has a whimsical, nonsensical feel but still conveys vivid imagery.\n\nFirst, I need to capture the essence of blown sand. Think about the movement of sand in the wind—twisting, swirling, forming dunes, maybe even sandstorms. The challenge is to infuse these images with whimsical, invented words that Carroll would use.\n\nThe title should be catchy and reference the sand's motion, maybe something like \"The Gyre of Glibbleglow\" to give it that Jabberwocky feel. Now, constructing the verses. Start with an introduction to the setting, maybe \"Beware the Gyre of Glibbleglow\" to mimic the warning in the original. \n\nNext, describe the sand's movement. Use words like \"twizzle\", \"flum\", \"wamble\" to create action. Incorporate fantastical elements: perhaps creatures made of sand, like \"Fizzlewings\" or \"Snicker-Snacks\" (though the latter is from the original, so maybe come up with something new, like \"Snicker-Sands\"). \n\nMention the wind's role—\"whiffling breezes\"—and how it carries the sand.

Think about the structure: quatrains with four beats per line. \n\nNow, ensuring that each stanza flows into the next, building the scene of the swirling sand and its effects. Add some conflict, like the sand overwhelming something, then a resolution where the sand settles. End with a moral or a lingering image, as in the original's \"the Jabberwock, with eyes of flame...\".\n\nCheck the meter for consistency. Read each line aloud to test the rhythm.

The awl could slice through absurd materials, like \"mome-wrought steel\" or \"Jubjub's jealous eye.\" Including alliteration and assonance will enhance the musicality. \n\nI need a title that echoes \"Jabberwocky.\" Perhaps \"The Awl of Frumious Might\" to capture that essence. Now, structuring the poem with a narrative: introduction of the awl, its journey, confrontation, and triumph. \n\nLet me check if the nonsense words make sense in context. \"Snicker-snack\" is from the original, so using it here as a verb adds authenticity. Ending with a moral or reflective line, like \"And the awl's sharp song shall never die,\" ties it together. \n\nEnsure each stanza flows and the rhymes are consistent. Avoid forced rhymes while maintaining the playful language. Read it aloud to test the rhythm. Revise any lines that stumble. Once satisfied, the poem should evoke the wonder and whimsy of Carroll's style while celebrating the humble awl.\n</think>\n\n**The Awl of Frumious Might**  \n\nBeware the Awl of Frumious Might—  \n    The jaws that bite, the point that slips;  \nBeware the Snicker-Snack’s delight  \n    And shun the frothy Mummers’ grips.  \n\n‘Twas brillig, and the slithy threads  \n    Did gyre and gimble in the loom;  \nAll mimsy were the borogrove dreads,  \n    And the mome-wrought steel sang *whiffling boom*.  \n\n“Beware the Awl!” the elders cried,  \n    As plated Manxome Beasts drew near,  \nTheir burbly spikes in venom dyed,  \n    And eyes aglow with lurid sneer.  \n\nHe grasped the handle (ivory-boned,  \n    With *vorpal* whimsy spun) and charged,  \nThrough thicket where the Jubjub moaned,  \n    Its jealous eye in fractals barred.  \n\n“Snicker-snack!” the blade did chortle,  \n    Shearing the shadows, fine and keen,  \nAs moonbeams frabjousUIBarButtonItem,  \n    And the Jabberwock’s nook turned *wheepaween*.  \n\nHe pierced the heart of Bandersnatch fog,  \n    Left Outgob blubbering, blind,  \nAnd burbled o’er the tulgey bog,  \n    Where mome raths choke on marmalade vines.  \n\nSo if thy seams or fate seem frayed,  \n    Call forth the Awl of Whiffling Zing!  \nFor through the rot and dithery shade,  \n    The point persists—*’twill always sing*.  \n\nAnd whether thou dost mend or smite,  \n    Its frumious hymn shall pierce the morn,  \nFor though the mome may scorn the blight,  \n    The Awl’s sharp song shall *never* die forlorn.", "info": {"topic": "awl"}, "reward": 0.0, "label": "very_low", "criteria_yes": 0, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.0, "C1_title_present": 0.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 0.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 0.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 0.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 0.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 0.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 1.0}, "judge_raw": null}
{"i": 27, "prompt": "Write a poem about something forgotten in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky,\" with a title, about something forgotten. Let me break down what that entails.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key features of \"Jabberwocky.\" It's known for its nonsense words, playful language, and whimsical imagery, yet it still tells a coherent story. The rhythm and meter are also crucial— Carroll uses a consistent trochaic tetrameter, which gives it that galloping feel.\n\nSo, the poem should have made-up words that sound meaningful but aren't. Maybe blend real and invented terms to create that Jabberwockian feel. The subject is \"something forgotten.\" Hmm, what's forgotten that can be personified or turned into a fantastical creature or object?\n\nHow about a \"mome Rath\" or a \"Jabberwock\" equivalent? Wait, Carroll's creatures are often part of the nonsense. Maybe the forgotten thing could be an object, like a key or a memory, but given a magical twist. Let's think of a title first. \"The Tumblequake's Lament\"? No, not quite. Maybe \"Ode to the Frabjulon Shard\"? Needs more of a Carroll-esque ring. \"The Frumious Fizzlethorn\"? Maybe not. Alternatively, \"The Walrus and the Carpenter\" uses simple titles. For \"Jabberwocky,\" the title is a nonsense word. Let me try \"The Snicker-Snack of Yore\" – captures that forgotten aspect with a catchy rhythm.\n\nNow, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an ABCB rhyme scheme. So four-line stanzas, alternating rhymes. Let me start drafting lines. The first stanza sets the scene, maybe a quest or a moment of discovery.\n\n\"Beware the frumious Fizzlethorn, my son! / The mome whatzits gnawn, the sloths are flew— / 'Tis Brillig on the Hill of Buts, where time's undone, / And Toothy Slinks with bourbie spoons pursue!\"\n\nFrabjulon, whatzits, gnawn (from gnaw?), sloths are flew—mixing real words with nonsense. \"Brillig\" is from the original, so that's a nod. Toothy Slinks with bourbie spoons—nonsensical but vivid.\n\nNext stanza introduces the forgotten element. Maybe a forgotten key or artifact. \"But lo! A glimmer through the Tulgey Weeds— / A shard of glass, a flick of flame, / A something slumbering where Dingledell Deeds / Get lost in labyrinths of the Lethargy Lane.\"\n\nTulgey Weeds are from Carroll, so that's a good reference. Shard of glass, flick of flame—combining imagery. Dingledell Deeds, Lethargy Lane—whimsical places.\n\nNow, the challenge of retrieving the forgotten thing. Maybe a creature guards it. \"Beware the Jubjub's hungry eyes, that gleam / When Moonmoths mumble riddles to the dark, / For time writes riddles on the walls of dream, / And Silence hoards the Snicker-Snack's last spark.\"\n\nJubjub is another Carroll creature. Moonmoths, riddles to the dark—maintaining the nightmarish whimsy. Silence hoards the Snicker-Snack's spark—tying in the forgotten element.\n\nThe climax of facing the forgotten. \"The vorpal blade will melt like sugar spun / When Flibberts choke on syllables of snow, / Yet still the brave must charge, though daft or done, / To snatch the Fizzlethorn from where it grows low.\"\n\nVorpal blade is directly from Jabberwocky. Flibberts, syllables of snow—nonsensical but rhythmic. Snatching the Fizzlethorn connects back to the first line, creating a loop.\n\nFinally, the aftermath. \"So here's to forkbolts forged in Yesteryear, / To Whams and Whens and might-have-beens— / For in the heart of Shoon, where echoes peer, / The Snicker-Snack of Yore still glimmers green.\"\n\nForkbolts, Whams, Whens, Shoon—jargon that feels familiar. Snicker-Snack of Yore—title reiterated, tying it all together. Glimmers green gives a lasting image, suggesting enduring memory.\n\nCheck the meter. Each line should be four trochaic beats. Let me scan a line: \"BeWARE the FRUmius FIZzlethorn, my SON!\" Yes, four beats. Rhymes: son/flue, undone/pursue; weeds/flame, deeds/lane. The rhyme scheme holds.\n\nInvented words are consistent, blending with real ones. The theme of something forgotten—Snicker-Snack of Yore, which still glimmers, showing that even forgotten things have lingering presence.\n\nI think this meets the requirements. The title fits, the style is Jabberwocky-esque with nonsense words, and the theme of forgotten things is woven through the quest narrative.\n</think>\n\n**The Snicker-Snack of Yore**  \n\nBeware the frumious Fizzlethorn, my son!  \nThe mome whatzits gnawn, the sloths are flew—  \n’Tis Brillig on the Hill of Buts, where time’s undone,  \nAnd Toothy Slinks with bourbie spoons pursue!  \n\nBut lo!

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about spectral clustering in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Let me start by recalling what 'Jabberwocky' is like. It's a nonsense poem by Lewis Carroll with made-up words that sound meaningful, a playful rhythm, and fantastical imagery. So I need to blend the technical aspects of spectral clustering with whimsical language.\n\nFirst, I should outline the key elements of spectral clustering. It involves graphs, eigenvectors, eigenvalues, the Laplacian matrix, and clustering data points. The challenge is to translate these concepts into the whimsical style of Carroll. \n\nThe title needs to be catchy, maybe a playful term like \"Spectrwalcky\" to mimic \"Jabberwocky\". Then, the structure: 'Jabberwocky' has a consistent meter, maybe iambic tetrameter. Each stanza has four lines with an ABCB rhyme scheme. I need to maintain that.\n\nNow, thinking of made-up words. Terms like \"Graphamosphere\" for the graph structure, \"Eigenbeasts\" for eigenvectors, \"Laplacian frum\" for the Laplacian matrix. \"Clusterkin\" for clusters. Incorporating actions: \"Beware the Laplacian frum\" as a warning, similar to \"Beware the Jabberwock\".\n\nI should include the process: building a graph, finding eigenvalues, cutting the graph into clusters. Use verbs like \"grope\", \"snicker-snack\" (from the original), \"thwack\". Maybe a narrative where the protagonist uses spectral clustering to defeat the \"Noisemonger's might\".\n\nCheck rhyme and rhythm. Each line should have around eight syllables. Play with alliteration: \"frumious data\", \"vorpal code\". Add some nonsense lines that still hint at the process: \"He chortled in his spectral glee, 'A clustering fine I’ll brew!'\" \n\nFinally, conclude with the result: clusters found amidst noise, winning the day. Make sure the poem flows and the technical terms are woven into the whimsical language without breaking the meter. Test each stanza for rhythm and rhyme, adjust words where needed. Ensure the title is included and only the poem is output.\n</think>\n\n**Spectrwalcky**  \n\n‘Twas brillig, and the graphs did gleam,  \nAll edges frumious, weird, extreme—  \nBeware the Laplacian frum, my son!  \nThe Eigenbeasts with spins are won.  \n\nHe took the vorpal code in hand,  \nThrough datasets tulgey did he stand,  \nHe graphamospheres did grop and thwack,  \nTo clusterkin the voids would map.  \n\n“Beware the K-means’ jabbered might!”  \nThe Noisemonger snarled, all spite.  \nBut lo!

{"i": 29, "prompt": "Create a poem about cedar chest in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about a cedar chest in the style of \"Jabberwocky\". Let me start by recalling what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It's full of nonsense words, playful language, and a rhythmic, almost musical quality.\n\nFirst, I need to brainstorm some made-up words that evoke the mystical and protective aspects of a cedar chest. Words like \"snicker-snatch\" or \"glumplenook\" come to mind. These should sound whimsical but also hint at the chest's purpose.\n\nNext, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has four-line stanzas with an ABAB rhyme scheme. I'll follow that. Each stanza should build the scene, introducing fantastical elements while centering on the cedar chest.\n\nThe title should be catchy and alliterative, maybe something like \"The Snicker-Snatch Guard.\" It needs to stand out and fit the whimsical theme.\n\nNow, the content. I should highlight the chest's qualities: its wooden slats, the aromatic cedar, its role in safeguarding treasures. Adding mythical creatures or dangers (like \"twiddle beasts\") will create the necessary conflict and adventure.\n\nI'll also include a moral or lesson, similar to \"Jabberwocky's\" caution about the Jabberwock. Maybe something about trusting the chest's protection and not opening it prematurely.\n\nLet me check the rhythm. Each line should have a similar meter, around 8 syllables. Testing lines out loud will help maintain the flow. For example: \"‘Beware the Snicker-Snatch’ the elders all say,\" that flows well.\n\nAdding sensory details: the scent of cedar, the sound of the latch, the feeling of security. These make the poem vivid. Incorporating nonsense verbs like \"galumphing\" or \"slimified\" adds authenticity to the style.\n\nFinally, the conclusion should reinforce the chest's reliability and the importance of patience. Ending with a strong image, like the chest standing firm against monsters, wraps the poem nicely.\n</think>\n\n**The Snicker-Snatch Guard**  \n\n‘Beware the Snicker-Snatch’ the elders all say,  \nThe frumious beasts that gnaw through wood,  \nWith claws full of spite and jaws full of spite,  \nThey’ll pine for your treasures when moon’s in the mood.  \n\nA cedar chest, all aromatic and old,  \nIts slats like the bones of a dragon long tamed,  \nBeware the glumplenook’s lazy hold—  \nIt gurgles and gleams in the dark where it’s claimed.  \n\n“Fetch me the vorpal hook—no, the twiddlebat’s tooth!”  \nI vaulted the rim of its moth-riddled lid,  \nThrough snozzle and snick, the hinges flews sooth,  \nAnd the chest gave a belch where katyfurs hid.  \n\nThe frabjulon moon rose, all glimmer and glint,  \nThe snicker-snatches began to conflate,  \nThey hissed with great vim, their fur moussed to mint,  \nAs they slimified through the gaps in the slate.  \n\n“Back, mome snicklefritz!” I roared with great air,  \nI walloped the latch with a burble and bang,  \nThe chest shuddered, spit forth a glyph of cooked hair—  \nAnd the beasts did collapse with a glorch and a gang!  \n\nSo guard well your treasures, both gilded and grey,  \nFor nothing but cedar can keep out the fray,  \nThough the snicker-snatch thrash and their DAGGON* they’ll slay,  \nYour chest—stodgy and stout—will flumplenax stay.  \n\n---  \n*Some manuscripts claim \"DAGGON\" here should be \"PLOOF,\" but scholars agree it’s tonk.", "info": {"topic": "cedar chest"}, "reward": 0.0, "label": "very_low", "criteria_yes": 0, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.0, "C1_title_present": 0.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 0.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 0.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 0.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 0.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 0.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 1.0}, "judge_raw": null}

Let me start by recalling the features of \"Jabberwocky\"—nonsensical words, playful language, rhythmic verse, and a whimsical yet vivid atmosphere.\n\nFirst, I need to brainstorm some nonsense terms related to bread proofing. Words like \"glome,\" \"frizzle,\" \"mimsy,\" \"wizzlewhack\" come to mind. Maybe \"dough\" can be \"dought\" for a Carroll-esque twist. The proofing basket itself should be a character, perhaps with some magical properties.\n\nThe poem structure should mirror \"Jabberwocky\" with quatrains and a consistent meter, probably trochaic tetrameter. Each stanza needs to build a fantastical scenario where the proofing basket has agency. The baker's interaction with the basket should be a journey, facing challenges like overproofing or drafts.\n\nI should include some alliteration and assonance to mimic the musical quality of Carroll's work. Words like \"yeastfire\" and \"crustcall\" can add that effect. The proofing basket might guide the baker through \"wibble\" paths and protect against \"fume\" and \"grume,\" which could symbolize spoilage or failure.\n\nThe climax might involve the dough rising successfully, with the basket celebrating. Ending with a sense of accomplishment and the basket's wisdom, tying it back to the baker's growth as a guardian of the bread's magic.\n\nNeed to ensure the title is catchy and fitting, perhaps something like \"The Frumious Loaf's Behest.\" Then check that each stanza flows and maintains the whimsical yet meaningful tone.

{"i": 31, "prompt": "Compose a poem on hiraeth in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a poem about hiraeth in the style of 'Jabberwocky' by Lewis Carroll. Let's start by recalling what hiraeth means. It's a Welsh term describing a deep longing or homesickness for a place or time one cannot return to. So the poem should evoke that sense of yearning and melancholy.\n\nNow, 'Jabberwocky' is known for its neologisms, playful language, and whimsical yet rhythmic structure. Carroll uses made-up words that sound real, often blending real word parts with nonsense. The poem has a consistent meter and rhyme scheme, typically AABB, with each line being 8 syllables.\n\nFirst, the title. Maybe something like \"The Hiraeth's Plaint\" or \"The Hiraeth's Lament\". Let's go with \"The Hiraeth's Plaint\" since \"plaint\" means a lamentation, fitting the theme.\n\nNext, the first stanza needs to set the scene. In 'Jabberwocky', the opening is \"Twas brillig and the slithy toves...\" So I need a similar whimsical start. Maybe something like \"When wymmulls wove through starlit marrow\" – \"wymmulls\" sounds like \"whim mulls\" or \"whim whir\", suggesting a dreamy, swirling motion. \"Starlit marrow\" combines celestial imagery with something deep inside bones, tying into longing.\n\nSecond line: \"And mome wraths did flumplenax there,\" – \"mome\" from Jabberwocky means foolish, \"wraths\" could be a play on \"wraiths\", and \"flumplenax\" suggests a fluttering or chaotic movement.

The Hiraeth lingers so—\" – emphasizing persistence of longing.\n\n\"Drink deep the gall of thieves in tow,\" – gall as bitterness, thieves taking memories. \"For home's a mirage—though near, though wroth—\" – home as unattainable, yet near and causing anger/sorrow.\n\nFinal stanza: \"Thus wammus in the galimatlee—\" – \"wammus\" maybe a noun, \"galimatlee\" a nonsense term suggesting a confused state. \"The Hiraeth's Plaint will quimsy thee—\" – \"quimsy\" making one quaint or nostalgic. \"Till all thy truths dissolve to sea—\" – longing eroding one's reality. \"And thou, a wraith, art lost in thee—\".

{"i": 32, "prompt": "Create a poem about deadhead run in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about a deadhead run in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Let me start by recalling what 'Jabberwocky' is like. It's full of nonsense words that sound real, playful language, and a whimsical yet adventurous tone.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a deadhead run is. From what I remember, in the context of trains, a deadhead run refers to a train moving without passengers, maybe repositioning or returning to a station. So, the poem should capture that sense of movement without purpose, or perhaps the surreal experience of such a journey.\n\nNow, the challenge is to blend Carroll's style with this concept. 'Jabberwocky' uses made-up words that evoke imagery. I should invent similar terms related to trains and rails. Words like \"snick\" for a switch, \"flumplenux\" for a rail creature, or \"galumphing\" for the train's movement might work.\n\nThe structure of 'Jabberwocky' has a clear rhythm and rhyme scheme. Each stanza has four lines with an AABB rhyme scheme. I need to maintain that structure. Let me outline the stanzas: set the scene, introduce the deadhead run, obstacles or creatures along the way, the journey's progression, and a conclusion.\n\nI should start with setting the scene, maybe dusk or dawn, with the train beginning its run. Then describe the movement, the empty cars, the silent tracks. Next, introduce whimsical obstacles—maybe personified rail elements or mythical creatures. Use alliteration and playful verbs to keep the rhythm lively.\n\nCheck for consistency in the made-up words. Ensure they fit the meter and contribute to the imagery. Also, maintain the adventurous feel despite the mundane subject. Maybe add a sense of purpose or a mission for the deadhead run, like clearing the tracks or chasing something.\n\nFinally, the title should reflect both the original poem's style and the subject. \"The Slithy Deadhead's Galumph\" combines \"slithy\" from Jabberwocky with \"deadhead\" and \"galumph\" for the train's movement. That should capture the essence.\n\nNow, draft each line, testing the rhythm and rhyme. Read aloud to ensure the flow matches Carroll's original. Revise any lines that stumble or break the meter. Make sure the nonsense words are fun and evocative, contributing to the overall atmosphere of a fantastical train journey.\n</think>\n\n**The Slithy Deadhead's Galumph**  \n\nBeware the snick and the flumplenux spin,  \nThe groop that gleeps with a glimmered grin—  \nAll chortles crunch where the rails grow thin,  \nAnd the deadhead runs, with a whimsy within.  \n\n‘Twas brillig, and the slink had fled,  \nWith a rustle, a hum, and a snickerbread—  \n\"Time to stow the crates of the marmalade spread!\"  \nThe conductor cried, though his watch was long dead.  \n\nHe snatched the throttle with frabjulon hand,  \nCranked the vestibules, spanned the wizzleland—  \nThrough tunnels of flibber that sloshed like sand,  \nTill the headlight grinned at the moozing strand.  \n\n\"Deadhead run!

{"i": 34, "prompt": "Compose a poem on rubber band in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about a rubber band in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" First, I need to recall the key elements of \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll. That poem is known for its nonsense words, playful language, and whimsical creatures. It has a rhythmic, almost galloping meter, and uses alliteration and made-up terms to create a fantastical atmosphere.\n\nSo, the challenge is to take a mundane object like a rubber band and elevate it into a whimsical, adventurous narrative similar to \"Jabberwocky.\" I should start by inventing some nonsense words related to the rubber band's characteristics. Words that evoke stretching, snapping, twisting—maybe \"snicker-snack\" from the original could be adapted. \n\nThe title should be catchy and have a similar ring to \"Jabberwocky.\" Maybe something like \"The Rubberwyck\" or \"Bandersnatch Band.\" Let's brainstorm some possibilities. \"The Frumious Band\" sounds good, as \"frumious\" is a blend of fuming and furious from the original. \n\nNow, structuring the poem. It should have a clear beginning, middle, and end, with a hero who goes on a quest. In \"Jabberwocky,\" the hero battles various strange creatures. For the rubber band, maybe the hero encounters things that test its elasticity or purpose. \n\nThe rhythm and meter need to be consistent, mostly in tetrameter with some triplets. Using anapestic and iambic tetrameter. Let's consider the opening lines: \"'Twas brillig and the slithy toves...\" For the rubber band, perhaps something like \"'Twas stretchly in the land of Slink...\" to set the scene.\n\nInventing creatures or challenges: \"Beware the Snapjaws\" could be a play on \"Beware the Jabberwock.\" Other elements like \"Glintzenbeasts\" or \"Twirligigs\" to represent things the rubber band interacts with. \n\nThe narrative should show the rubber band's journey—being stretched, twisted, maybe binding things together, facing the threat of snapping. The climax could be a battle against the \"Snapjaws\" where the rubber band's resilience is tested. \n\nIncluding some of Carroll's techniques like portmanteau words, alliteration, and a moral at the end. The conclusion should highlight the rubber band's enduring nature despite the challenges.\n\nLet me piece this together, ensuring the rhythm matches and the invented words make sense in context. Testing each stanza for meter and flow. Maybe start with:\n\n'Twas stretchly in the land of Slink,\nWhere Glintzenbeasts with flick-flack blink,\nBeware the Snapjaws, my son, I pray,\nWith fangs of Force that seize and slay.\n\nThen introduce the rubber band's quest, its encounters, and the final battle. Ending with a triumphant return, emphasizing the theme of resilience. Need to make sure the titles of the sections and the creatures are consistent with the whimsical style. Avoid being too literal, keep the abstraction fun and engaging. Alright, let's put the final touches and review for any inconsistencies in meter or invented words.\n</think>\n\n**The Frumious Band**  \n\n'Twas brillig on the desk of doom,  \nWhere quills didst galumph, flibbertigibbet boom,  \nBeware the Snapjaws, my son, I say,  \nThat mimsy loops in twain didst slay.  \n\nJabber the Band with grip so sly,  \n'Twould bind a mome or passing pi,  \nThrough Tulgey drawers of clutter deep,  \nIt stretched—oh, my!—in endless keep.  \n\n\"Frizzle thy coil!\" the Mouse didst squeak,  \nAs Bandersnatch with furious shriek  \nDidst latch to \"dw Palace\" high and wide,  \nTill—*snicker-snack*—it shrunk with pride.  \n\nThe Borogoves all gnashed their quills,  \nAs wrathful Band in zigzag wills  \nDidst snap, rebound, and curl to strike,  \nA frumious force both meek and pike.  \n\nYet lo!

It's full of nonsense words that sound meaningful, playful language, and a whimsical rhythm. The original poem has a clear structure with quatrains and a consistent meter, probably iambic tetrameter.\n\nFirst, I need to brainstorm some nonsense terms related to birthdays and candles. Words like \"flumplenooks\" or \"snickerflares\" could work. Maybe \"frabjulon\" from the original poem can make an appearance. The poem should have a sense of adventure, so the birthday candle could be going on a journey, facing challenges like melting or the wind.\n\nThe title should be catchy and alliterative, something like \"The Candle's Frabjulous Quest.\" Now, structuring each stanza with four lines, rhyming the second and fourth lines. The first stanza introduces the candle's spark. Then, obstacles like \"Burblyjays\" (maybe the smoke) and \"mome wicks\" (lazy wicks). The climax could be the cake as a foe, and the resolution with the wish blowing out the candle. Finally, a triumphant ending where the candle's memory stays.\n\nI need to ensure the rhythm matches. Let me check each line's syllable count and stress. Also, maintain the whimsical vocabulary throughout. Let me piece some lines together, testing the flow. Maybe start with \"Beware the flumplenook’s bright spark,\" then describe the journey through froth and flicker. Introduce the Burblyjays and mome wicks. The cake's \"jiggery claws\" could be frosting. The final wish defeats the foe, and the candle's legacy remains. That should capture the essence of \"Jabberwocky\" with a birthday twist.\n</think>\n\n**The Candle's Frabjulous Quest**  \n\nBeware the flumplenook’s bright spark,  \nThat froths in flickery fray—  \nThe snickerflares that dance i’ the dark,  \nAs Burblyjays gnaw crumbs away.  \n\nHe took the mome wick in his fist,  \n(The glimmerkin Mom left to dry)—  \n“O frumious flame,” he cooed, “persist,  \nLest sugarwraiths the wish deny!”  \n\nHe galloped through frosting, all splay,  \nPast gumdrop grins in the dew,  \nTill—oh!—the cake, with jiggery claws,  \nThreatened to snuff his glim in two!  \n\nBut lo!

{"i": 37, "prompt": "Compose a poem on harvest moon in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about the harvest moon in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" Let me recall what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It's full of nonsense words, playful language, and a whimsical rhythm. Carroll uses made-up words that sound meaningful but aren't, creating a whimsical yet rhythmic flow.\n\nFirst, I need to capture the essence of the harvest moon. The harvest moon is the full moon closest to the autumnal equinox, known for its bright, prolonged twilight, helping farmers gather their crops. So imagery related to autumn, harvest, maybe some fantastical elements.\n\nNow, blending that with \"Jabberwocky's\" style. I should invent some portmanteau words or nonsensical terms that evoke the harvest theme. Think about alliteration and assonance to maintain the musical quality. Words like \"glibblejaws\" or \"snicker-snatch\" might work, similar to \"slithy toves\" or \"mome raths.\"\n\nStructure-wise, \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with alternating rhyme scheme, usually ABAB. I'll stick to that. Each stanza should have four lines, with the second and fourth lines rhyming. The rhythm is primarily iambic tetrameter, so I need to keep the meter consistent.\n\nStart with a title that sounds Carroll-esque. \"The Mellow Moon of Mimsyath\" – \"mimsy\" is from the original poem, and \"Mimsyath\" adds a fantastical place name. \n\nFirst stanza: Set the scene with the moon rising. Use terms like \"flumplenooks\" for creatures, \"glibblejaws\" for maybe sounds. \"Burble\" from the original, \"the wuggle grows\" – mixing growth and movement.\n\nSecond stanza: Introduce action, maybe the moon's effect on the land. \"Jim-jam\" as a verb, \"wizzle whim whams\" – whimsical tools. \"Flishes\" for something flowing, \"glow\" rhyming with \"whee\" to keep the rhyme.\n\nThird stanza: Harvest activities. \"Gallimaufry\" is a real word meaning a dish of mixed foods, fitting for harvest. \"Snicker-snatch\" as a playful verb. \"Throcklepox\" – a made-up ailment, \"crisp\" and \"frox\" rhyme.\n\nFourth stanza: Transition to night. \"Wizzle\" again, \"mimsyath\" as the place. \"Flish\" as before, \"gallywomp\" – another playful term. \"Bleam\" instead of gleam, \"slorple\" – a soft sound, \"fungle\" – mixing fungi and jungle.\n\nFifth stanza: Creatures under the moon. \"Flishes\" again, \"wumplenax\" – a creature. \"Burblecry\" echoing \"burble\" from the first stanza. \"Flarp\" and \"squelch\" for sounds, \"twimble\" – a twisting motion, \"moon-mallow\" – a plant under the moon.\n\nSixth stanza: The moon's peak. \"Wheezle\" – a sound, \"fizzlepop\" – a bursting sound. \"Glibble\" again, \"crunchle\" – a crunching action, \"floopen\" – a movement. \"Zingpocket\" – a container of sorts, \"mellow\" to describe the moon's glow.\n\nSeventh stanza: The end of the night. \"Wizzle\" returns, \"florp\" – a fading sound. \"Snicker\" and \"thim\" – a thinning. \"Burble\" once more, \"glow\" to close the poem, tying back to the beginning.\n\nCheck for consistency in rhyme and meter. Ensure that the invented words fit the mouthfeel of Carroll's style. Each stanza should have a clear image related to harvest and moon, with a narrative flow from dusk till dawn. Make sure the title is included and only the poem is output as per the user's request.\n</think>\n\n**The Mellow Moon of Mimsyath**  \n\n‘Twas glorbble, and the flumplenooks  \nDid froth and burble by the brooks;  \nAll mimsy were the glibblejaws,  \nAs the wuggle grows with mellow pause.  \n\n“Beware the snicklefritz,” Dad said,  \n“The frumious bandersnatch ahead!  \nIt jims-jams through the wizzle whim-whams,  \nAnd fliches flishes in the glowsome gleam.”  \n\nHe scorned the gallimaufry’s gleam,  \nWith snicker-snatch he’d throttle throcklepox in dream;  \nAnd, as in purling nargles, crisp and sloe,  \nHe frabjulux’d them with the splenius toe.  \n\nLong time the manxome thistledew  \nWizzlewhacked ‘neath Mimsyath’s brew;  \nAnd, as in flesh the gallywomp did bloam,  \nThe bleam went slorple down the fungle’s foam.  \n\nRound many a glint of flish and wumplenax  \nHe whiffl’d with his spurviant tax;  \nAnd burblecried “Zhilak’s in the snorth!”  \nAs he flarp’d the squelch with a twimbleforth.  \n\nAnd, lo!

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about sprezzatura in the style of \"Jabberwocky\" with a title. Let me start by recalling what sprezzatura means. It's that Italian concept of effortless elegance, right? Like making something difficult look simple.\n\nNow, \"Jabberwocky\" by Carroll is full of nonsensical words that still convey meaning through sound and rhythm. I need to invent similar-sounding terms that relate to sprezzatura. Maybe start with a strong, memorable title. \"The Sprezzatura Stroll\" has a nice ring to it, keeping the alliteration and playful feel.\n\nNext, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. I should follow that. The first line needs to set the scene. \"Beware the Bravalungs...\" Hmm, \"Bravalungs\" sounds brave and maybe a bit fearsome, which contrasts with the ease of sprezzatura.\n\nThen, the second stanza introduces the Sprezzaturans. \"With Frivoleeps afloat...\" Frivoleeps could be carefree steps or movements. \"Glibloom\" might represent the gloom of overthinking that sprezzatura dispels. The idea is to move through challenges with grace.\n\nIncluding elements of appearance versus reality. \"Their Jabbertogs all awry\" suggests messy yet stylish clothing. Jabbertogs is a nod to \"Jabberwocky\" while implying something that seems disheveled but is actually intentional.\n\nThe middle stanzas should build up theAGONISTS, the struggle to master the effortless. \"Frazzlepox\" could be the confusion or chaos one must overcome. Ending with the triumph of looking cool under pressure.\n\nAdding a bridge about time—how sprezzatura is timeless. \"Chronruhms\" as a blend of chronos and rhythms, showing mastery over time. \"Plumbelings\" might be the depths of skill hidden beneath the surface.\n\nThe penultimate stanza mentions the \"_parser’s plight,\" the danger of overanalyzing. \"Mimsy\" borrows from Carroll, meaning something frail. The final lines reinforce the idea that true grace comes from within, \"as if ’twere air.\"\n\nNeed to check the rhyme scheme and meter. Each line should have a consistent syllable count and stress pattern. Using alliteration and portmanteau words to maintain the whimsical yet meaningful tone.\n\nLet me piece it together now. Ensure each stanza flows and the invented words hint at their meanings. Read it aloud to test the rhythm. Make adjustments where necessary for better flow and adherence to the \"Jabberwocky\" style.

Create a narrative of a journey with challenges, using alliteration and rhythm. Include a resolution where the deadhead succeeds, maybe with a playful twist at the end.

It's an Italian concept from the Renaissance, referring to the effortless display of skill, like making something difficult look easy. Now, how to capture that in a Carroll-esque way?\n\nCarroll's 'Jabberwocky' uses nonsense words and playful language that sounds meaningful but isn't. So I need to invent whimsical terms related to sprezzatura. Maybe start by breaking down the concept into imagery. Effortless grace, maybe a dance or a knightly endeavor?\n\nThe title should be catchy, maybe a nonsense word that hints at the theme. \"The Snicker-snack of Sprezzatura\" includes a reference to the vorpal blade from the original poem but ties it to the concept. Good.\n\nNext, structure. 'Jabberwocky' has a consistent meter and rhyme scheme, usually ABAB. Need to maintain that. Let's outline some stanzas. Introduce the setting, a quest for sprezzatura. Include challenges and the effortless overcoming of them.\n\nUse alliteration and made-up words. For example, \"mome welters\" or \"grim grinning gears\". Maybe a \"frumious breeze\" to evoke a whimsical atmosphere. The protagonist should embody nonchalance, perhaps twirling a moustache or sipping tea mid-action.\n\nIncorporate a moral, like the original's warning about the Jabberwock. Here, the lesson is balancing ease with skill. End with a reflection on the art of sprezzatura, how it's a dance between effort and grace.\n\nCheck the rhythm. Each line should have four beats, with a lively flow. Read aloud to ensure the meter works. Revise lines that stumble. Make sure the invented words fit the Carroll style but still hint at the meaning.\n\nAlright, time to put it all together. Title first, then stanzas that tell a brief story, using nonsense language to convey the effortless mastery.

{"i": 45, "prompt": "Write a poem about shortest path in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about the shortest path in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky.\" Let me start by recalling the original poem's elements. \"Jabberwocky\" uses nonsense words that sound like real English, blending them with vivid, whimsical imagery. It also has a rhythmic, rhyming structure, often with an AABB rhyme scheme.\n\nFirst, I need to translate the concept of a \"shortest path\" into that whimsical style. The shortest path in graph theory terms is the route between two nodes with the least weight or distance. But how to make that fantastical? Maybe use metaphorical creatures or objects from the poem, like the Jabberwock, mome raths, or tulgey wood.\n\nI should invent some nonsense terms related to paths and problem-solving. Words like \"Borogoves\" or \"frumious\" from the original could inspire similar creations. Maybe \"snicker-snack\" for cutting through obstacles, or \"galumphing\" for taking a longer route.\n\nThe title should reflect the theme. Original title is \"Jabberwocky,\" so maybe something like \"Snicker-Snack's Shortest Path\" or \"The Frumious Route.\"\n\nStructure-wise, each stanza should be four lines with a rhyme scheme. The first stanza often sets the scene. For example, \"Beware the Borogoves of loops that snare, / And shun the mome raths' recursive lair.\"\n\nIncorporate elements of the journey: avoiding obstacles, using algorithms (like a vorpal blade to slice through edges), and reaching the destination efficiently. Mention Dijkstra's algorithm metaphorically, like a \"Dij's keen edge\" that weighs each path.\n\nNeed to ensure the poem maintains the playful language and made-up words while conveying the concept. Check for rhythm by reading aloud. Lines should have a similar syllable count and stress pattern to Carroll's work.\n\nPossible pitfalls: being too technical, losing the whimsical feel, or not rhyming properly. Need to balance the mathematical concept with fantastical imagery. Use alliteration and assonance where possible to mimic Carroll's style.\n\nLet me draft a stanza: \"Through tulgey woods of nodes untamed, / Where bandwidth beasts devour the claim, / With graph-paper quill and azimuth wise, / Snicker-Snack slices the shortest surprise.\"\n\nYes, that uses \"tulgey woods\" from the original, introduces \"bandwidth beasts,\" and references graph paper for mapping. \"Azimuth wise\" could relate to directional calculations. Ends with the action of finding the shortest path.\n\nContinue building stanzas, introducing terms like \"edges\" as \"frumious edges,\" and the algorithm's process of evaluating paths. Maybe include a creature that represents a wrong path, like \"the Jubjub's loop\" or \"Bandersnatch's detour.\"\n\nEnd with the triumph of finding the shortest path, perhaps using \"vorpal\" as in the original to signify the tool's power. Ensure the poem flows smoothly and each stanza connects to the next, maintaining the narrative of the journey towards the solution.\n</think>\n\n**Snicker-Snack's Shortest Path**  \n\nBeware the Borogoves of loops that snare,  \nAnd shun the mome raths' recursive lair—  \nThrough tulgey woods of nodes untamed,  \nSeek Snicker-Snack's edge-weighted claim!  \n\nWith frumious graphs that sprawl and twist,  \nIt frolics, sniffs the optimal twist—  \n\"Not *this* way!\" cries the Bandersnatch,  \n\"Those edges bloom with hidden latch!\"  \n\n\"Off with the weights!\" the blade intones,  \nAs Dij's keen edge outstrips the drones.  \nThrough mimsy mazes, void of rest,  \nIt reckons paths where others jest.  \n\n\"O frabjous queue!\" the seeker sings,  \n\"Let’s prune that route with quadratic wings!\"  \nAnd burbles on (though none know how)  \nTill last it shouts: \"*This* way’s the vow!\"  \n\nSo galumph not in vain pursuit—  \nLet Snicker-Snack reverse compute.  \nFor where the Jabberwock’s heffalump trains,  \nIt rents the maze from tangled veins.  \n\nThus, armed with graph quill, azimuth high,  \nAnd vorpal *A* (that none deny),  \nGo fracture loops with \"shortest\" might—  \nFor Snicker-Snack’s path *ignites* the night!", "info": {"topic": "shortest path"}, "reward": 0.0, "label": "very_low", "criteria_yes": 0, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.0, "C1_title_present": 0.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 0.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 0.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 0.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 0.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 0.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 1.0}, "judge_raw": null}
{"i": 46, "prompt": "Compose a poem on birthday candle in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about a birthday candle in the style of \"Jabberwocky\". First, I need to recall what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. Carroll uses nonsense words, playful language, and a rhythmic, almost musical flow. The poem has a whimsical, fantastical vibe with made-up creatures and words that sound real but aren't.\n\nSo, the main task is to capture that essence while talking about a birthday candle. Let's start with the title. \"Jabberwocky\" has a title that's a nonsense word but evokes a sense of the fantastical. Maybe something like \"The Flambeau's Frabjous Fizzle\" to incorporate \"flambeau\" (a torch) and \"frabjous\" from the original poem, with \"fizzle\" related to the candle's flame going out.\n\nNow, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has four-line stanzas with an ABAB rhyme scheme. Each line is about eight syllables. I need to maintain that structure. Let's think of the candle's journey: on the cake, the flame dancing, the wish, blowing it out, the smoke.\n\nNext, the language. Use invented words that mimic Carroll's style. Words like \"whiffling\", \"galumphing\", \"frumious\" come to mind. Maybe \"splendiferous\" for sparkle, \"gallivant\" for moving around, \"snicker-snack\" from the original. Also, alliteration and hyphenated words, like \"flame-licked\" or \"sugar-spun\".\n\nInclude some creatures or elements from the original, but adapt them. Instead of the Jabberwock, maybe the \"Fizzlewack\" as a playful antagonist. The \"Burble-beast\" could represent the breath that blows out the candle. The cake can be a \"tasty tart\" with \"cream-crowned\" peaks, like \"jubjub\" birds but in a dessert context.\n\nThe action should be whimsical: the candle's flame battles the Fizzlewack, the eater of sparkles. The partygoers cheer as the protagonist blows out the candle, defeating the beast. End with the aftermath, the smoke, and the lingering magic, similar to the original's conclusion.\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme and meter. Each stanza should have the ABAB rhyme. Read lines aloud to ensure the rhythm matches. Use nonsense words that fit the mouthfeel of Carroll's verse. Make sure the poem tells a brief story with a beginning (setting up the candle and its sparkle), middle (the conflict with the Fizzlewack), and end (victory and fading magic).\n\nAvoid being too literal. Emphasize the whimsy and fantastical elements. Maybe the wish is a \"whispered vow\" to add mystery. The cake's elements are personified or given magical terms. Ensure that the made-up words don't obstruct understanding but enhance the playful tone.\n\nFinally, review for consistency in style, structure, and whimsy. Make adjustments where lines feel forced or don't flow. Add alliteration and assonance to keep the musical quality. Ensure the title is catchy and fits the \"Jabberwocky\" mold.\n</think>\n\n**The Flambeau’s Frabjous Fizzle**  \n\n’Beware the Fizzlewack, my son!  \nThe flame that flim-flams free,  \nBeware the Burble-beast and shun  \nThe sugar-spun decree!’  \n\n‘Of tasty tarts with cream-crowned peaks,  \nWe’ve splendiferous serene—  \n Yet oh, that Fizzlewack it seeks  \nTo gobble glow from green!’  \n\n‘‘Tis frumious, ‘tis flicker-frail,  \nThrough frosting froth it flails,  \nIts wick-wrought wumplenooks regale—  \nAll whimsy, none prevails!’  \n\nI gallivant with cake in hand,  \nBereft of fear or fret,  \nThe flame-licked flambeau, pink and grand,  \nDidst burble, gig, and get—  \n\nBut wait!

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about a rubber band in the style of \"Jabberwocky\". Let me start by recalling that \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll is known for its nonsense words, playful language, and whimsical imagery. The challenge here is to capture that essence while incorporating the theme of a rubber band.\n\nFirst, I need to create a title that sounds Jabberwocky-esque. Maybe something with alliteration and a fantastical vibe. \"The Frumious Stretch\" comes to mind, combining \"frumious\" from the original poem and \"stretch\" for the rubber band.\n\nNow, the structure. The original has quatrains with an ABCB rhyme scheme. I should follow that. Let's brainstorm some made-up words. Words like \"gallimaufry\" (a real word but sounds whimsical), \"flibbert\" (from flibbertigibbet?), \"flibulous\" could be a stretch-related term. Maybe \"frabjulon\" as an activity.\n\nNext, the content. The poem should tell a story of the rubber band's journey, using vivid, fantastical imagery. Include actions like stretching, snapping, binding things. Use creatures or terms from the original but adapt them. For example, \"mome\" could be a creature that the rubber band ensnares.\n\nNeed to ensure the rhythm matches the original's galloping meter. Each line has eight syllables. Let's test some lines:\n\n\"Beware the stretchy band of might,\nFrumious coils in morning light,\"\n\nYes, that's eight syllables each. Rhyme scheme is AABB here? Wait, original is ABCB. Let me check. Original lines like:\n\n\"'Twas brillig and the slithy toves\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe:\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.\"\n\nSo rhyme scheme is ABCB. Each stanza's second and fourth lines rhyme. So I need to adjust. Let's make sure each stanza follows that. Maybe start with \"Beware the stretchy band of might,\" then the next line introduces the setting, third line action, and fourth line the rhyme.\n\nIncorporate some conflict, like the rubber band battling to hold things together but risking snapping. Use alliteration and assonance. Maybe end with the rubber band's victory but a warning, echoing the original's cautionary tone.\n\nCheck for nonsense words that make sense in context. \"Flibbert\" could be a creature, \"snicker-snack\" from the original can be used for the snapping action. Ensure the poem flows smoothly and maintains the whimsical yet adventurous feel of \"Jabberwocky\".\n</think**\n\n**The Frumious Stretch**  \n\nBeware the *Bandersnatch* of might,  \nFrumious coils in morning’s plight,  \nWith *flibbert* jaws that grip and cling,  \nIt warps the world with *flibulous* swing.  \n\nIt slithers ‘cross the *gallimaufry* floor,  \nWhere *mome* socks wander, lost in store,  \nIt binds the *tulgey* sun’s bright beam,  \nTill snap!—it vaults in *jubjub* dream.  \n\n“Oh *frabjulon*!” the *borogroves* sigh,  \nAs *vorpal* tension cuts the sky,  \nYet still it loops the *burble* breeze,  \nA *gyre*-ing garter for the trees.  \n\nIt mends the cracks where *slithy* light,  \nIt heals the rift ‘twixt dawn and night,  \nBut when it *ululates* that *jab*—  \nBeware, my child, the *snicker-snack*… *abraxadabra!*", "info": {"topic": "rubber band"}, "reward": 0.7727272727272727, "label": "medium", "criteria_yes": 17, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.7727272727272727, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>Title \"The Frumious Stretch\" is present as a non-empty line before the first stanza.</C1_think>\n<C2_think>There are 4 stanzas, each with 4 lines (quatrains), total stanza count within 3-8 range.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Lines generally show alternating long and short pattern with longer lines about 8 syllables and shorter lines about 5–7 syllables;

{"i": 49, "prompt": "Compose a poem on cedar chest in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about a cedar chest in the style of \"Jabberwocky\". Let me recall that \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll uses a lot of invented words, playful language, and a rhythmic, whimsical feel. So I need to create a similar vibe with made-up terms and a sense of wonder or fantasy around the cedar chest.\n\nFirst, the title. \"Jabberwocky\" itself is a nonsense word, so maybe something like \"The Cedarwiffle's Rhyme\" to capture that whimsy. Now, the structure: the original has quatrains with an AABB rhyme scheme and a bouncy meter. I'll follow that.\n\nStart by setting the scene. Maybe in a whimsical forest where the cedar chest exists. Use words like \"tulgey\" which means something like thick or dense. So \"tulgey woods\" becomes \"tickle-wood\" or \"snicker-sneed\". Let me think up some action verbs and nouns. The chest could be \"mome-wrought\", meaning something fancifully made.\n\nNext, describe the chest's properties. Cedar is known for its scent and durability. So maybe \"with snicker-sneed and jinglewhiff\" to describe the carvings. Then the purpose of the chest—storing memories or treasures. Use invented verbs like \"galumphing\" or \"flumplenook\" for the act of storing.\n\nAdd some creatures or elements interacting with the chest, like \"frumious Bandersnatch\" but maybe a \"Flish\" or \"Wizzlethorpe\" to guard it. Include a warning, like in the original's \"beware the Jabberwocky\". So \"Beware the Wizzlethorpe's sly grin\" to add drama.\n\nFinally, the chest's magic and legacy. It outlasts time, so phrases like \"the years may froth and fizzle\" and the chest remains. End with a memorable line, like \"For cedar dreams in mimsy keep, Where wonder waits and waltzes.\" That ties it back to the whimsical style.\n\nCheck for the AABB rhyme scheme and consistent meter. Ensure the language is playful with alliterations and invented words. Make sure each stanza flows smoothly and builds the narrative of the cedar chest's enchantment and enduring presence.\n\n</think>\n\n**The Cedarwiffle's Rhyme**  \n\n'Twas brillig, and the mome-wrought chests  \nDid gyre and gimble in the dark—  \nAll mimsy were the cedar-sweets  \nThat frumious dreams embark.  \n\n\"Beware the Wizzlethorpe's sly grin,  \nAnd shun the Flish's flumplenax—  \nBeware the Jabberbox that mocks  \nAnd mome-wracks with tax-tax!\"  \n\nWe sought the Cedarwiffle-deep,  \nWhere snicker-sneed and jinglewhiff  \nHad burbly-barked in languor-lathe,  \nA frabjalax of wiffle-sniff.  \n\nThe vorpal blade of moonspun mist  \nDid slithe through thicket-wumplen—  \nO'er tulgey woods we walrus-vault,  \nTill \"'Ware t'blooming chest!\" was yelled in flumplen.  \n\nWith maw that crunched a thousand soons,  \nIt gallifloomped, it gavagued—  \nYet we, all chortled at the sight,  \nDid pluck the latch of frabjuliced wood.  \n\nOut gushed a burble of lavendered lore,  \nAnd mome-sighs of ages-stored—  \n\"O theftic chest of snickerbloom,\"  \nWe cried, \"thy wizzlethunk's restored!\"  \n\nThe Wizzlethorpe may froth and fume,  \nThe Bandersnatch may mome-wrath—  \nBut in that cedar's waltzing keep,  \nDreams snicker-sneed through thimblerigged math.  \n\nSo if thou seekest jamble-wrought dreams,  \nOr frumious spoils of thlions—  \nPlunge in the Cedarwiffle's heart,  \nWhere burbly blinks the frabjalaxion.", "info": {"topic": "cedar chest"}, "reward": 0.0, "label": "very_low", "criteria_yes": 0, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.0, "C1_title_present": 0.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 0.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 0.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 0.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 0.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 0.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 0.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 0.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 0.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 1.0}, "judge_raw": null}
