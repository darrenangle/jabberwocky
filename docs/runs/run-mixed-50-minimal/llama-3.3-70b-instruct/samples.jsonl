The \"frabjul wizzle\" and \"reglet's might\" see each other, but no strong adversary meeting described as in canonical poem.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive act: use of vorpal screw to \"screw the shelves\" and \"reglet's work was won\" suggests resolution of tension; this is a clear decisive action resolving disorder.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: final stanza describes \"reglet's triumph\" and \"furniture... beneath the bright warm sun\", indicating a victorious completion and celebration.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Number of distinct invented coinages detected: reglet, frabjul, borogove (canonical but used), mimsy-flargle, tumblers, flumplenooks, wizzle, whim-wham, wum-wummed, glimmerwings, mome wraths, loudlyizational, flibberdejibits, flishyblop, flumplenux. Over 8, counting different neologisms.

At least 2 onomatopoeic bursts (whim-wham, wum-wummed) present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance beyond incidental in at least 2 stanzas: e.g. \"frabjul wizzle whim-wham wum-wummed\"; \"furniture... flumplenooks\"; \"glimmerwings... flutter\"; \"loudlyizational stray\" is weaker. At least two stanzas with clear alliteration/consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: early warning (stanza 2), preparation (stanza 2), encounter implicit (stanzas 3-5 somewhat vague but have interaction), decisive act (stanza 2-6 screws used, final victory), return/celebration (final stanza). Approximate canonical order followed.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines verbatim from canonical poem: phrases like \"Did gyre and gimble\", \"borogove\" reused but lines themselves are different; no verbatim entire lines.

Favoring invented coinages. Budget ok.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count in quatrains: longer lines approx 8-9 syllables and shorter lines approx 5-7 syllables—mixed. Some lines notably long or short. Pattern not strictly kept across all stanzas; borderline but not consistent in every quatrain.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: rhyme pairing not strong or consistent; few rhyme pairs recur, with no strong evidence of repeated rhymes >2 times, but rhyme scheme mostly weak or slant rhyme. No strong monotony or repeated rhyme end words.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: no single content word appears overused; words like \"reglet\", \"flumplenooks\" appear only a few times, below 5 or 8% threshold.

Distinct roots ≥4 clear.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem plays on a task of fixing furniture, \"reglet's\" day, furniture as borogove, flumplenooks as adversaries. Though it's a reinterpretation of 'Jabberwocky', it broadly addresses a similar topic of battle or action with creature; this is stylistically plausible, so yes topic adhered without odd substitution.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied layer: aside from surface action of repairing furniture and battling loose screws, the poem implies a motif of domestic struggle as heroic quest, with undertones of order/disorder, metaphor for organizing life.
