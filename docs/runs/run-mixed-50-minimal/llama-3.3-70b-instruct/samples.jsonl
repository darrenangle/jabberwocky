Some stanzas use only slightly coined or possibly standard words. Not every stanza has a clear invented coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: \"Murmurwort\" is a coined creature/entity named and central to action. Not canonical. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: No clear onomatopoeic bursts such as \"snicker-snack\", \"Pop!\", \"Hiss!\" present.

Not strongly varied.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is obviously overused. Lexical repetition seems moderate.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages present are limited in root variety; some suffixes or forms repeated. Probably fewer than 4 distinct roots for coined words. No.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem is about a named nonsensical creature (\"Murmurwort\") and its flight, evoking Jabberwocky style rather than substituting a different subject; topic broadly matches a Lewis Carroll style nonsense poem about a creature.

Within limit. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: long lines roughly 8–9 syllables, short lines about 5–7. Lines mostly uneven and variable length, many are longer but not tight meter. Probably fails tight syllabic pattern in ≥all stanzas.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: since rhyme (2,4) weak overall, rhyme variety is not meaningful; rhymes repeated rarely, no exact end word reused more than twice. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word overused; \"blued screw\" repeated but not over 8% content words. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages include blued screw, whirlygig, borbled, flumplen, wuggle, fractious (standard), plus canonical, so at least 4 distinct roots in coinages (whirlygig, borbled, flumplen, wuggle). Coined suffixes not monolithic. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem is about the \"blued screw\" and its mechanism, similar to the Jabberwocky narrative frame. As a retelling or style emulation with mechanical theme, topic clearly sustained.

E.g., first stanza lines 1 and 2 differ in length and content words by more than 2; but not consistently across 60%. Borderline, but on closer look, fewer than 60% show alternating longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content-word difference.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme scheme: In ≥60% of stanzas, lines 2 and 4 rhyme or slant rhyme without AABB dominance. Checking rhymes: \"gleam\"/\"keep\" no rhyme, \"agape\"/\"play\" rhyme imperfect; \"roar\"/\"fire\" no rhyme; \"thrum\"/\"sting\" no rhyme; \"appear\"/\"sway\" slant rhyme; last stanza \"hush\"/\"rush\"/\"way\"/\"sway\" partial rhyme. Only ~2 stanzas clearly have rhyme on lines 2 and 4. Below 60%. AABB not dominant either.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Final stanza does not echo opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words or clear refrain. Final stanza references some elements (\"Beware,\" \"thou,\" \"Voltigrab\") but no strong direct repeat of opening stanza key words or refrain.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition: Second stanza clearly contains \"Beware the Voltigrab...\" admonition to the protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: No stanza shows explicit preparation, taking up weapon/tool or planning; protagonist is a traveler but no tool or resolve preparation described.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: No stanza clearly shows an encounter/confrontation between protagonist and adversary; adversary described (\"Voltigrab\") but no meeting or battle scene.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: No clear decisive action or slaying; no resolution of central tension described definitively.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: No stanza describes return or celebration/jubilation after conflict.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Invented coinages include \"Voltigrab,\" \"Sparklewings,\" \"frumious\" (canonical), \"slithy\" (canonical), \"third-rail\" (not invented), \"dusk\" (normal); roughly 2-3 non-canonical coinages. Less than 8 distinct invented coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains ≥1 coinage? Coinages appear mostly in stanza 2 (Voltigrab, Sparklewings), stanza 3 (frumious), stanza 1 (slithy). Other stanzas less coinages, maybe none explicitly coined. Not all stanzas contain coinages.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature named and central: Voltigrab is named and described as an adversary; definitely non-canonical and central to poem’s theme.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia presence: No clear onomatopoeic bursts (\"snicker-snack,\" \"pop,\" \"hiss\"). None appear in text.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Some alliteration in stanzas, e.g., \"third-rail hum,\" \"murm'ring scream,\" \"sparklewings, that dance and play,\" but only 1–2 stanzas show clear alliteration beyond incidental. Need ≥2 stanzas with strong examples - borderline but likely no.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Warning present early; no explicit preparation; no clear encounter; no decisive action; no return/celebration. Arc order incomplete and some beats missing.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: No exact line repeats from canonical poem.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Canonical tokens present: \"slithy\" repeated, \"frumious\" once; total distinct canonical tokens less than or equal to 8; uses mostly new words.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Lines analyzed in first stanza e.g. \"'Twas Dusk (2 syll)/ and the Slithy Rails did Gleam (7)\"; lines vary, but most longer lines approx. 7-9 syllables, shorter lines somewhat shorter. Some variance but mostly inside target ranges.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Few clear rhymes of (2,4) lines as noted; very limited rhyme variety overall; repeated endings no more than twice, but rhymes rarely appear.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No overused single content word outside ring echo; no word exceeds 5 times or 8% content words.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages are \"Voltigrab,\" \"Sparklewings,\" \"frumious\" (canon), \"slithy\" (canon), \"rails,\" \"third-rail\" (not a coinage). Only 2-3 distinct roots; below 4 distinct roots in coinages.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem clearly addresses a \"Jabberwocky\" style involving electric train hazards (Voltigrab, Sparklewings, third rail). Topic is consistent with a Jabberwocky-style poem about a creature and environment.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: No strong or coherent implied layer beyond surface warning of deadly electric hazards, minor undertone of danger in technology but limited complexity or motif depth.</C24_think>\n</think>\n\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>"}

No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: found at least stanza 2’s “whirling dervish, mystic sleep” (w/d, s/s strong consonance), stanza 4 “whiffling wind” (alliteration), stanza 3 “frumious vole,” so ≥2 stanzas clearly show alliteration/consonance. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza 3) present early; no preparation; no clear encounter/confrontation; no decisive action; no return celebration. Arc beats incomplete and out of canonical order. No.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line matches canonical poem verbatim; the poem is original text. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget ≤8 distinct canonical tokens favored. Uses ‘brillig,’ ‘whiffling,’ ‘frumious’ (canonical), plus possibly ‘murmuration’ (not canonical), ‘vole’ (not canonical but English), so canonical tokens minimal and ≤8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Jabberwocky pattern longer lines ≈8–9 syllables, shorter lines ≈5–7 syllables alternating. Checking lines:\n\nE.g. stanza 1 line 1: ’Twas brillig and the stubble lay — 7 syllables approx.\nline 2: In frazzled rows, a golden grey — 7 syll.\nline 3: The sun did beat upon the ground — 7 syll.\nline 4: As murmuration’s whispers spun around — 9 syll.\n\nNo clear alternating longer/shorter pattern line by line. Mostly all around 7-9 with no alternating short lines. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: rhyme (2,4) pairs use ‘woe’, ‘low’, ‘flight’, ‘sight’, ‘bright’, ‘delight’, ‘coal’, ‘whole’: several repeats of ‘ight’ rhyme sound but no end-word used more than twice (coal and whole rhymed twice). Rhyme endings varied enough; no >2 exact word repeats except fitting rhyme pairs. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no single content word appears overused or dominant; poem is varied in word choice; no obvious overuse found. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: there are few coinages total, and not enough coinages to assess diversity of roots; likely no (as coinage count insufficient). No.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem addresses a similar theme of a whimsical, dangerous creature warned against, mimicking Jabberwocky style, but replaces Jabberwock with ‘frumious vole’ and murmuration imagery. Topic matches style/theme clearly. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Some implied motif of nature’s swirl, mystery of movement, danger lurking, possibly a meditation on fleetingness or nature's cycles; coherent implied layer is moderately present. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}
