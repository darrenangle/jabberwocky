The avoidance of AABB dominance is yes as only last stanza shows AABB, one stanza does not dominate. Pass.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza does not clearly repeat ≥2 content words/phrases from the opening stanza or form a refrain. The opening stanza has \"dusty twilight,\" \"sands,\" \"sandwriggle,\" \"gyring eddies\"; final stanza repeats \"frabjous sandwriggle,\" \"delight,\" \"desert,\" \"maddening,\" but no strong ring echo or explicit refrain. Does not meet clearly.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present in stanza 2: \"Beware the blowblast, my son, beware,\"—a clear warning to protagonist. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>No explicit preparation or arming before the encounter: no clear \"tool,\" \"resolve,\" \"wait,\" or \"plan\" described, just warning and descriptive verses. No preparation stanza visible.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter or confrontation is ambiguous; the sandwriggle is seen swirling in stanza 3, sandstorm as a \"fearsome beast\" in stanza 4. But no clear protagonist-enemy meeting is staged. The poem is more atmospheric than narrative. Slightly borderline but no clear direct encounter. No.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>No decisive act shown that resolves tension; no slaying or overcoming described. Only descriptive narrative of storm and sandwriggle. No resolution.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>No return/celebration or homecoming stanza; last stanza praises the sandwriggle but lacks celebratory or triumphant tone linked to protagonist. No hero return evident.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: \"Sandwriggle,\" \"blowblast,\" \"sandghosts,\" \"frabjous,\" \"gyring,\" \"whirly,\" \"maddening,\" and maybe \"whirly\" or \"woeful\" not coinages. At least 5-7 distinct new words are invented or rare. Not reaching 8 distinct invented coinages definitely (frabjous is canonical but not completely standard English). Possibly borderline but likely no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage: stanza 1 (sandwriggle, frabjous, gyring), stanza 2 (blowblast, sandghosts), stanza 3 (sandwriggle), stanza 4 (sandstorm, furious release), stanza 5 (frabjous, sandwriggle). So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature named and central: \"sandwriggle\" is named and repeated, central to action. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: only one possible onomatopoeic burst \"snickered\" but that's not onomatopoeia. No clear bursts such as \"snicker-snack!\" or \"Hiss!\" No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas: \"sands did play, frabjous whirlwinds,\" \"sandwriggle slithered, whirly and bright,\" \"sandghosts howl, whispers,\" \"sandstorm... rage and roar,\" some obvious multiple repeated initial consonants. At least 2 stanzas show clear alliteration/consonance. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning/admonition (stanza 2) → preparation (missing) → encounter/confrontation (unclear) → decisive act (missing) → return (missing). Arc is incomplete and out of canonical order, so no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No exact verbatim lines from canonical poem are present. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used: \"frabjous\" is canonical, no other clear canonical coinages from original poem detected in model poem text. Canonical tokens ≤8 probably yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines about 8-9 syllables, shorter lines about 5-7 syllables? Lines vary; e.g., stanza 1 line 2 \"Frabjous whirlwinds danced upon the day,\" = 8 syllables, stanza 1 line 1 \"'Twas dusty twilight, and the sands did play,\" is about 9-10 syllables. Shorter lines less clear in pattern; not tightly matching Jabberwocky meter consistently over all quatrains, so no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The pairs (play/day, beware/flare, sound/around, beast/release, sight/delight, reside/tide) are well varied; no reused rhymes beyond twice, good variety. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word overused excessively; \"sandwriggle\" used several times but appears less than 5 times or 8%; no overuse apparent. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages variety: coinages like sandwriggle, blowblast, sandghosts, gyring, whirly, maddening, blowblast, sandstorm are related to \"sand\" root frequently. Roots seem strongly sand- based, but there are also words like \"blowblast\" and \"whirly\" different roots. Possibly only 2-3 distinct roots dominate coinages, so no.</C22_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>no</C22>", "judge_error": "worker_error: process_row() takes from 7 to 8 positional arguments but 9 were given"}

First stanza discusses \"rubberly bright\" and \"flumplen band\" and \"waiting to snap,\" last stanza repeats \"flumplen band\" and \"beware its stretch,\" but the overall opening stanza phraseology is not echoed by final stanza. So no clear ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition/warning present? Yes, second stanza starts \"Beware the snap, my child, beware\" which is an explicit admonition.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation before encounter? The poem shows the band lying coiled and waiting to snap but no explicit protagonist preparing (tool/resolve/wait/plan). No clear protagonist prep line.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation? Third stanza describes \"The frumious fingers grasped it tight... And flung...\". This is the encounter with the band’s action triggered by fingers. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action resolving central tension? The band is flung with \"zing\" and paperclip is flung. No clear decisive slaying or destruction of band as in Jabberwocky; fourth stanza shows band comes to rest limp. Passive resolution but somewhat conclusive. This counts as decisive action enough.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration? No jubilant acknowledgement or clear return homecoming; the last stanza is a general warning, no celebration. No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count of distinct coinages invented: \"flumplen\", \"rubberly\", \"frumious\" (canonical), \"twang\", \"zing\" (common?), \"flumplen band\" coinage, \"wondrous sight\" is English.  \nChecking unique invented words: \"flumplen\" (coinage), \"rubberly\" (adjective coinage), \"frumious\" (canonical token, so not new), \"twang\" and \"zing\" are existing English words, \"snap\" etc. all English. Likely <8 distinct coinages; \"flumplen\" and \"rubberly\" only two coinages. Therefore no.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza with ≥1 coinage? Only \"flumplen\" and \"rubberly\" in first, \"flumplen\" and \"frumious\" canonical coinages appear but most stanzas do not contain a coinage, so no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central? \"flumplen band\" is named entity, but it is a thing, not a creature. Being central to action counts. So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"twang\", \"zing\", and \"ring\" (sound-related). \"twang\" and \"zing\" qualify as onomatopoeic bursts, so yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas? First stanza: \"flumplen band\", \"coiled with care\" alliteration; second stanza \"Beware the snap, my child, beware\"; \"frumious fingers\" alliteration in stanza 3; third stanza \"flung... joyful ring\" less alliteration; enough for ≥2 stanzas yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Canonical arc order: warning (stanza 2), then encounter (stanza 3), then decisive action (stanza 4), no explicit preparation between admonition and encounter, and no return/celebration. Arc order partially followed but no preparation, no celebration so no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: no lines match exact canonical Jabberwocky lines, all new wording. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used are: \"frumious\", \"mome\" (once), \"wraths\" (variant of \"raths\"?) \"bandersnatch\" not used; \"mome wraths\" phrase present but not exact canonical phrase; canonical tokens ≤8? Only \"frumious\" and \"mome\"? Within limit, yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines ≈8–9 syllables, shorter lines ≈5–7?  \nExamples: line 1 stanza 1: 8 syllables; line 2=7; overall pattern not strictly alternating in the poem; some lines too short or long, uncertainty. Overall not consistent enough for yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety across (2,4) lines: rhymes poor; lines 2 and 4 mostly do not rhyme; no rhymes repeated >2 times, but rhyme variety not applicable because rhyme not established.

Less than 60% of stanzas clearly alternate longer/shorter lines by ≥2 content words. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme (rhyme lines 2 and 4 in ≥60% stanzas and avoid AABB dominance): Rhyme pairs (2,4) are: creep/sake (no rhyme), beware/fair (rhyme), might/bright (rhyme), old/bright (rhyme). So 3 of 4 stanzas rhyme in lines 2 and 4 (75%). However rhyme scheme is mostly AABB or close, with first stanza not rhyming (creep/sake), second is aabb but okay, third and fourth stanzas rhyme in 2 and 4 lines consistently. No strict avoidance of AABB but the main requirement met with ≥60%. So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: The final stanza repeats the word \"awlvorath\" (as does first stanza), but no ≥2 repeated content words/phrases or a clear refrain exactly replicating opening lines.

Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: A figure \"the frumious cobbler\" grasped the \"awlvorath\" and stitched with it (stanza 3). This implies preparation or armament before the task. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: The poem does not show a clear opponent or confrontation. The \"snarlvor\" is warned against but never directly encountered or described in action. The protagonist (cobbler) uses the awlvorath, but no foe or obstacle interaction is clear. No.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: No explicit decisive action that resolves central tension like slaying or defeating an entity. The cobbler stitches with the tool but no battle or climax.

No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Only first, second, and third stanzas have coinages (\"awlvorath\" repeated), so only 3/4 stanzas have at least one coinage. Less than full coverage. No (require every stanza).</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: \"Awlvorath\" is named and central (a tool with a tip), but it is more a tool than a creature or entity; \"snarlvor\" mentioned as foe but unclear if it's a named creature or an adversary. \"Snarlvor\" is a possible creature name, but it's the adversary, not \"awlvorath.\" Since the criterion requires a non-canonical named creature/entity central to action and not \"Jabberwock,\" \"snarlvor\" is a named adversary and seems to qualify. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Only one sound described is \"whizzing sound,\" which is onomatopoeic but slight. No second example of onomatopoeia bursts like \"snicker-snack\" or \"Pop!

No.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: The arc involves warning (stanza 2), preparation (stanza 3 with cobbler grasping awlvorath), encounter is missing or unclear, slaying decisive action missing, return/celebration missing.

The \"Bittersweet\" is named but no encounter described. Mostly atmospheric rather than actual confrontation.

No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Some mild alliteration e.g. \"wistful wind\", \"whiffling winds,\" but fewer than 2 distinct stanzas with strong, non-incidental alliteration.

Seems borderline or no strong regular pattern - no.  \n<C4_think>Rhyme (lines 2 and 4) rhymes or slant rhymes in ≥60% stanzas? Stanzas 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 rhyme 2nd and 4th lines fairly well (e.g., galore/sigh’d—not rhyme; bold/light—near rhyme; sly/air—not rhyme; delight/cheer—not rhyme; friend/end—rhyme; zeal/remains—not rhyme).

First stanza: \"brillig\", \"birthday\", \"flumplen candle\", \"waxen\", \"flame.\" Last stanza: \"flumplen candle's birthday refrains,\" \"flame,\" \"embers,\" \"glow.\" \"flumplen candle\" and \"birthday\" repeated from title and first stanza, so at least two content words echoed - yes.  \n<C6_think>Is there an early admonition?

No clear sign of protagonist preparing weapon, resolve, or waiting. The candle \"quivered with delight,\" but no planning or armament before. No - no.  \n<C8_think>Clear encounter/confrontation? Snuffers are introduced as antagonists; \"until the snuffers came to an end\" in stanza 5 indicates confrontation implied but no direct clearly described meeting or battle scene - borderline, but no explicit clear meeting - no.  \n<C9_think>Decisive action? The snuffers come to an end (stanza 5), and final stanza \"So blow out the flame\" is the action climax. The wish and blowing are decisive acts resolving the tension.

Coinages include: flumplen, galumphing (canonical), fleemish, banders (from Bandersnatch, canonical root), meringued (standard English), jumble (English), wick (English), uffish not present; so coined words uniquely non-canonical clearly are flumplen, fleemish, possibly fiery friend metaphor (no coinage), others standard or canonical. Clearly less than 8 distinct invented coinages (flumplen, fleemish?), so no - no.  \n<C12_think>Does each stanza contain ≥1 coinage? Some stanzas have no invented words (\"birthday,\" \"snuffers,\" \"cake,\" \"wale,\" etc.), so no - no.  \n<C13_think>Named non-canonical creature/entity central to action? The \"flumplen candle\" is named entity. Snuffers are antagonists but generic object. So yes, candle is non-canonical named entity, central to action - yes.  \n<C14_think>At least 2 onomatopoeic bursts? No words like \"snicker-snack,\" \"burbled,\" or similar sound words.

Warning (stanza 3), no clear preparation (no), encounter unclear (no), decisive act (stanza 5), return celebration (stanza 6). Preparation missing, encounter unclear; so arc order is broken - no.  \n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines? All lines are original or altered; only \"’Twas brillig\" phrase is canonical but acceptable (canonical tokens allowed up to 8) - yes.  \n<C18_think>Canonical tokens count ≤8? Uses \"’Twas brillig\" and \"banders\" (probably related to Bandersnatch). Overall canonical words are minimal, well under 8 distinct tokens - yes.  \n<C19_think>Syllable meter per stanza, longer lines ~8-9 syllables, shorter ~5-7 syllables? Sample line syllables: stanza 1 lines: \"’Twas brillig on the birthday floor,\" (7 syll.) \"A flumplen candle stood galore,\" (8 syll.) \"With waxen wobbles, twisted high,\" (7 syll.) \"A fleemish flame that danced and sigh’d.\" (8 syll.) No clear alternate pattern of longer/shorter lines with the required ~8/6 syllable schema; mostly similar length lines.
