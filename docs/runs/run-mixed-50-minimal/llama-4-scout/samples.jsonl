No exact line match overall, so yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Use of canonical tokens minimal; only \"brillig\" directly canonical here. Canonical tokens ≤8; yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines generally around 8-9 syllables; shorter lines slightly shorter but mostly uniform line length with no clear alternating pattern matching Jabberwocky’s ~8/6 pattern. Some stanzas show similar line length for all verses; no clear longer/shorter tight syllable split. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhyme (2,4) not strongly consistent; some repetition of rhyme sounds but no overuse of exact rhyme endings more than twice ignoring ring echo; variety is mediocre but no obvious violation. So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word overused above 5 times or 8%. \"Hollow,\" \"grind,\" \"steel\" repeated a few times but not excessively over 5 times or 8% of content words.

Yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Check meter alternation in lines within stanzas: for ballad meter, lines alternate between longer (~8-9 syllables) and shorter (~5-7 syllables) with ≥2 content-word difference. Quickly scan first stanza:  \nLine 1: ’Twas brillig and the slats did gleam (8 syllables)  \nLine 2: In my attic, a chest of cedar beam (9 syllables)  \nAlready lines 1-2 both long. This does not alternate. Other stanzas also do not clearly alternate strong/weak line lengths or content word counts.

No.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Does the final stanza echo the opening stanza with ≥2 repeated content words or a refrain?  \nOpening stanza uses \"brillig,\" \"borogoves,\" \"mome,\" \"slithy\" is missing here. Final stanza mentions \"frumious cedar box\" - no clear echo with same content words as first stanza. No strong ring echo.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition early present?  \nSecond stanza includes \"Beware the hinges, my son, beware the lock,\" which is explicitly a warning. Yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: Before encounter, does protagonist prepare?  \nNo clear preparation or taking tool or resolve. The poem is more descriptive and advisory but no preparation described. No.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation?  \nThere is mention in stanza 4 of \"The Jabberwock of memories, long past and gone, Did stalk... beneath the cedar throne.\" This implies an encounter or presence of adversary. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action?  \nNo mention of decisive action or slaying or resolution. No.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return or celebration?  \nNo stanza narrates a return or jubilant celebration after conflict. No.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Are there >=8 distinct invented coinages (not canonical or English)?  \nCoinages: \"frumious,\" \"flumplenooks,\" \"whiffling\" (canonical), \"mimsy\" (canonical), \"galumphing\" (canonical), \"frizzle\" (borderline English; generally means crackle - may count as English), \"mome-like\" (derivative canonical)  \n\"frumious,\" \"flumplenooks,\" \"frizzle\" questionable, \"cedar beam\" not coinage, \"cedar throne\" no, \"frumious cedar box\" - frumious is canonical. Only new coinage clearly is \"flumplenooks\" (1), \"frizzle\" questionable, \"cedar\" not coinage, \"frumious\" canonical. Only 1-2 new coinages total. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Is there coinage in every stanza?  \nStanza 1: \"mome-like\" (derivative canonical)  \nStanza 2: \"flumplenooks\" (new) and \"whiffling\" (canonical)  \nStanza 3: \"mimsy\" (canonical)  \nStanza 4: \"galumphing\" (canonical), \"Jabberwock\" (canonical)  \nStanza 5: \"frumious\" (canonical)  \nAt least some coinage in every stanza but mostly canonical or minor variants. Might cautiously say yes, but overall coinage mostly canonical or derivatives. This criterion asks for coinage each stanza, so yes, even if mostly canonical.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Is a non-canonical creature named and central (not \"Jabberwock\")?  \nNo distinct named creature other than Jabberwock (mentioned once). \"Flumplenooks\" might be an entity but not clearly named as creature central to action. No.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Are there ≥2 onomatopoeic bursts?  \nNo bursts like ‘snicker-snack!’, ‘Pop!’, ‘Hiss!’ present. \"Frizzle\" describes an effect but is not a burst or typical onomatopoeia. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas beyond incidental?  \nExamples:  \n- \"slats did gleam\" (soft alliteration - possibly weak)  \n- \"frumious cedar box\" (alliteration not strong)  \n- \"flumplenooks that creak\" (fl and cr consonance)  \n- \"frizzle and fluttered\" (alliteration f)  \n- \"stalk, with stealthy steps\" (alliteration s)  \nAt least two stanzas have clear alliteration/consonance. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration  \nThe poem has warning (yes), lacks preparation (no), has encounter (yes), no decisive act (no), no return/celebration (no). So arc is incomplete and arc beats out of canonical order. No.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines?  \nAll lines are original except using canonical coinages and style. No verbatim lines from original poem. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens ≤8 and favor new coinages?  \nTokens used from canonical lexicon: brillig, borogoves, mome (mome-like), mimsy, whiffling, galumphing, Jabberwock, frumious, and possibly others?  \nCount canonical tokens used: brillig (1), borogoves (1), mome-like (1, derivative), mimsy (1), whiffling (1), galumphing (1), Jabberwock (1), frumious (1) — exactly 8 canonical tokens maximum. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Are syllable counts roughly correct for ballad meter: longer lines ~8-9 syllables; shorter lines ~5-7 syllables?  \nLines mostly have 8-9 syllables but lines 1 and 2 in stanzas often both long. The poem does not have strong alternating syllable count pattern per stanza. So no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety in (2,4) line end rhymes avoids repetition >2 times?  \nHard to evaluate since (2,4) generally do not rhyme. So no evidence of rhyme variety or repetition. No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Outside ring echo, no single content word is overused >5 times or >8% content words?  \nWords like \"cedar\" appear multiple times, but likely under 5 times and less than 8%. No content word overused. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: ≥4 distinct roots without one suffix dominating >50% of coinages?  \nOnly ~2-3 coinages total, with many canonical; insufficient coinage variety.

No celebration.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>The poem includes several coined words: \"Twangling\", \"Rubberine\" (title), \"Snap\" (ambiguous, but likely standard English), \"frumious\" (canonical), \"Slorg\" (non-canonical creature), \"mome-like\" (canonical prefix), \"twang-ed\" (coined inflection), \"wistful\" (standard English), \"twangling\". Counting only distinct non-canonical coinages excluding canonical ones (“frumious” and “mome”), we have \"twangling\", \"rubberine\", \"Snap\" (no, standard), \"Slorg\", \"twang-ed\" (same root as twangling), so maybe 3-4 distinct coinages but less than 8. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Is there at least one coinage in each stanza?  \nStanza 1: \"Twangling\", \"Rubberine\" (title), \"bands\" (standard), borderline coinage—\"twangling\" is coinage  \nStanza 2: \"Snap\" (standard), \"vorpal\" (canonical)  \nStanza 3: \"frumious\" (canonical), \"Slorg\" (coinage)  \nStanza 4: \"mome-like\" (canonical-related coinage), \"twisted fate\" (standard)  \nStanza 5: \"twangling\" again, rubbery (standard)  \nSo every stanza except possibly stanza 2 contains at least one coinage. Stanza 2 only has \"Snap\" (standard) and \"vorpal\" (canonical). So not all stanzas contain at least one coinage. So no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Is a non-canonical creature/entity named and central, distinct from 'Jabberwock'?  \nThe 'Slorg' is named and presented as an adversarial creature.

No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration or consonance in ≥2 stanzas clearly beyond incidental repeats?  \nSome limited alliteration e.g., \"bands did play\", \"twangling band\", \"wily stand\", but generally weak.

No.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration  \nWarning in stanza 2, preparation in stanza 2, encounter stanza 3, decisive act implied stanza 5, but no return/celebration.

Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens ≤8, favoring new coinages:  \nCanonical words present include: brillig, slithy, mome, frumious, vorpal, (twice), plus \"twisted\" (not canonical), \"snap\" (not canonical). At least 5-6 known canonical tokens used. Below or equal 8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Check syllable tightness: longer lines ≈8–9 syllables, shorter lines ≈5–7.\n\nFor stanza 1:  \nLine 1 '’Twas brillig and the slithy bands did play' ≈9 syllables (Twas(1), brillig(2), and(1), the(1), slithy(2), bands(1), did(1), play(1)) = 9 (approx)  \nLine 2 'Amidst the desk, in a wondrous way.' ≈7  \nLine 3 'The quills and papers, all astray,' ≈7 (counting syllables), slightly short.  \nLine 4 'As I chanced upon a rubber band's day.' ~8?   \nSyllable count roughly fits pattern but some inconsistency. Overall, mostly close to required meter.  \nSimilarly for other stanzas, approximations suggest lines near Jabberwocky meter. Probably yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: the (2,4) rhyme words are \"play/way\", \"Snap/stand\" (slant rhyme weak), \"wide/pride\", \"might/delight\", \"grin/spin\" - all distinct and no word repeats more than twice except 'Snap' in stanza 2 repeated for warning, so end rhyme varies well. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no single content word seems used more than 5 times or 8% given poem length (around 20-25 lines). No obvious overuse. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages like \"twangling\", \"rubberine\", \"Slorg\", \"twang-ed\" (same root), \"mome-like\" (canonical derived) – about 3-4 roots distinct.

Overall fewer than 8 distinct invented coinages.
