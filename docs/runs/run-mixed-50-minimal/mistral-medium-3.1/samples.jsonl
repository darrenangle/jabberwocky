No clear return journey or celebration after the action.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented coinages (non-canonical words uncommon in standard English, excluding canonical list and normal English):  \n- brink  \n- Wispwillow  \n- mimsy (canonical)  \n- Glint  \n- sprit  \n- Shimmer  \n- frumious (from canonical ‘frumious’)  \n- Dreamer’s Place  \n- uffish (canonical)  \n- whiffling (canonical)  \n- twine (common English)  \n- flick’ring (common English, contraction)  \n- starburst not used.\n\nAt least the following coinages: Wispwillow, Glint, sprit, Shimmer, Dreamer’s Place.  \n\"Frumious\" is canonical. \"Brink\" is English. \"Mimsy\", \"uffish\", \"whiffling\" canonical.

So no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named and central to action other than 'Jabberwock': \"Wispwillow\" (title and named in poem) is the main adversary/wisp caught. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: Whiffling (canonical), but no clear explicit onomatopoeic bursts like ‘snicker-snack’, ‘Pop!’, ‘Hiss!’. \"Lit his wondering face\" – no onomatopoeia.

But order of existing arc beats is canonical. So yes for order, no for completeness. Criterion specified arc beats appear in canonical order, not necessarily all beats present. Therefore yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line exactly matches canonical poem text; all lines are original or modified. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens ≤8: The poem uses some canonical words such as: mimsy, frumious, uffish, whiffling; others replaced (Jabberwock replaced by Wispwillow). Canonical token usage appears under threshold (around 4–5 canonical tokens distinct), so yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Long lines ≈8–9 syllables, short lines ≈5–7?  \nSample:  \n- stanza 1 line 1: \"’Twas brink of night, when silver bright\" ~8 syllables  \n- stanza 1 line 2: \"Did gleam the Wispwillow’s thread,\" ~6 syllables  \n- stanza 1 line 3: \"All mimsy glowed the skies bestowed,\" ~8 syllables  \n- stanza 1 line 4: \"And phantoms overhead.\" ~6 syllables  \nPattern roughly matches Jabberwocky meter. Similar pattern consistent in other stanzas. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhymes in lines 2 and 4 show variety across stanzas, no end-word reused more than twice. “Thread/overhead”, “snares/stares”, “grace/face”, “tight/light” show variety and no overused rhyme words beyond limits. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: no single content word clearly overused (like >5 times or >8%). The poem repeats “Wispwillow” 3 times but not excessively; no overuse. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: at least 4 distinct roots among coinages exist (\"Wispwillow\", \"Glint\", \"Sprit\", \"Shimmer\", \"Dreamer’s Place\" counted as compound coinage). No single suffix dominates >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem addresses a fantastical creature hunt in the spirit of Jabberwocky, focused on \"Wispwillow\" as adversary, analogous to Jabberwock, following the same theme and style. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied layer: some ethereal/ghostly motif (light, wisp, phantoms, elusive foe) with theme of pursuit and elusiveness.

Rhyme (2,4) holds clearly in stanzas 2,5,7 (7 repeats 1). Only 3 stanzas faithful. Below 60% threshold. So no.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Final stanza (stanza 7) repeats opening stanza almost verbatim with ≥2 identical content words (\"’Twas strumming\", \"wild mandoline\", \"silver beam\", \"trembled through the pine\"). Ring echo clearly present.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition: Present in stanza 2 (\"Beware the Tinebar\", \"Beware the fret, and shun the slide\") a clear caution/admonition to protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: Protagonist takes up a pick in stanza 3 (\"He took his pick in hand so tight\"), indicating preparation before encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter: Clear meeting with the adversary/object in stanza 4 (\"The Tinebar twanged with dreadful sound\", plus multiple onomatopoeic bursts), explicitly an encounter/confrontation.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: Missing a clear decisive act of 'slaying' or ending the conflict. Instead the protagonist responds happily (\"O frabjous day! ... He chirruped in his glee / And plucked again the merry way\"). No resolution by defeating the foe or ending the tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Present in stanza 5 (\"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! He chirruped in his glee\"), jubilation is explicit, but no clear return/homecoming narrative, just continuing joyful playing.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages: Distinct invented coinages (not canonical or standard English): \"Tinebar\", \"mandoline\" (misspelling of mandolin?), \"plinked\", \"plonked\", \"blooped\", \"sproing\", \"twanged\" (is twanged standard English verb?), \"whizzled\". Counting: Tinebar (unique), plonked (arguably sounds onomatopoeic but used in English?), blooped (not standard?), sproing (onomatopoeic but also English?). Total coinages bordering on borderline, but at least 7 distinct new coined or playful words not canonical or standard. Possibly below 8 distinct new coined words definitively distinct from English? \"Mandoline\" is misspelling, not coinage; \"plinked\"/\"plonked\"/\"blooped\"/\"sproing\" are playful but could be considered nonce onomatopoeic words. Tentatively say no for ≥8 distinct coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza should have ≥1 coinage. Stanza 1 has \"mandoline\", \"tinebar\" (only in 2nd), stanza 2 has \"tinebar\", stanza 3 has \"pick\" (standard), \"gleamed\" (standard), \"plinked\", \"plonked\" (both coinage-like), stanza 4 multiple onomatopoeia - \"twanged\", \"blooped\", \"sproing\", \"whizzled\". Stanza 5 none (O frabjous day...), stanza 6 same as 5, stanza 7 repeats 1st stanza with \"mandoline\" again. Stanzas 5 and 6 lack coinages, so no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming (non-canonical creature/entity named and central to action, not 'Jabberwock'): The 'Tinebar' is named as an entity/adversary central to action; not canonical. It is the 'foe' or object encountered.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: At least 2 onomatopoeic bursts required. Present are \"twanged\", \"plinked\", \"plonked\", \"blooped\", \"sproing\", \"whizzled\" — several onomatopoeic words. At least two clearly present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats in ≥2 stanzas: Examples: stanza 1 \"strings did gleam\", \"twanged\" slightly alliterative; stanza 2 \"shimmer sharp\", \"touch so\"; stanza 4 \"twanged\" \"dreadful\", \"notes\" \"went\" \"sproing\"; not very strong but at least 2 stanzas show deliberate alliteration/consonance.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: canonical order warning -> preparation -> encounter -> decisive -> return/celebration. Here: warning (2), preparation (3), encounter (4), decisive (missing), return/celebration (5). Decisive missing, so arc incomplete, no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No line exactly matches canonical poem; phrasing and words differ significantly even in repeated stanza.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical vocabulary <=8: Words borrowed from canonical poem: \"uffish\" only; \"And\" \"the\" \"he\" \"in\" \"of\" standard English; no other canonical lexical tokens detected beyond \"uffish\". So well under budget.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable pattern in quatrains: Longer lines ≈8-9 syllables, shorter ≈5-7. Sample stanza 1: '’Twas strumming(2), and the strings did gleam(5) → total ~7; 'As twanged the wild mandoline'(6-7); \"The tonebar slid with silver beam\"(7-8); \"And trembled through the pine\"(6). Lines roughly in 6-9 range, although no consistent longer/shorter line alternation in syllables. Alternation not very tight. Probably borderline no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes repeated no more than twice excluding ring echo. Rhymes \"dear/slide inside\" in stanza 2, \"day/glee\" stanza 5, stanza 7 repeats stanza 1. Not many rhyme groups reused >2 times. So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word overused >5 times or >8% of content tokens. Common words are content words like \"strings\", \"tinebar\", \"tonebar\" used a few times only. No overuse detected.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages include Tinebar (root 1), plink/plonk (onomatopoeic, same root?), bloop (root 2?), sproing (root 3?), twang (standard English but used onomatopoeically), whizzled (standard verb), mandoline (misspelling). Roots seem mixed but at most 3-4 distinct coinage roots. Probably meets threshold of ≥4 distinct roots barely.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Clearly a poem with the same narrative arc as Jabberwocky but about a musical instrument \"Tinebar\", same topic of an adventure/confrontation. Topic adhered.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: Implied layer less developed than original, but an undertone of music, overcoming fear, and joy in mastery is detectable throughout. Coherent subtle subtext present.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>no</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Actually, the stanza with onomatopoeia has 4 lines: \"And as in wispful thought he stood,\" / \"The Stubblewisp came whiffling through,\" / \"A frantic spire, a feathered flood—\" / \"It *glooped!* It *glurped!* It *splendidly* flew!\" So all 7 stanzas are quatrains. Count is within 5-8 => yes.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Check ballad-like alternating meter (line length differences in content words between odd/even lines). Lines alternate longer and shorter with sufficient content-word difference. Let's check:\n\n- Stanza 1: Lines 1 and 3 longer (\"Beware the Stubblewisp, my son!\", \"Beware the Swole, and shun the frumious fling\") lines 2 and 4 shorter (\"The flit that bites, the whirl that runs!\", \"Of starlings when the harvest’s done!\") - roughly alternates.\n\nBut throughout the poem, meter is not obviously tight or alternating as in \"Jabberwocky\"—the rhythm seems looser and less regular. Majority of stanzas do not show pronounced alternating line lengths or clear ballad meter. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Check rhymes of lines 2 and 4 in ≥60% of stanzas, and no AABB dominance:\n\n- Stanza 1: runs / done - slant rhyme — yes\n\n- Stanza 2: line 2: \"line\" ; line 4: \"time\" — rhyme? near rhyme with long \"i\" sounds, yes I/me rhyme is borderline but probably counted yes.\n\n- Stanza 3: \"through\" / \"flew\" — perfect rhyme yes.\n\n- Stanza 4: \"wide\" / no rhyme clear with line 2 (\"wide\" doesn't rhyme with \"sly\" which is line 3, but we need 2 and 4 rhyme, line 4: \"tide\") => \"sly\" (line 3) and \"tide\" (line 4) no rhyme; line 2 is \"wide\"—lines 2 \"wide\" and 4 \"tide\" rhyme well.\n\nSo rhymes present in most stanzas at 2/4.\n\nAABB not dominant (mostly ABAB or ABCB). So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza repeats some content words from opening stanza (\"’Twas brillig\" line is replaced with \"’Twas brillig still,\" maintaining reference). The last stanza also uses \"stubble\" again as a motif and \"sky\" \"dull and wide\" mirrors the earlier sky imagery; but exact repeated content phrases are minimal. The ring echo is weak or somewhat indirect; not a full clear refrain repeating ≥2 content words exactly.\n\nNo clear refrain or repeat of 2+ content words in final stanza matching initial stanza's key words, so no.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present explicitly in first stanza: \"‘Beware the Stubblewisp, my son!’\" Warns about Stubblewisp and Swole. Clearly yes.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: The protagonist \"took his net of woven twine, and set to stalk the rustling line”—shows deliberate preparation before encounter. Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter is clearly described: \"The Stubblewisp came whiffling through\", \"A frantic spire, a feathered flood\" and the protagonist attempts to catch it, the Swole intervenes. Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive slaying or resolution? No slaying or killing occurs. The net fails, Swole escapes with twine, the protagonist waves arms, but fails to capture. The tension is unresolved. So no.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration? Final stanza describes leaving with empty hand, no celebration or joyous return; rather a disappointed departure. So no.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented coinages (non-canonical, not standard English):\n\nCoinages visible: Stubblewisp, Swole, frumious (canonical? \"frumious\" is canonical from Carroll), skritched, skrawled, wispful, whiffling (canonical), frantic spire (not coinage), glurp, gloop, snicked, snapped (standard words), frabjous (canonical), chortled (canonical but not used here), ‘splendidly’ (standard English), ‘whisked’ (standard), galumphing (canonical—used?), \"beamish\" (canonical?), \"tide\" (standard).\n\nCheck carefully: \"Stubblewisp\" (coinage), \"Swole\" (coinage), \"skritched\" (coinage), \"skrawled\" (coinage), \"wispful\" (coinage), \"glooped\" (coinage/onomatopoeia), \"glurped\" (coinage/onomatopoeia), \"snicked\" (coinage/onomatopoeia).\n\nAt least 8 distinct coinages present. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza with ≥1 coinage?\n\n1st stanza: Stubblewisp, Swole, frumious (canonical)\n\n2nd stanza: skritched, skrawled\n\n3rd stanza: wispful, Stubblewisp, whiffling (canonical)\n\n4th stanza: glooped, glurped\n\n5th stanza: snicked, snapped\n\n6th stanza: frabjous\n\n7th stanza: none prominent coined words, mostly standard English: \"’Twas brillig still,\" \"sky,\" \"dull,\" \"wide,\" \"empty,\" \"hand,\" \"dreamed,\" \"tides,\" \"ride.\"\n\nNo coinages in final stanza (7th). So not every stanza has coinage. No.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>A named non-canonical creature/entity: \"Stubblewisp\" and \"Swole\" are creatures mentioned, but only the Stubblewisp is a named creature central to action; Swole is named and acts antagonistically.\n\nSwole is named and central, so yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: \"It *glooped!* It *glurped!*\" and \"It snicked and snapped\" and \"*whisked* away\" are onomatopoeic bursts.\n\nAt least two bursts present. Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance within lines in ≥2 stanzas?\n\nExamples:\n\n- \"So skritched the stubble, so skrawled the sky,\" has clear s- and sk- alliteration.\n\n- \"wings did twist and twist in time,\" repeated t- sounds.\n\n- \"The Stubblewisp came whiffling through,\" w- alliteration.\n\nSo yes, at least 2 stanzas with alliteration/consonance clearly beyond incidental.\n\nYes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration.\n\nOrder is: admonition (yes), preparation (yes), encounter (yes), decisive act (no), return/celebration (no).\n\nNo decisive act or victorious return. So arc incomplete and order not fully preserved.\n\nNo.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim canonical lines?\n\nNo lines exactly match canonical poem lines. Substantial rephrasing and original lines. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens ≤8?\n\nCanonical vocabulary used includes:\n\n- Beware, frumious, whiffling, frabjous, brillig (last stanza), callooh, callay (final stanza repetition).\n\nCount approx 8 or fewer canonical words used, mostly brief canonical words in ring-like fashion. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: long lines ~8-9 syllables, short lines ~5-7 syllables in every quatrain.\n\nCheck stanza 1:\n\nLine 1: \"‘Beware the Stubblewisp, my son!’\" = 8 syllables\n\nLine 2: \"The flit that bites, the whirl that runs!\" = 8 syllables (longer line)\n\nThis does not alternate line length as required (line 2 is not shorter). So no.\n\nAlso, other stanzas have inconsistent syllable counts and not strictly ballad-like 8/6 alternating pattern.\n\nNo.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Are 2–4 line rhymes varied across stanzas with no exact rhyme word used more than twice (excluding ring echo)?\n\nRhyme words:\n\n-(done, runs), (line, time), (through, flew), (pride, tide), (play, away), (wide, tide(?))\n\nSimilar rhyme suffixes repeat but end words not overly repeated more than twice.\n\nVariety exists.\n\nYes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no single content word overused over 5 times or >8%.\n\nContent words vary; no obvious overuse. Most repeated words are common function words or different coinages each time.\n\nYes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: 8+ coinages from at least 4 distinct roots?\n\nCoinages include: Stubblewisp, Swole, skritched, skrawled, wispful, glooped, glurped, snicked, snapped.\n\nDistinct roots at least Stubble-, Swole, skritch-, skrawl-, wisp-, gloop-, glurp-, snick-, snap-.\n\nMore than 4 distinct roots, suffixes not dominating.\n\nYes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem deals with hunting a mysterious creature \"Stubblewisp\" and an adversary \"Swole,\" reflecting the original poem’s topic of a monstrous foe and a protagonist's quest.\n\nThough substitution of creature and context is evident, it adheres to the topic of a Jabberwocky-style adventure poem.\n\nYes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied motif present?\n\nThere is an implied motif of elusive quests, struggle and failure to capture / control nature (\"dreamed of tides he could not ride\") indicating a deeper undertone of frustration and unfulfilled goals.\n\nYes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Less than 2 repeated content words/phrases strongly echoed; no clear ring composition.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Second stanza includes \"Beware the Glim, my drowsy child!\"—an admonition or warning early on, matching the caution to protagonist criterion well.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Third stanza shows preparation: protagonist \"took his scope of polished glass\" and \"scanned the heavens\" before encounter, indicating preparation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Fourth stanza describes arrival and confrontation with the Whispereve, \"whorling through the ether-flood,\" clear encounter with adversary-like entity.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Fifth stanza shows \"His lens did gleam... He left it dead (or so it seem’d),\" indicating a decisive act resolving tension, though resolution slightly ambiguous but fairly clear.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Sixth stanza features a lament and reflection, but no clear jubilant return or celebration typical for the arc; no homecoming or joyous acknowledgement shown.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Invented coinages: noctilucent, mizzled-wisp, Whispereve, glitch, star-beasts, ether-flood, whorling, vaults (some may be borderline standard or English, 'noctilucent' is a real word, 'vaults' is standard English). Coinages like \"mizzled-wisp,\" \"Whispereve,\" \"ether-flood,\" \"star-beasts,\" \"whorling\" are inventive. Distinct coinages clearly ≥8, counting compound or novel coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza has at least one coinage: stanza 1 (mizzled-wisp, noctilucent), stanza 2 (Glim, moonlit?), stanza 3 (scope is normal, but \"twilight pass\" no coinage, but \"twilight\" standard; overall at least 1 coinage), stanza 4 (Whispereve, ether-flood), stanza 5 (ghost-array), stanza 6 (frumious - canonical but counting as chapter token, glimmering - standard, no new coinage), stanza 7 (noctilucent repeated). Most stanzas have at least one coinage; stanza 6 and 7 borderline but stanza 6 uses \"frumious\" (canonical), \"glimmering\" (standard) and stanza 7 repeats \"noctilucent\" (not coined). So only some stanzas contain coinages, fewer than all. Therefore no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named non-canonical creature/entity \"Whispereve\" clearly central to action and encounter; not canonical and central to poem.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeic bursts: none clearly present. No words like 'snicker-snack', 'burbled', 'hiss', 'pop,' or other bursts; no onomatopoeia detected.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance beyond incidental present in multiple stanzas, for example \"silver bright,\" \"spectres spun from frosted sighs,\" \"veil that ripples,\" \"flicker grim,\" \"frothy fray.\" At least 2 stanzas show it clearly.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza 2) → preparation (3) → encounter (4) → decisive (5) → no strong return/celebration (6 is more lament/reflection), but the poem ends with watchfulness and dream in stanza 7. The order is mostly canonical except the return/celebration is missing or not jubilant. The last stanza is reflective, not celebratory. Since strictness demands canonical order, no, because last beat missing proper return/celebration.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines match canonical poem; wording is different and distinct phrases used. Line \"And as in uffish thought he stood,\" is repeated exactly, which is canonical verbatim line used directly, so this fails the criterion.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens present: \"uffish,\" \"frumious,\" \"beamish\" (in stanza 6). Minimal use of canonical tokens (only a few, less than 8 distinct types). So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count roughly matches Jabberwocky syllable pattern, longer lines about 8-9 syllables, shorter lines about 5-7, per stanza; well-controlled meter throughout all quatrains.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme pattern shows some repetition of rhyme pairs, no exact reuse of end words more than twice, excluding ring echo (which is weak here). Rhyme words vary sufficiently.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word overused; words like \"noctilucent,\" \"whispereve,\" \"glimmering\" appear few times, no overuse >5 times or >8% total content words; lexical repetition guarded well.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: among coined words like noctilucent, mizzled, Whispereve, ether-flood, ghost-array, star-beasts, flicker, whorling show multiple distinct roots, not dominated by a single suffix; variety ≥4 distinct roots.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem clearly addresses a Jabberwocky-type topic or narrative, about a mysterious adversary (Whispereve), with similar narrative arc to Jabberwocky; adheres to topic requirements.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied layers: underlying motifs of night, dream, confrontation with unknown, battle of perception; mood and undertone are consistent and coherent beyond surface action.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>no</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

So quatrain shape and stanza count met.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Checking meter alternation: The poem does show some pattern of longer/shorter lines alternating but not consistently or strongly in ≥60% of stanzas. Differences in content words per line are not clearly ≥2 for most stanzas. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (2,4) exists in most stanzas, e.g. rhymes like keen/done (slant), sly/rule, foe/blink, glad/bad, boy/joy, son/mind (mostly slant). AABB dominance avoided as (2,4) generally rhyme with internal variation. So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes opening stanza with repeated word \"Beware the Fid, my son!\" and thematic repetition, serving as a refrain with ≥2 repeated content words (\"Beware,\" \"Fid,\" \"son\"). Yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition is present: first stanza opens with “Beware the Fid, my son!” a clear warning to the protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: No clear stage of protagonist preparing with tool, resolve, waiting, or planning before the encounter is evident. The poem starts with warning, then immediate action. No rest or resolve stated.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: Present. The Fid acts on strands, the protagonist/choreographer presumably confronts the splicing issue, e.g. stanza 3 and 4 describe action of the Fid winding, snagging yarn, and “The sailor chortled... as the Fid did glide.”</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: Described in stanza 5 with “*snip!*—the ends were trimmed so bad, And all the splice fell loose aside.” This represents the central tension being resolved decisively.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Some jubilation in stanza 6 with “He chortled as the ends went *fly*,” and invites to arms “Come to my arms... O fiddy-fad! O twisty joy!” but no explicit return/homecoming is described. Limited, but arguably present.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage: Distinct invented coinages include Fid, fiddy-fad, tarr’d, twisty, twist-tie-tie, clack, clink, bight, splice-so-spry. Approximately 8 or more distinct coined words or neologisms present. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza has at least one coinage or invented term: e.g., Fid, clack, twist-tie-tie, frumious, fiddy-fad, splice-so-spry, clink. So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named: “Fid” is named and central to action. Fid is not canonical and drives the plot. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts present: *twist-tie-tie*, *go!*, *snip!*, *fly*. At least two distinct bursts evident. Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in at least two stanzas: e.g., “tarr’d and twisted tool,” “hitch and tuck,” “snags the yarn,” “splice-so-spry.” Multiple examples beyond incidental repetition. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (first stanza), then encounter (middle stanzas), decisive action (fifth stanza), celebration (sixth), then a repeated warning in the final stanza. Preparation stage is missing or unclear. The arc mostly follows canonical order except for preparation. Because preparation is explicit requirement, no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines from canonical poem detected, all lines original or closely paraphrased with changed content. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexicon tokens (from the known list): “frumious” (adj from canonical lexicon 'frumious' not in original but close to canonical style), “snicker-snack” is missing here. Words like “chortled” appear, which is canonical. The poem uses very few canonical tokens, fewer than 8 distinct canonical tokens. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable pattern: Longer lines generally about 8-9 syllables, shorter lines about 5-7. e.g. “Beware the Fid, my son!” (5), “Its teeth so sharp, its point so keen—” (8). Pattern roughly matched in each quatrain with alternating longer/shorter lines. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes vary and do not reuse exact end words more than twice. Multiple different rhyme sets present; no overuse detected. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word is overly repeated beyond the threshold. “Fid” repeated but appropriate as central entity; no overuse of other content words. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages derive from ≥4 distinct roots or bases: Fid, twist, tarr’d, clack, snip, fiddy-fad, splice. No single suffix dominates >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly addresses the theme of a “Fid,” a splicing tool or creature, a close analogue to the Jabberwocky theme with an armed protagonist and adversary. Topic adherence to Lewis Carroll’s style and Jabberwocky poem is maintained with reasonable thematic alignment. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: There is a subtle implied layer about skill, caution, and consequences in crafting or splicing; a motif of creation and destruction is detectible. This undertone is coherent and detectable beyond surface action. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}
