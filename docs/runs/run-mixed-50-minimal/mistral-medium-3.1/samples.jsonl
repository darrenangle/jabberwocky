Yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: stanza 5 describes the aftermath of the encounter: “He left it there,” implying resolution of the central tension (screew subdued, or subdued method implied). Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: stanza 6 contains return and jubilation: “Come to my arms, my beamish boy!” and “O frabjous day! Callooh!

Named “Screew” (or “Blithesome Screew”). Creature/entity central to confrontation and resolution.

No other onomatopoeic bursts (like “snicker-snack,” “hiss,” etc.) recognized.

Total distinct canonical tokens ≤8? Here “gyre,” “vorpal,” “beamish” count, so yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines roughly 8-9 syllables, shorter 5-7, per stanza. Checked example stanza:  \n- Stanza 1 longer lines: “In wimpling loops of azured air”—7 syllables (close)  \n- Shorter line “’Twas brinkle, and the torves did gyre”—7 syllables. Not perfect alternation or strong, mostly in range but a bit short overall. Variation seen but no strong fail. About 5 of 7 stanzas consistent. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: end rhymes in (2,4) mostly varied; no overuse of exact endings >2 times outside ring echo. Final stanza repeats “air” twice, but only two stanzas end thus, acceptable. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: no single content word overused >5 times or >8% content words except ring echo words expected.

Criterion met.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: Fourth stanza presents the Wisp coming \"whorling on its way\" and action of blades in fifth stanza. This is clear meeting between protagonist and adversary. Criterion met.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: Protagonist attempts attack (“One-two! One-two! The blades went snick-snap”), but in fifth stanza he misses and then drops his scythe in defeat. The Wisp escapes in final stanza. No decisive killing or resolution, protagonist fails. Criterion not met.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: No return or jubilant acknowledgment; rather the poem ends with a cold, still field and apparent failure (\"left... cold\"). No return/celebration.

So total distinct coinages 5. Less than required ≥8. Criterion not met.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Each stanza contains at least one coinage:  \n- Stanza 1: stubblewisp, murmurous  \n- Stanza 2: frumious (canonical), winding idiom but mostly standard words  \n- Stanza 3: no obvious coinage besides rusted (standard)  \n- Stanza 4: whorling  \n- Stanza 5: snick-snap (onomatopoeia coinage)  \n- Stanza 6: none new, only standard words  \nThus not every stanza contains ≥1 coinage.

Criterion met.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Early warning (stanza 2), preparation (3), encounter (4), decisive action (5), then no slaying and no return/celebration. The order is preserved but the arc fails on decisive action and return. Does this disqualify? The criterion expects arc beats to appear in canonical order, so the first four are present in order, last two (decisive act and celebration) partially missing. Since decisive act missing (no slaying), arc is incomplete. Criterion requires full canonical order, so no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim line check: No line exactly matches any canonical poem line.
