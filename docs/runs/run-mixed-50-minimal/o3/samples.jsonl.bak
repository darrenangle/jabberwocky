Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word is overused excessively. The named creature (Tonebar) appears several times but within a reasonable frequency. No lexical repetition problems detected. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: multiple roots used in coinages \"plinkle\", \"brangling\", \"zib\", \"twimble\", \"twangsome\", \"fluzzling\", \"clangsome\", etc. No single suffix dominates >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>The poem clearly addresses the topic of a fantastical creature named \"Tonebar\" and its defeat, echoing the Jabberwocky theme; no topic shift.
