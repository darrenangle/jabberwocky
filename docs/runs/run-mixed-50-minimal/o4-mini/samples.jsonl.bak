The meter is uneven: first stanza lines vary, but final line \"The mivverbeast began to snore.\" is longer than others. But several stanzas lack clear alternating line lengths or clear longer/shorter pattern. Overall, less than 60% stanzas show ballad meter pattern. So no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme: Check if lines 2 and 4 rhyme in ≥60% stanzas, avoiding AABB dominance. Rhyme pattern custom: stanza 1 ends (chairs/floor/affairs/snore) - floor/snore rhyme; stanza 2 (seams/claw/beams/jaw) - claw/jaw rhyme; stanza 3 (blade/sly/shade/fly) - sly/fly rhyme; stanza 4 (room/fine/gloom/line) - fine/line rhyme; stanza 5 (seat/sure/feet/furniture) - sure/furniture do not rhyme clearly, “sure” and “furniture” are slant but weak rhyme. At least 4 of 5 stanzas have clear 2/4 rhyme. Also no AABB dominance. So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: Does final stanza echo opening with ≥2 repeated content words or clear refrain? The first stanza uses \"Reglet\" and \"mivverbeast.\" Final stanza uses \"reglet\" again and furniture-related terms. “Reglet” repeats, “furniture” is thematic. But exact lines are not repeated; some key words \"reglet\" and \"furniture\" reprise. \"Reglet\" appears in stanza 1 and 5. Two repeated content words (\"reglet,\" \"furniture\") across first and last stanza. So yes.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition: Stanza 2 starts with “Beware the brumpled, rickety seams!” so clear admonition present.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation: Stanza 3: protagonist \"took his snicker-snackling blade and sought the reglet-slat so sly,\" showing acquisition/readiness; preparation act is present.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: Protagonist seeks adversary and acts (\"He gave the whirring spangle-shade\") in stanza 3. The confrontation is implicit but present.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying/decisive action: The blade and actions presumably resolve conflict; line \"He gave the whirring spangle-shade, / Then watched the crooked panels fly.\" implies successful action. So yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: Stanza 4 \"O frabjous day! The cluttered room / Now gleamed in brumious splendor fine;\" shows celebration and change, so yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinage count: Coinages appear like “drackle,” “scritchy,” “wamble,” “wavely,” “mivverbeast,” “brumpled,” “swooshed,” “grompling,” “snicker-snackling,” “whirring spangle-shade,” “brumious,” “drimsy,” “mivverbeast,” “grompling.”  \nCount distinct coinages ≥8, yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Does each stanza have ≥1 coinage?  \nYes, every stanza includes at least one coinage: stanza 1 (“drackle,” “scritchy,” “wavely,” “mivverbeast”), stanza 2 (“brumpled,” “swooshed,” “grompling”), stanza 3 (“snicker-snackling,” “whirring spangle-shade”), stanza 4 (“frabjous,” “brumious”), stanza 5 (“drimsy”). So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: “mivverbeast” named and central; not canonical. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: “snicker-snackling” is onomatopoeic derivative; “whirring” is auditory but common word. Only one clear onomatopoeia burst (\"snicker-snackling\"). No other clear onomatopoeic burst like \"hiss\", \"pop\". So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Several examples, e.g., stanza 2 “brumpled, rickety seams,” “crooked claw,” “swooshed, decluttering beams,” “grompling, groaning jaw,” and stanza 3 “snicker-snackling blade,” “spangle-shade”; so multiple stanzas with clear alliteration, yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: Sequence warning (stanza 2), prep (3), encounter (3), decisive action (3), then celebration (4). Order is maintained, yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim lines: No line exactly matches canonical poem lines, yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: Canonical tokens present are minimal or absent: \"snicker-snackling\" alludes to \"snicker-snack\" but altered; no direct use of canonical lexicon items like “brillig,” “borogoves,” “Jabberwock,” etc. Canonical tokens ≤8, yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines mostly ~8–9 syllables and shorter ones ~5–7. For example, first stanza line 2: \"Did wamble on the wavely floor;\" (7 syllables, borderline short), line 1 \"Twas drackle, and the scritchy chairs\" (8 syllables). Roughly fits Jabberwocky pattern. Most quatrains fit syllable pattern. So yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: Rhyme endings mostly varied across stanzas with no repetition >2 times. \"Floor/snore,\" \"claw/jaw,\" \"sly/fly,\" \"fine/line\" unique pairs. Last stanza 2/4 line rhyme weaker, but different endings each stanza, so yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No overuse of single content word; no word exceeds 5 times or >8% frequency outside ring echo. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages have at least 4 distinct roots: e.g. drackle, scritchy, wamble, mivverbeast, brumpled, swooshed, grompling, snicker-snackling, spangle, brumious, drimsy. No suffix dominates >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: The poem clearly parodies Jabberwocky style and topic - a whimsical fantastical encounter, preserving the obscure creature and weapons theme with action and environment described in a similar style. So yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: The poem suggests a transformation of cluttered room into a joyous place after defeating the \"furniture’s crooked claw\"—an underlying motif of overcoming disorder and bringing harmony. There is a coherent implied layer beyond surface action. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>yes</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

the last stanza is more contemplative and cautionary rather than jubilant homecoming acknowledgement.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages present include foogledusk, glimm’ring, trumble, hushish, screndled, brumpled, gloombound, drumble, zizzled, quindle-spear, brindle-blear, whelming, spangle-chime, glister-whip, frizzle-flash, nubbed, enshadowed, enkindled—well over 8 distinct invented words.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one distinct coinage word.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>No named non-canonical creature or entity central to the action; the adversary is a \"hum\" (a phenomenon, not a creature), and \"third-rail\" is a concept, not a named creature.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>No strong onomatopoeic bursts like “snicker-snack” or “Pop!” present; “zizzled” is borderline but not a clear onomatopoeic burst, and no ≥2 such expressions.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>At least two stanzas have clear within-line alliteration/consonance: e.g., “Glimm’ring rails,” “swoon and sway,” “spangle-chime,” “frizzle-flash.”</C15_think>\n<C16_think>The poem mostly follows arc order: no warning, but preparation → encounter → decisive action → no clear return/celebration; warning is not present, so arc incomplete.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>All lines are original with no verbatim matches from canonical ‘Jabberwocky’.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens like “’Twas,” “and,” “in,” “the” occur but canonical invented tokens are absent; overall canonical coinages ≤8 (actually zero), favoring new coinages.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count roughly matches Jabberwocky pattern: longer lines about 8-9 syllables, shorter lines about 5-7; most stanzas conform well.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme words at line 2 and 4 vary across stanzas, no end word repeated >2 times; rhyme variety maintained.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No single content word outside ring echo (which is absent) is overused heavily; coinages are varied; no word overused above threshold.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Multiple distinct coinage roots (foogledusk, trumble, quindle, whelming, spangle, glister, frizzle, brumpled etc.) with no dominant suffix accounting >50%.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>The poem addresses a quasi-Jabberwocky topic of encountering a strange adversary (\"third-rail hum\") with a heroic protagonist; consistent with fantastical encounter theme, clearly addressing a similar topic though with a new subject.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>The poem has an undertone of caution toward unseen danger and the muted mysteries of dusk and nighttime, suggesting a coherent implied subtext beyond the surface action.</C24_think>\n</think>\n\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>yes</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>no</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>yes</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity naming: Reglet and Furnitroar are two named adversarial entities central to the action, different from canonical Jabberwock. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: snicker-snared is derived from snicker-snack (slightly altered) and \"One cram! one snap!\" features percussive sound effects. Two onomatopoeic bursts present. Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: \nStanza 1: \"snedgy...choffer-chairs...creaking cracks\" shows consonance.\nStanza 3: \"borlix glim-repaired blade\"\nStanza 5: \"blade aloft,\" \"whirled ... dusty floor\"\nTwo or more stanzas have clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza 2); preparation (stanza 3); encounter (4); decisive action (5); return/celebration (6) is off because 6th stanza is admonitory/wisdom rather than jubilant return. The canonical order somewhat present but final beat weak or missing true celebration. Arc mostly in order but no celebration. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines found; all lines rewritten with coinages and different phrases. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens present: \"Twas,\" “brillig,” “uffish,” “snicker-snack” derivative used as snicker-snared (derivative), \"chortled\" (English), \"he,\" \"blade\" (English). Canonical tokens are few and ≤8. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines mostly 7 syllables, shorter lines ~5-7, slightly less than Jabberwocky standard (8/6) but reasonably tight. Most stanzas lines fairly uniform; not strict alternation of longer/shorter lines. Not fully meeting strong alternation but syllable counts close. Borderline, but because strict alt pattern and syllable count range per line missing, answer is no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: End rhymes at lines 2 and 4 vary across stanzas (gleamed, flaw, light, poached, more, furniture). None repeated more than twice except \"furniture\" which appears once at end stanza 6. Rhymes varied. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: No single content word overused excessively; no word appears more than 3-4 times, e.g. \"Reglet\" appears multiple times but less than 5 times. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages show multiple distinct roots: reglet, furnitroar, snedgy, choffer, lumoquilted, borlix, glim, crowched, drumble, sniker-snared - at least 5-6 distinct roots. No suffix dominance. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Poem matches the style and topic of a Jabberwocky-style poem describing a nonsensical creature/adventure like the original Jabberwocky, with original invented creatures in similar narrative.

Yes.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Clear encounter/confrontation: The poem does not depict meeting an adversary or enemy creature; rather, it is about splicing a braid. The “gusset-gree” and “wild whinnock” are mentioned but no direct confrontation described. No.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action resolving tension: Protagonist successfully completes splice “No fray nor fang remained,” indicating a resolution. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return or celebration: Final stanza’s “Sing ho! for the fid’s cunning feat” indicates jubilant acknowledgement of success. Yes.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count invented coinages: bramble-bundled, coracle crew (coracle not invented), slip-snarled, gusset-gree, wild whinnock, fid, splick, strandle, twistle, fumble-flecked, spurl, gruiv, grundle-shear, splice-dance, gnarl, four-fold braid (not coined). Counting distinct coined words ≥8: bramble-bundled, slip-snarled, gusset-gree, whinnock, splick, strandle, twistle, fumble-flecked, spurl, gruiv, grundle-shear, splice-dance = at least 10. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains ≥1 coinage: Yes, each stanza has at least one coined term (stanza 1: bramble-bundled, slip-snarled, gusset-gree, whinnock; stanza 2: fid, splick, strandle, twistle; stanza 3: fumble-flecked, spurl, gruiv, grundle-shear, splice-dance; stanza 4: none clearly coined but “fid’s cunning feat” - fid is coined from nautical term but considered coinage here). So stanza 4 borderline but fid was coined earlier, “feat” is English. Since fid is reused from before, no new coinage in stanza 4. But guideline says ≥1 coinage per stanza – stanza 4 has no new coined word—but fid is repeated coinage. Interpretation: stanza 4 contains fid again (repeated), so yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature/entity named and central (non-canonical): “gusset-gree” and “wild whinnock” are named—whinnock more like creature. Question: are they central to action? The action is splicing a braid; creatures warned about but not encountered or central. Possibly these are more like hazards or warnings but not central entity in encounter or slaying. So no clear central creature for the confrontation or slaying. No.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia (≥2 bursts): none detected (no \"snicker-snack\" type words or similar). No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in multiple stanzas: Yes, e.g., “bramble-bundled,” “slip-snarled”; “fumble-flecked,” “splice-dance pure,” “strandle, split it true” show clear alliteration. At least 2 stanzas show this.

Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical lexicon tokens ≤8: No canonical Jabberwocky words appear except “Beware” which is standard English, no canonical coinages like brillig, slithy, toves, etc. So canonical tokens effectively 0. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: longer lines roughly 8-9 syllables, shorter lines 5-7: mostly yes. Example lines: st1 line1 8 syll, line2 6 syll; st2 line1 7-8, line2 6; overall pattern acceptable. Yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: rhyme on lines (2,4) weak with only 2 stanzas out of 4 rhyming; rhyme words mostly unique; no excess repetition. Rhyme variety acceptable but overall rhyme too sparse. Question requires ≥60% rhyme presence. No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No word overused; no single content word repeats excessively. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages have multiple distinct roots: bramble, slip, gusset, whinnock, splick, strandle, twistle, fumble, spurl, gruiv, grundle, splice... at least 4 distinct roots. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: Focus is on splicing a braid, a technical action with nautical vocabulary; no mention or evocation of Jabberwock or similar creatures or story beats; thus topic is essentially different from Jabberwocky.

Need content words count or syllables. Roughly: \"Twas blorpy the reglet, and the lankie studs\" (8 CW?) vs \"Did fester and sprawl in the gerfing gloom;\" (7+ CW?) Both seem similar length and content word counts; difference unclear.  \nStanza 2: mix of line lengths but maybe no clear alternating pattern.  \nStanza 3: Possibly lines 1 and 2 longer than 3 and 4? Uncertain.  \nStanza 4: mixed lengths but no obvious strict alternation.  \nStanza 5: \"One, two! One, two! And whirr went the drill!\" (short line) vs next line. Seems shuffled.  \nStanza 6: 4 lines roughly similar length.  \nGiven the lack of clear and consistent alternating line length/content word difference in ≥60% stanzas, answer no.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Rhyme (2,4) examined:  \nStanza 1 ends: gloom / floom (likely slant rhyme)  \nStanza 2 ends: cleave / weave (rhyme)  \nStanza 3 ends: hall / wall (rhyme)  \nStanza 4 ends: prow / dow (slant rhyme)  \nStanza 5 ends: drill / same (no rhyme)  \nStanza 6 ends: dance / expanse (rhyme)  \n5 out of 6 stanzas rhyme (2,4), which is >60%—yes.  \nCheck to avoid AABB dominance: rhymes mostlyABAB-ish, or ABCB-like. Seems no AABB dominant pattern. So yes.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Ring composition: final stanza echoes opening stanza?  \n- Opening stanza references \"blorpy the reglet,\" \"furniture racks,\" and \"burling benches,\" while final stanza references the Furnivore tamed and a joyous celebration but no literal echo of any phrases or content words from the first stanza.  \n- The final stanza repeats formulaic structure and includes refrain-like phrases (\"O frabjous day! Calloo! Callay!\") like the original but no >=2 repeated content words or clear refrains from stanza 1. So no.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Warning/admonition: stanza 2 contains \"Beware the Furnivore, my child!\", clearly an admonition.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation/armament: stanza 3 describes the protagonist taking \"his greased plane in hand,\" seeking the gnarled hall, and resting by splintered stand. The mention of warming bolts by the wall indicates preparation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: stanza 4 shows the Furnivore arriving (\"came ghurpling through the dust and wood\") near the protagonist (\"as in flimdrum gloom he stood\"), implying a meeting.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive slaying/action: stanza 5 describes the battle: \"One, two! One, two! And whirr went the drill! ... He threaded the screw with craftsman’s skill, He clamped its bolt the same.\" The action solves the tension by taming the creature (not killing but decisive). So yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: stanza 6 has the celebratory scene (\"Come to my glowing hearth and dance! O frabjous day! Calloo! Callay! He chortles in deft expanse.\"), indicating return and celebration.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Distinct coinages (invented words not canonical or standard English):  \nWords like \"blorpy,\" \"reglet,\" \"lankie,\" \"fester,\" \"sprawl,\" \"gerfing,\" \"slish,\" \"slather,\" \"burling,\" \"sproot,\" \"floom,\" \"Furnivore,\" \"Grumpled Shank,\" \"glorfed,\" \"ghurpling,\" \"rattled,\" \"whirr,\" \"frabjous,\" \"calloo,\" and \"callay\" (the last three are canonical from original, so excluded).  \nCounting unique coinages excluding canonical words: at least \"blorpy,\" \"reglet,\" \"lankie,\" \"gerfing,\" \"slish,\" \"slather,\" \"burling,\" \"sproot,\" \"floom,\" \"Furnivore,\" \"Grumpled,\" \"Shank,\" \"glorfed,\" \"ghurpling,\" \"rattled,\" \"whirr,\" \"deft expanse.\" There are definitely ≥8 distinct coinages. Yes.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Does each stanza contain ≥1 coinage?  \nStanza 1: blorpy, reglet, lankie, gerfing, slish, slather, burling, sproot, floom → yes  \nStanza 2: Furnivore, Grumpled, glorfed → yes  \nStanza 3: greased plane, gnarled (gnarled is real English), splintered stand (both English), warmed bolts (English), no coinage? \"Splintered\" and \"greased\" are English but \"bolts\" is English; no coinage visible. Actually, no new coinage in stanza 3.  \nStanza 4: flimdrum, ghurpling → yes  \nStanza 5: whirr (onomatopoeic?), \"drill\" (English), craftsman’s skill (English), clamped bolt (English), no coinage besides whirr possibly onomatopoeia but may not count as coinage.  \nStanza 6: frabjous, calloo, callay (canonical, ignored), deft expanse (deft is English). \"Chortles\" occurs (carroll canonical), \"expanse\" is English.  \nThus, stanza 3 has no coinage, stanza 5 only \"whirr\" (possibly onomatopoeic but probably not coinage), stanza 6 no fresh coinage besides canonical. So only first 2 and 4 stanzas have clear coinages, others weak or none. Since coinage required in each stanza, this is no.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>A non-canonical creature/entity named and central to action (not Jabberwock): yes, \"Furnivore\" is named as the adversary; also \"Grumpled Shank\" another creature mentioned. So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia ≥2: \"whirr went the drill\" (whirr) is onomatopoeic.  \nOther onomatopoeic bursts? None explicitly like \"snicker-snack\" or \"burbled.\"  \n\"Rattled\" is not onomatopoeia but description. No second clear onomatopoeia. So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in ≥2 stanzas beyond incidental:  \nStanza 1: \"blorpy the reglet, and the lankie studs / Did fester and sprawl ...\" has some consonance (fester/floom) but weak.  \nStanza 2: \"Beware the Furnivore, my child! / The jaws that snick, the claws that cleave;\" has consonance with 'claws...cleave,' 'snick' alliteration.  \nStanza 4: \"came ghurpling through the dust and wood,\" some consonance with 'dust' and 'down' (no line 'down' actually, 'dow').  \nStanza 5: \"One, two! One, two! And whirr went the drill!\" strong alliteration of \"whirr went.\"  \nAt least 2 stanzas have clear alliteration/consonance (2 and 5). Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning → preparation → encounter → decisive → return/celebration  \nOrder checked: Stanza 2 is warning; 3 preparation; 4 encounter; 5 decisive; 6 return/celebration. Yes, canonical order maintained.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines present; there are some direct echoes of structure and refrains, but no exact line matches from original Canonical poem. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens <=8: canonical words appearing: Beware, jaws, claws, shun, frabjous, Calloo, Callay. Frabjous, Calloo, Callay appear in stanza 6. Jaws, claws, shun in stanza 2. \"Beware\" present. Total canonical distinct tokens = around 6–7, under 8, so yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: check longer lines ~8–9 syllables; shorter lines ~5–7 syllables; line lengths consistent throughout stanzas.  \nSample stanza 1:  \nLine 1: \"Twas blorpy the reglet, and the lankie studs\" ≈9 syllables  \nLine 2: \"Did fester and sprawl in the gerfing gloom;\" ≈8 syllables  \nLine 3: \"All slish and slather were the furniture racks,\" ≈9 syllables  \nLine 4: \"And the burling benches did sproot and floom.\" ≈9 syllables  \nNo clear alternating longer-shorter lines with ~8/6 syllable pattern, more uniform length. So no syllable tightness as Jabberwocky pattern.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhymes repeated?  \nRhyme end words: gloom/floom; cleave/weave; hall/wall; prow/dow; drill/same; dance/expanse.  \n\"Drill\"/\"same\" is not a rhyme—breaks rhyme pattern there. Other rhymes mostly varied. None repeated more than twice; so rhyme variety ok. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no single content word appears >5 times or >8% of content words except possibly \"the\" or pronouns. No overused content word found. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: total coinages ≥8 distinct (from C11), check if at least 4 distinct roots and suffix diversity.  \nRoots like \"blorpy,\" \"reglet,\" \"lankie,\" \"gerfing,\" \"slish,\" \"slather,\" \"burling,\" \"sproot,\" \"floom,\" \"Furnivore,\" \"Grumpled,\" \"glorfed,\" \"ghurpling.\" These vary greatly; suffixes less dominant. Coinage variety good. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: the poem clearly addresses an invented creature (\"Furnivore\") and a similar heroic encounter theme matching the Jabberwocky pattern; topic is consistent. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied layer: the poem shows a motif of woodworking or furniture-making (\"greased plane,\" \"bolts,\" \"drill,\" \"screw,\" \"clamp,\" \"splintered stand\"), with a struggle/taming of a beast related to furniture. Intrinsic metaphorical layer of craftsmanship, taming chaos, or artistry overlaps the action. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>yes</C8>\n<C9>yes</C9>\n<C10>yes</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>no</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>yes</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

stanza 1 has 3 lines, others have 3 or 4 lines; not all stanzas have 4 lines; stanza count is 4 <5; fails quatrain shape.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Lines do not show clear alternating longer/shorter pattern in ≥60% stanzas; mostly similar line lengths and no consistent content-word length difference.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>The rhyme pattern is inconsistent; for example stanza 2 has no clear rhyme (curl/glint/swirl), stanza 3 rhymes glee/keen (spoiler: glee/keen is weak rhyme), stanza 4 partially rhyme at end; fewer than 60% stanzas have rhyme on lines 2 and 4; no clear avoidance of AABB dominance but data insufficient.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes none of the opening stanza's exact phrases or content words; no clear refrain or repeated content words with first stanza.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Second stanza has \"Beware the Burrwock\", an obvious admonition early on.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Third stanza includes preparation: \"We grip the whetstone, roar burrly glee\", indicates preparation and resolve before confrontation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>No clear stanza depicts an encounter or confrontation with the Burrwock; the poem lacks a distinct meeting between protagonist and adversary.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>No decisive action described that resolves tension; no clear slaying or defeat of Burrwock is shown.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Final stanza implies return and Burrwock fading, but no explicit jubilant acknowledgement or return home celebration.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages present: glithy, brumbly, burr, snaggling, gleek, whiskerous, sliv’ring, tramplers, burrly, gloombum, snarkly; count is roughly 11 distinct invented coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Not every stanza has a coinage; for example stanza 4 has \"foam the slurry\" which may be standard English; but stanza 1,2,3 have coinages; likely each stanza contains ≥1 coinage except stanza 4 possibly borderline.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Burrwock is named (not canonical), central to the poem's threat; non-canonical creature named and central to action.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>No onomatopoeic bursts like 'snicker-snack' or 'Pop!'; \"roar\" is not onomatopoeia in burst form; no sufficient onomatopoeia present.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Some light alliteration (\"sliv’ring tusks\", \"snarkly mean\"), but only in some lines, no clear within-line alliteration in ≥2 stanzas beyond incidental; not clearly met.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: admonition (C6) then preparation (C7), but no clear encounter (C8) or decisive action (C9) before return (C10); arc sequence incomplete.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines match verbatim any canonical poem lines.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens are very few or none; \"whiffling\" appears once, \"frabjous\" once; total ≤8 canonical tokens; passes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Line syllables roughly 8-9 for longer lines seems roughly met but lines are sometimes shorter or uneven; mixed evidence but not fully consistent; borderline, leaning no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme not strong, thus cannot assess good rhyme variety; also repetition of rhyme words unclear; fails.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No evidence of excessive repetition of content words; lexical repetition guard upheld.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinages diverse with many distinct roots, no single suffix dominates; criterion met.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: clearly addresses the 'Jabberwocky'-style poem with a named creature 'Burrwock', matching story and style intent.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>No clear coherent subtext or implied motif beyond surface action; poem is fairly surface-level verse.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>no</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>yes</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>no</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>no</C24>"}
