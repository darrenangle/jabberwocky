The final stanza uses “brinkel,” “voots” (not canonical).  \nGold-standard canonical words like “beamish” and “frumpling” (not canonical, likely invented) appear but no canonical tokens like “brillig,” “slithy,” “toves,” “gyre,” etc. appear besides “beamish” in stanza 2 only.  \nCanonical tokens count ≤8 (only “beamish” maybe?), so criterion met favoring new coinages.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count tightness: longer lines mostly 8-9 syllables, shorter lines around 5-7 syllables. For example stanza 1 lines:  \n1) ’Twas brinkel and the voots did wive, (8 syll)  \n2) In zarnic groves where goblins slep— (7 syll)  \n3) All chumbled were the aching shelves, (8 syll)  \n4) And the clockmoths slowly crept. (7 syll)  \nPattern roughly 8/7 alternating. Similar pattern found in other stanzas.  \nMeets Jabberwocky’s ~8/6 syllable alternation tolerantly.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme endings vary across stanzas: slep/deep, weep/deep, hand/caught, hush/push, flew/blew, spell/wold, slept/weep. No exact reuse >2 times except on ring echo stanza repetition allowed. Variety sufficient.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word overused excessively; “the” excluded but “letter” appears a few times but under threshold (≤5).

The lines are all original, so yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens count minimal or none; only \"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\" (borrowed from original). Possibly 3 canonical tokens total - well ≤8, so yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Check syllable counts for longer ≈8–9 syllables, shorter ≈5–7 per line alternating in quatrains. Sampling stanza 1: \nLine1: ’Twas whirring, grinding, sparks did fly, (8 syll)\nLine2: In shadowed shop ’neath moonless sky; (8 syll) — both long, no alternation of length here\nLine3: The vise held fast the O1 steel, (7 syll)\nLine4: Where toothsome edge began to feel. (8 syll) — both 7-8 syll, no short lines of 5-7.\nStanza 2:\nLine1: Beware the rasp and swirling stone, (7 syll)\nLine2: Beware the dust in groans of drone; (7 syll)\nLine3: The temper danced on razor's lip— (7 syll)\nLine4: Beware the hollow grind, good grip! (7 syll)\nMostly uniform syllable counts, no clear pattern of longer/shorter alternating by 2 syllables.

Some slant rhymes and some reuse (\"sky\" twice but restricted). No end word reused > 2 times ignoring ring echo. Hence rhyme variety satisfied, yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Check lexical repetition: no singular content word overused excessively. Common English words are normal, no overuse of specific coinage or content words. So yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety depends on coinages, which are absent, so no.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem clearly addresses blade grinding, honing and forging the blade, which is consistent and not a substitution. The subject is not the Jabberwock but a metaphorical (or literal) grind. Assuming topic is \"Jabberwocky style\" poem; this poem keeps the forging theme consistently. Since no explicit topic given, accepts this, yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: beyond surface action of blade grinding, there's implied motif of preparation, careful craft, transformation, and achievement.

Probably fewer than 8 distinct non-canonical coinages. Only possibly “gloops,” “gleeps,” “grym.” Not enough for 8. No.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinage spread: Are coinages in every stanza? Only the 2nd stanza likely has “gloops” and “gleeps.” The 1st stanza no coinage except \"gryM\" only in title. \"frabjous\" and \"chortle\" are canonical.

Some canonical words used, but no exact matching lines. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens distinct ≤8: Uses some canonical words (“’Twas brillig,” “O frabjous day,” “chortle,” “came,” “as,” “in,” “he,” “and,” “the”). Total distinct canonical lexemes are about 6-7 (frabjous, chortle, brillig, etc.). Within limit.

No end word reused more than twice. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No single content word appears overused. Common English function words aside, no word >5 times or >8% content words.

There is variety in rhyme pairs; no dominance of AABB pattern (mostly ABCB or ABAB). So this criterion is met.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza echoes the opening stanza with the phrase \"’Twas brilling in the grackle-wood\" repeating the \"’Twas brillig\" structure and some coined words repeated, but fewer than 2 clear repeated content words/phrases. The last stanza also reiterates mimsy and strand-blades similar to opening. This is borderline but not strongly a ring refrain with ≥2 repeated content words; it rather reuses concepts and some words. So borderline but not definitive.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>There is an early admonition: “Beware the Fid!” shouted by the Bo’sun, clearly a warning to the protagonist. Criterion met.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>The protagonist prepares: \"spliced the strands with tumbling tips\", \"fid in fist and twistlet tight and true,\" and \"took his marlin from the rack,\" showing clear preparation with tools and resolve before encounter. Met.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>There is a clear encounter described: the strand-worm wakes and the protagonist acts with the fid. So yes, confrontation occurs.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>There is a decisive act: the strand-worm is cowed and the protagonist triumphs over it, ending the threat decisively. Yes.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration are present: shipmates shout, toast the night, and dance, expressing jubilation after the victory. Thus affirmative.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Counting distinct coinages: brilling, grackle-wood, niplik, fid, twistlet, deek, fleer, zeetling, sproingéd, marlin (used for weapon/tool), tanglelday, drompling, deave, dargle, snicked, quobbling, lunky, fumpled, shrillick, snorping, brackish joke (compound?), spanker, fid-on-four, cowed (common?), seize (common?), zig, zag, lanyard (common?), jeave, kink (common?), flinder-vest, smeared with tar and dew (common), snargle cloud, jethro, gromp, fidlings, dromple, fid-delight, splice. At least 12+ coined roots or neologisms distinctly not canonical English or from Carroll, meeting the threshold ≥8.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Checking each stanza contains at least 1 coinage: Every stanza has multiple coinages (e.g., \"brilling\", \"niplik\", \"fid\", \"twistlet\", \"zeetling\", \"fumpled\", \"shrillick\", \"snorping\", \"spanker\", \"flinder-vest\", \"snargle\", \"jethro\", \"gromp\", \"dromple\"). All 8 stanzas contain at least one.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>The named non-canonical creature/entity is the \"Fid\" or \"strand-worm,\" an adversary different from the Jabberwock. Named and central to the poem’s conflict. So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeic bursts present: “shivving, shrillick, snorping” represent bursts of sound more than once and arguably two or more onomatopoeic bursts appear; the singing of the thimble and musicality suggest onomatopoeia. At least two, so yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance in at least 2 stanzas: Examples include “spliced the strands with tumbling tips,” “twistlet tight and true,” “smiling, smeared with tar and dew,” “zig and zag,” “shivving, shrillick, snorping,” “strained and strung,” etc. So yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>The canonical narrative arc is present in order: warning (“Beware...”); preparation (“spliced the strands”, “took his marlin”); confrontation (strand-worm wakes); decisive action (fid strikes and cowed the worm); return/celebration (shipmates’ toast, dance). So yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines match canonical poem verbatim — wording and coinages are original; phrases like “’Twas brilling” differ from “’Twas brillig”. No verbatim lines from Carroll’s poem. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens from Carroll’s lexicon appear only in small amounts: “mimsy”, “mome” is in last stanza; “frabjous” adapted; \"O frabjous splice\" as a novel phrase but “frabjous” is canonical; others are new/coined. Distinct canonical tokens ≤8, favoring new coinages. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Meter/syllable pattern: Longer lines mostly range 8–9 syllables; shorter lines 5–7 syllables in quatrains. This fits pattern of alternating longer/shorter lines similar to Jabberwocky’s ballad meter. So yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: The (2,4) rhyme endings vary well across stanzas, no overuse of exact same rhyme word beyond twice, varied rhymes across stanzas. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No content word appears more than 5 times or 8% outside ring echo. Coinages and phrases are diverse and novel, reducing repetition. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: Coinages have at least 6–7 distinct roots (e.g., fid, twistlet, zeetling, sproingéd, shrillick, snorping, flinder, snargle, jethro, gromp, dromple). No single suffix dominates >50% of coinages. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>The poem clearly addresses the same topic as Jabberwocky: a mythic/fantastical creature and a protagonist’s quest. The subject is different in creature and setting but maintains the style and narrative shape. Topic adherence upheld by structure and story of similar mystical conflict. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>The poem also conveys a subtext of mastery over complexity and craftsmanship (splicing, fidling), with motifs of seamanship, skill, and triumph over nature, layered beyond surface narrative. So a coherent undertone/subtext is detectable.

Call clean!  \nHe’d forged the edge, both firm and fleet.  \n\n’Twas brillig, and the sharpness rang—  \nHoning the edge with burr and slurry;  \nAll sanded smooth, the fine tooth sang—  \nThe work was done, and none so furry.", "info": {"topic": "honing burr and slurry"}, "reward": 0.7916666666666666, "label": "medium", "criteria_yes": 19, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.7916666666666666, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 0.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_arc_order": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "C19_syllable_tightness": 1.0, "C20_rhyme_variety": 1.0, "C21_lexical_repetition_guard": 1.0, "C22_coinage_variety": 1.0, "C23_topic_adherence": 1.0, "C24_subtext": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "judge_raw": "<think>\n<C1_think>Title line present before first stanza (\"The Hone-Blade’s Grind\") -> yes</C1_think>\n<C2_think>Stanzas count is 7; all stanzas have 4 lines each (quatrains); total stanza number within 5-8 range -> yes</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Most stanzas have alternate longer/shorter lines with syllable differences approximating ballad meter pattern; about 5 of 7 stanzas satisfy this (≥60%) -> yes</C3_think>\n<C4_think>In majority of stanzas, lines 2 and 4 rhyme or slant rhyme; rhyme is not AABB dominant; meets criteria -> yes</C4_think>\n<C5_think>Final stanza echoes opening stanza with at least 2 repeated content words (\"’Twas brillig\", \"burr and slurry\") and clear ring composition -> yes</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early stanza has admonition \"Beware the whet-streak\" equivalent to warning -> yes</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Protagonist prepares by taking vise, working steadily on blade—clear preparation before conflict -> yes</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation is less clear; no apparent external creature or adversary named and met; more a metaphorical internal working -> no</C8_think>\n<C9_think>No clear decisive slaying or decisive act resolving central tension; action is blade sharpening, not combat -> no</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration indicated by joyful exclamation and recognition of completion (\"O frabjous day!\") -> yes</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Coinages include \"shivved,\" \"whet-streak,\" \"whiffle,\" and others; count is about 5-6 distinct new coinages, below 8 threshold -> no</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Not every stanza has a coinage; coinages are scattered, fewer than 7/7 stanzas with coinage -> no</C12_think>\n<C13_think>No non-canonical named creature or entity central to action; focus is blade and sharpening process -> no</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia such as \"whiffle,\" \"muffled squall,\" and \"whistled\" appear; at least 2 onomatopoeic bursts present -> yes</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Strong alliteration in multiple stanzas (\"burr and slurry,\" \"shivved and slick\", \"sharp and early\") and others -> yes</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order partially followed: warning, preparation, then a subtle encounter (whiffle), final exultation; no slaying but overall order preserved -> yes</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines match canonical poem verbatim; wording mostly different though some canonical words present -> yes</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens (“brillig,” “vorpal,” “frabjous,” “Callooh!
