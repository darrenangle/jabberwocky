Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creature/entity central to action (not Jabberwock) - \"Tanglefoot\" and \"Woggle-Claw\" named in admonition; no clear protagonist vs named creature encounter, but named mythical creatures exist and central to poem’s theme. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts: \"whif!\" is one onomatopoeic burst. Others like \"snicker-snack!\" not present. \"mumbled\", \"snuffled\" are sound-related but not clear bursts. Only one obvious onomatopoeic burst, so no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: Stanza 2 has \"snickering Snare-Webs\", repeated 'sn' sound, stanza 5 \"frumious flocks with ruffling beaks\" alliteration. At least 2 stanzas with clear alliteration. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning present early, but no clear preparation, no clear encounter, no decisive action, no return/celebration. Arc incomplete and out of order. No.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines exactly match canonical poem lines; some canonical words reused but lines are original. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens from the original poem: \"’Twas\", \"brillig\", \"slithy\", \"toves\", \"gyre\", \"gimble\", \"wabe\", \"mimsy\", \"borogoves\", \"mome\", \"raths\", \"outgrabe\", \"beware\", \"Jabberwock\", \"Jubjub\", \"Bandersnatch\", \"vorpal\", \"manxome\", \"Tumtum\", \"uffish\", \"whiffling\", \"tulgey\", \"burbled\", \"snicker-snack\", \"galumphing\", \"beamish\".\nUsed here: \"’Twas\", \"brillig\", \"slithy\", \"toves\", \"gyre\", \"wabe\", \"mimsy\", \"mome\", \"raths\", \"beware\", \"frumious\".\nMultiple canonical tokens reused but total distinct canonical tokens here fewer than 8: brillig, slithy, toves, gyre, wabe, mimsy, mome, raths, beware, frumious (frumious canonical), so more than 8 canonical tokens (frumious, beware, mome, raths, mimsy, wabe, gyre, toves, slithy, brillig =10).\nHence >8 distinct canonical tokens used. No.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable counts approximate per stanza: lines vary, with some lines >9 syllables and some shorter lines <5; no consistent longer=8-9 and shorter=5-7 pattern in every stanza. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: (2,4) rhyme varies across stanzas, no end word repeated more than twice except \"gold\" repeated in stanza 3 twice but not across multiple stanzas; variety acceptable. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No overuse of any single content word beyond allowed limits; multiple coinages and vocabulary spread; no repeated content word >5 times or >8% content words. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Distinct coinage roots show variety: woggle-, tangle-, snickering-, bramble-, snuff-, fluff-, murmuration, stich-, stutch, muffled. No single coinage suffix dominates >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: poem addresses mythical creatures, warnings, natural scene of murmuration; theme not the canonical poem but a similar mysterious mythic scene; since topic here is unspecified, assumed to be a model-written Carroll-style poem. The poem does not mis-substitute a totally unrelated topic. Yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext: poem carries implied motif of nature’s mysterious phenomena, danger, life-death cycles, with undertones in murmuration imagery (cooperation, fear, death). Coherent implied layer detectable. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>yes</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>yes</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>yes</C13>\n<C14>no</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>no</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>yes</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>yes</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}
