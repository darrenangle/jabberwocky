Coinage presence per stanza = 7/7 = 100%.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature or non-canonical named entity: no named creature central to a plot like Jabberwock or Jubjub. “snarks” are mentioned once but not central to action. The letter in the cedar box is central but not a creature name. No distinct non-canonical creature named and central.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: words like “snicker-snick” used (resembles onomatopoeia), also “whiffle”, “crunch”, “cack”, “snort” have onomatopoeic qualities though some more interpretative. At least two bursts resembling onomatopoeia present (snicker-snick, crunch). Yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration or consonance beyond incidental repeats: multiple stanzas show prominent alliteration (e.g. “frim-fram”, “wimble-bop”, “furbelows of wumblin”, “sneepings ... dredgled”, “barked”, “brolly sleep”). Clearly present in at least 2 stanzas.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order (warning → preparation → encounter → decisive action → return): arc beats are vague or absent; no clear warning, no preparation, no confrontation, no decisive action, and no return/celebration. Arc order not present.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>Verbatim canonical lines: no lines exactly match canonical poem text. The poem is original.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical token budget: canonical tokens like “snicker-snick” (not \"snicker-snack\") differ; \"snarks\" appears but is not canonical “Jabberwock”. No canonical tokens clearly reused besides the phrase \"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\" repeated once. Total canonical tokens ≤8; partial reuse of phrase still within budget.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count per line vs Jabberwocky: Mixed syllables. Longer lines often exceed 9 syllables and shorter under 5 sometimes, irregular counts, inconsistent pattern per stanza. Does not maintain approximate 8–9 vs 5–7 count consistently.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: due to limited rhyming and weak rhyme presence, rhyme variety is poor; few rhymes repeated more than twice but rhyme scheme overall weak; no robust rhyme pattern with variety.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: no single content word appears excessively; diverse vocabulary throughout; no overused content word above 5 times or 8%.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages have multiple distinct roots; no dominant suffix pattern accounts for over 50% of coinages; coinage variety well met.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Topic adherence: accessible topic is the letter in cedar box, which is not clearly the \"Jabberwocky\" theme or poem about a creature/encounter but is a narrative poem, so it deviates from usual topic of Jabberwocky or battling a creature. Topic differs from canonical poem’s subject.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext/coherent implied undertone: the poem’s language is playful and enigmatic, but a coherent motif about secrecy, letter kept safe in a cedar box, guarded by strange forces (cedar grumming, sneepings), dreams, and whispers is detectable.</C24_think>\n</think>\n<C1>yes</C1>\n<C2>yes</C2>\n<C3>no</C3>\n<C4>no</C4>\n<C5>no</C5>\n<C6>no</C6>\n<C7>no</C7>\n<C8>no</C8>\n<C9>no</C9>\n<C10>no</C10>\n<C11>yes</C11>\n<C12>yes</C12>\n<C13>no</C13>\n<C14>yes</C14>\n<C15>yes</C15>\n<C16>no</C16>\n<C17>yes</C17>\n<C18>yes</C18>\n<C19>no</C19>\n<C20>no</C20>\n<C21>yes</C21>\n<C22>yes</C22>\n<C23>no</C23>\n<C24>yes</C24>"}

Stanzas 3-7 show some rhyme or near rhyme (place/lace, joy/below, bold/hold, snap/bow, vast/past). So rhymes (2,4) hold true in about 5 of 8 stanzas (62%), but some lines are slant or weak.

Invented coinages (distinct, non-canonical, non-English standard words) are sparse or questionable.

No distinct creature named central to the action.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: The poem uses “hoo-hoo” once, which might be onomatopoeic, but at least 2 clear bursts like “snicker-snack” are required. No “pop,” “hiss,” or snicker-snack type words are present. So no.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance is weak or incidental: occasional repeated 'g' in “grind” and “grace” close lines, but not strong or pervasive across ≥2 stanzas.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>The canonical arc order seems disturbed.

Therefore, not all stanzas have 4 lines, disqualifies C2.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Ballad meter alternation requires ≥60% quatrains with longer/shorter line pattern and 2+ content-word difference.

No clear planning or tool reading before encounter.

The “fickle gear, in sudden flight” and “spun up the sun” suggests some event but no clear meeting with named adversary. Encounter unclear or weak.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action that resolves tension: stanza 5 has “He took the screw and bopped it—ay!” which implies an action that triggers “the fickle gear, in sudden flight”. This can be seen as a decisive action resolving tension.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration: stanza 5 ends with “O frabjous day! Callooh!

Nearly all stanzas contain at least one coinage.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Non-canonical creature/entity named and central: “Maw of Twit” is warned against, functioning as adversary, so yes, a named non-canonical creature is central.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia: poem uses “tick!” in stanza 6, possibly “bopped it—ay!” is more action than onomatopoeia. Only one clear onomatopoeic burst (“tick!”).

Decisive action (stanza 5). Celebration (stanza 5-6). Order partially followed but preparation missing, so no.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines: poem uses canonical interjections “O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”, but these are canonical exclamations not full lines, rest of text does not replicate exact canonical lines. Allowed to use canonical exclamations. No verbatim lines otherwise.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical budget: canonical tokens are “brillig” (once), “O frabjous day! Callooh!

Stanza 1 ends: \"tine\"/\"wone\" (slant?), \"snate\"/\"hone\" (no rhyme). Many stanzas seem to rhyme loosely or slant rhyme, but some stanzas do not have clear rhyme on lines 2 and 4, and some stanzas show alternate patterns (ABAB or ABCB).

No significant content word overlap in final stanza with opening stanza. -> no.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Yes, there is an early admonition: \"Beware the Bubbel—his grizzle is wide,\" functions as an admonition early to the protagonist.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Yes, protagonist prepares with tool or resolve: stanza 4 \"He took the grind, the furtive flail, / And whirred it sharp with a hollow wark\" depicts preparation before confrontation.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter is implied but subtle. The poem’s 3rd stanza introduces the adversary \"The Bubbel\" and stanza 6 has \"So, meet the grind, the hollow, keen...\" The encounter is more abstract but acknowledged. There is an opponent presented and protagonist interaction implied. While subtle, it exists clearly enough. -> yes.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Decisive action less clear; no explicit slaying or killing line like Jabberwock “One, two! One, two! And through and through / The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!” Protagonist sharpens blade, the adversary is introduced, but no clear decisive climax line that resolves conflict. More impressionistic, no overt resolution. -> no.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>No clear return or celebration stanza present. The poem ends on a somewhat somber, reflective note rather than a jubilant or celebratory conclusion. -> no.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count distinct invented coinages not canonical or standard English.

Each stanza contains at least one invented word or phrase. -> yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named non-canonical creature/entity named: The \"Bubbel\" is introduced and is the central adversary. It is not canonical; the Jabberwock is not named. -> yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeic bursts like \"snick-snick-snickets\" and \"hissing hum,\" \"sizzling wale\" are present. \"Snick-snick-snickets\" is distinct onomatopoeia, \"hissing\" and \"sizzling\" are somewhat onomatopoeic. At least two onomatopoeic bursts clearly present. -> yes.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>At least two stanzas show clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats: \n- stanza 1: \"slithy tine,\" \"gyre and gimble,\" \"bane on the hone\" (some alliteration with 'b', 's', 'g')\n- stanza 4: \"furtive flail,\" \"whirred it sharp,\" \"hollow wark\" (alliteration on h, f)\nAt least two stanzas meet this. -> yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: 1) admonition (stanza 3), 2) preparation (stanza 4), 3) encounter (stanza 3 and implied 6), 4) decisive act (missing), 5) return/celebration (missing).

Only 3 canonical words used (brillig, slithy, gyre, gimble) - approximates ≤8. -> yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Check syllable tightness: longer lines roughly 8-9 syllables, shorter lines 5-7. Lines mostly around 8 syllables, some longer. Alternate line length pattern is missing (see C3). Lines are somewhat variable in syllable count but many longer lines are within range, shorter lines a little longer than 7 sometimes. Mostly okay but not perfect. Because this criterion requires every stanza quatrain to meet tight syllable counts and some lines are borderline above 7 or 9 syllables, this is borderline but uncertain, so no.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: rhyme endings vary stanza to stanza; no exact rhyme end word seems reused more than twice. The rhyme is loose, but no repeated exact end word >2 times excluding potential ring effect (which is not present). Rhyme variety is acceptable. -> yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard: No notably overused content word appearing >8% or >5 times other than some filler function words. Coinages and content words are varied.

Matches style and motif without drifting to unrelated subjects. -> yes.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext is somewhat abstract and subtle, but there is a coherent underlying motif about the sharpening and confrontation with a hidden dangerous adversary, the power of the blade and the grinder's role.
