Here total is 4, so fails stanza count range.</C2_think>\n<C3_think>Check ballad meter: requires alternating longer/shorter lines with ≥2 content-word difference in ≥60% of stanzas. Sample: lines 1 vs 2 alternate? Mostly lines appear similar length; test stanza 1: “Beware…” (7 syllables approx), then “The burrows deep…” (7-8 syllables), little difference, or noticeable difference in content word count? Not clear. Overall probably no clear alternating longer/shorter line pattern. Less than 60% of stanzas with alternating line length pattern.</C3_think>\n<C4_think>Ballad rhyme (lines 2 and 4 rhyme) with no AABB dominance in ≥60% stanzas.

Stanza 3: convene/screen (perfect rhyme); cry/sky (perfect rhyme). Stanza 4 repeats 1 (same rhymes). Lines 2 and 4 rhyme in all stanzas. However, two stanzas are AABB (2 and 3: flame/game, squawk/walk and convene/screen, cry/sky - both couplets). This is contrary to requested rhyme avoidance of AABB dominance. Here 50% of stanzas are AABB; no evidence of varied rhyme scheme. So fails.</C4_think>\n<C5_think>The final stanza repeats exactly the first stanza (copy-paste). Therefore final stanza clearly echoes the opening with a full refrain (≥2 repeated content words). Ring composition evident.</C5_think>\n<C6_think>Early admonition present: the first stanza opens with “Beware the SETT-SPINNERS, my son!” a clear warning.</C6_think>\n<C7_think>Preparation or armament presence: no stanza details showing protagonist preparing tools, waiting, planning, or resolve. No direct mention of weapon/tool or preparation before encounter.</C7_think>\n<C8_think>Encounter/confrontation: No clear direct meeting or confrontation detailed; the poem references creatures and their behaviors but no protagonist encountering adversary is narrated.</C8_think>\n<C9_think>Slaying or decisive action: no description of decisive act resolving central tension; no battle or killing mentioned, no resolution action.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return/celebration: no stanza about return/homecoming or joyful acknowledgement of success.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Count of distinct invented coinages: sett-spinners, snicker-snack (canonical), frumious, badgers (not coined), tumtum (canonical), jubjub-quick (variation of Jubjub), flim-flam (common phrase), wizzle-wag, wibbly-wobbly (common playful phrase). Coinages: SETT-SPINNERS, Wizzle-Wag, jubjub-quick (partial), flim-flam (common phrase). Probably 3-4 unique coinages if we count carefully; fewer than 8 distinct coinages.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Coinages spread: not all stanzas contain coinages. Stanza 1: sett-spinners, snicker-snack; stanza 2: frumious (canonical), tumtum, jubjub-quick (borderline coinage); stanza 3: flim-flam, wizzle-wag, wibbly-wobbly; stanza 4 repeats stanza 1. So each stanza has ≥1 coinage (including slight variant jubjub-quick). Yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Creature naming: Sett-Spinners are named and central to action; Badgers (common animals) and Wizzle-Wag (likely invented creature) also appear. Sett-Spinners are the clearly named adversary creature. So yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia presence: only “snicker-snack,” which is canonical, but only one onomatopoeic burst. No second onomatopoeia found (e.g., pop!, hiss!, burbled). Fails.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance: stanza 1 “snicker-snack,” “scurry,” “son,” “sett-spinners” shows some notable alliteration. Stanza 3 “wibbly-wobbly,” “paws pattin’,” “flim-flam” show consonance/alliteration. So at least 2 stanzas with clear alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: arc beats are warning → preparation → encounter → decisive act → return/celebration. Here, warning is early; but no preparation, no encounter described, no decisive act, no return. Arc sequence incomplete and out of order. So fails.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No verbatim canonical lines present; lines are rewritten and unique except repeated first stanza, which is not canonical text. So yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens <=8: poem uses “snicker-snack,” “frumious,” “tumtum,” “jubjub” (variants), “badgers” (not canonical), “wabe” and “jabberwock” missing. Actually no “jabberwock” in model. Canonical tokens limited mostly to “snicker-snack,” “frumious,” “tumtum,” “jubjub-quick.” The count is below 8 distinct tokens. So yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable tightness: Longer lines expected ~8–9 syllables, shorter lines ~5–7 syllables. Example stanza 1: line 1 “Beware the SETT-SPINNERS, my son!” (7 syllables?), line 2 “The burrows deep where the earth-creeping run,” (9 syllables approx), line 3 “With claw-ful of dreams and a snicker-snack,” (9-10 syllables), line 4 “They chatter and scurry in moonlit crack!” (9 syllables). Longer lines slightly more than 8-9 range, shorter lines borderline or longer. Not all quatrains show alternating line length and clear syllable counts. Less than 100% satisfy syllable tightness. Since this is required in every quatrain stanza, fail.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety: lines 2 and 4 rhyme consistently, but rhyme pairs repeat: “run/crack” and “game/walk” and “screen/sky” and then the first stanza repeated as last stanza. Endings are varied; no word reused more than twice as rhyme except ring echo. So yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition: no content word clearly overused >5 times or >8% content words beyond ring echo. “Beware” and “sett-spinners” repeated, but not excessively. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages include “sett-spinners,” “wizzle-wag,” “jubjub-quick,” “flim-flam,” “snicker-snack” (canonical), “wibbly-wobbly” (common playful phrase). Coinages appear derived from at least 4 distinct roots (sett, wizzle, jubjub, flim, wibbly). No single suffix dominates.

No.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable pattern tightness:  \nLines vary and some are shorter or longer but in some stanzas longer lines are more than 9 syllables, shorter lines less than 5 or inconsistent; overall pattern loosely matching but not strict. Fail due to lack of consistent line length pattern in most stanzas. No.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>Rhyme variety:  \nRhyme words on lines 2 and 4 are \"glee,\" \"glee,\" and \"sly,\" \"bye.\"  \n\"glee\" rhymes repeated at least twice = multiple stanzas with same rhyme word.  \nNo variety in rhyme words beyond that; also some stanzas no rhyme or poor rhyme. No.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>Lexical repetition guard:  \nNo obvious content word overused >5 times or >8% of content words. \"Glibber\" occurs multiple times but unlikely to breach threshold with only four stanzas and moderate repetition. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety:  \nCoinages include glibber, wabbling, babbledom, wibbly wobble, whiffle-swoop, whiffle-snap, flit and flicker.  \nThese share roots for 'whiffle' and 'flit/flicker' is phrase, some suffix repetition.  \nBut at least four distinct roots (glib-, wabb-, babb-, whiffle-, flit/flicker) so meets variety rule.
