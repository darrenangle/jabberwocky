And back and forth / The ribboned flock did dive and soar! / They left the sky, they skimmed the stalks, / Then rose to dance once more!” which is more a battle-like action or confrontation but lacks a clear slaying or vanquishing act. No mention of death or defeat; no central tension fully resolved decisively. So no.</C9_think>\n<C10_think>Return and celebration stanza present: stanza 6 shows joy and dancing after “And hast thou seen the murmucloud? / Come twirl with me, oh gleeful day! / Oh frabjous sight!” with chortling and dancing, analog to celebration.</C10_think>\n<C11_think>Invented coinages counted: “Swoopening,” “whirlybent,” “cloudaments,” “murmucloud,” “swoopenbill,” “tumbleswarm,” “flocksome,” “stubblewood,” “airsome,” “Swish-flash,” “ribboned” (borderline English, but fanciful), possibly “whiff” (standard English), “frabjous.” Frabjous is canonical. Count at least 8 distinct new coinages not canonical or standard English, roughly 9 or 10.</C11_think>\n<C12_think>Each stanza contains at least one coinage: stanzas 1-8 all have at least one invented word such as whirlybent, cloudaments, murmucloud, swoopenbill, tumbleswarm, flocksome, stubblewood, airsome, swish-flash, ribboned (some debatable). So yes.</C12_think>\n<C13_think>Named creatures besides Jabberwock are present: “murmucloud,” “swoopenbill,” “tumbleswarm,” which seem to be creatures or entities named and central to the poem. Yes.</C13_think>\n<C14_think>Onomatopoeia bursts include “Swish-flash! Swish-flash!” in stanza 5; another onomatopoeia is less obvious; “whistling” is not an onomatopoeia burst; no clear second distinct onomatopoeic burst at least two. So only one clearly strong onomatopoeic burst. No.</C14_think>\n<C15_think>Alliteration/consonance present: Examples include “whirlybent…whiff…wings…” stanza 2, “swish and shuffle” stanza 1, “stubblewood” and “stood” in stanza 3, “wave upon wave” stanza 4, “ribboned flock did dive and soar” (ribboned and dive less alliterative). At least 2 stanzas show clear within-line alliteration/consonance beyond incidental repeats. Yes.</C15_think>\n<C16_think>Arc order: warning (stanza 2), preparation (stanza 3), encounter (stanza 4), decisive action (stanza 5), return/celebration (stanza 6), ring echo at end. Fits canonical arc order. Yes.</C16_think>\n<C17_think>No lines verbatim from the canonical poem; wording is original, no direct repeats except from first stanza in ring echo but that is allowed. Yes.</C17_think>\n<C18_think>Canonical tokens used: “Beware,” “frabjous,” “chortled,” “beamish” not present; “Did” appears, “And” appears, “O,” “Come,” “the,” and “in” appear. No direct canonical coinages like brillig, slithy, toves, wabe, mimsy, borogoves, mome, raths, outgrabe, Jubjub, Bandersnatch, vorpal, manxome, Tumtum, uffish, whiffling, tulgey, burbled, snicker-snack, galumphing, or beamish. So canonical tokens ≤8 and very low overall. Yes.</C18_think>\n<C19_think>Syllable count check: longer lines approx 8–9 syllables, shorter lines approx 5–7 syllables, consistent in quatrains. For example stanza 1 lines: line 1 “'Twas gloaming, and the whirlybent” (8 syllables), line 2 “Did swish and shuffle in the breeze” (7 syllables), line 3 “All misting were the cloudaments,” (8 syllables), line 4 “And starlings flocked with ease.” (6 syllables). Similarly for others. So yes.</C19_think>\n<C20_think>(2,4) end rhyme varied across stanzas, unique rhymes in each stanza, no repeated end word > 2 times except the ring echo stanza at start/end. Yes.</C20_think>\n<C21_think>No significant lexical repetition overuse; the word “the” is frequent but that is a function word; no content word appears >5 times or more than 8% of content words; coinages do not overly repeat with one dominating excessively. Yes.</C21_think>\n<C22_think>Coinage variety: coinages include various roots: swoop, whirlybent, cloud+, swoopen, tumble, flock, stubble, air, swish-flash, ribbon. Multiple distinct roots easily > 4; no single suffix dominates >50%. Yes.</C22_think>\n<C23_think>Poem clearly addresses the topic of an adventure/encounter similar to Jabberwocky style, with named fantastical creatures and a caution, confrontation, resolution, and celebration—all within the same subject, no topic drift.</C23_think>\n<C24_think>Subtext is apparent: motif of facing fears or observing wild mysterious phenomena; undertone of overcoming challenge or engaging with the mysterious natural world; implied motif of transformation and joy after conflict. Coherent implied layer. Yes.</C24_think>\n</think>\n\n<C1>yes</C1>  \n<C2>yes</C2>  \n<C3>yes</C3>  \n<C4>yes</C4>  \n<C5>yes</C5>  \n<C6>yes</C6>  \n<C7>yes</C7>  \n<C8>yes</C8>  \n<C9>no</C9>  \n<C10>yes</C10>  \n<C11>yes</C11>  \n<C12>yes</C12>  \n<C13>yes</C13>  \n<C14>no</C14>  \n<C15>yes</C15>  \n<C16>yes</C16>  \n<C17>yes</C17>  \n<C18>yes</C18>  \n<C19>yes</C19>  \n<C20>yes</C20>  \n<C21>yes</C21>  \n<C22>yes</C22>  \n<C23>yes</C23>  \n<C24>yes</C24>"}
