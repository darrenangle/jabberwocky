{"i": 0, "prompt": "Write a poem about underpass echo in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about underpass echo in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Let me start by recalling what makes 'Jabberwocky' unique. It's got that playful use of nonsense words, a rhythmic meter, and vivid, whimsical imagery. The challenge here is to blend those elements with the theme of an underpass and echoes.\n\nFirst, I need a title that's catchy and has a Carroll-esque ring. Maybe something like \"The Burblewock's Refrain\" or \"Echoflum's Canopy\". Let me brainstorm a bit. \"The Underwych’s Echo\" sounds mysterious and fits the quirky style.\n\nNow, the structure. 'Jabberwocky' uses quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme and a bouncy iambic tetrameter. I should stick to that. Start setting the scene of the underpass. Use made-up words that evoke the environment. Words like \"flumplenax\" or \"snicker-snack\" for the original, so maybe \"grimbulge\" for the underpass structure.\n\nNext, the echo itself. Need to personify it. Maybe the echo is a creature or a force with a voice. \"Vesper-keen\" could describe the time of day or the sound's sharpness. Words like \"glibblejaws\" and \"mimusong\" to create that whimsical feel.\n\nInclude some action, like the echo interacting with the surroundings. \"Syllables...slither, scale, and sprawl\" gives movement. Maybe a refrain that repeats with variations, like the bellman's song in Carroll's work. \"O the underwych’s echo / Flum-i-lee!\" as a memorable line.\n\nCheck the meter as I go. Each line should have eight syllables with the stress on every second beat. Let me scan some lines. \"Beneath the grimbulge where the road does slide,\" – that's iambic tetrameter. Good.\n\nEnsure the nonsense words make sense in context. \"Flishy\" for something fish-like but not quite, \"squelch-weed\" for vegetation in a damp underpass. The poem should feel like a journey through this fantastical underpass, encountering the echo creature.\n\nEnd with the echo's persistence, maybe a warning or a haunting presence. \"Beware the underwych’s echo—it plots, / A murmur prosecuting your stride, / For every sound that in darkness is sown / The flum-i-lee shall your footsteps divide.\" Adds a sense of caution, fitting the 'Jabberwocky' cautionary style.\n\nFinally, review for consistency in style, rhyme, and meter.

{"i": 1, "prompt": "Compose a poem on morning fog in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about morning fog in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. First, I need to recall what makes 'Jabberwocky' unique. It's full of nonsense words, playful language, and a whimsical rhythm. Carroll invents words that sound real but aren't, which creates that fantastical feel.\n\nSo, the focus is on morning fog. I should start by brainstorming some fog-related imagery. Maybe personify the fog as a creature or something mysterious. Words like 'mist', 'shroud', 'silken', 'twilight' come to mind. But I need to twist them into Carroll-esque terms. Let's see... \"Frosthound\" could be a creature of the fog. \"Snicker-snack\" is a term from the original, so maybe incorporate similar sounds.\n\nNext, the structure. 'Jabberwocky' has a consistent meter, primarily trochaic tetrameter. Each line has eight syllables with a strong-weak pattern. I should maintain that rhythm. Let's outline the stanzas. Start with the setting, introduce the fog as a character, describe its movement and effect on the environment, maybe some action verbs with made-up words, and a conclusion that mirrors the opening.\n\nImagery is key. The fog doesn't just lie there; it slinks, prowls, twines around things. Use alliteration and assonance for musicality. Maybe \"slinked through the sleepy dells\" or \"prowling, it twines\". The fog could have a dual nature—both eerie and enchanting. Words like \"gilded\" and \"gauze\" add that shimmering, delicate touch.\n\nNow, inventing nonsense words. \"Frosthound\" as the fog's name. \"Mome-wracks\" for the mist's effect on the surroundings. \"Borogoves\" from the original could be referenced or replaced with something similar. \"Galumphing\" is another Carroll term; maybe \"thrum\" or \"murmurs\" to mimic that sound.\n\nPutting it all together. Start with the title, something like \"The Frosthound's Prowl\" to capture that Jabberwocky creature feel. Each stanza tells part of the fog's journey through the morning. Include a bridge where the fog interacts with the environment, maybe lifting to reveal the sun. End with a warning or a lingering presence, similar to the original's cautionary tone.\n\nCheck the rhythm line by line. Ensure the syllables fit and the stresses are in the right places. Read it aloud to catch any clunky parts. Revise as needed to maintain the flow and whimsy. Avoid being too literal; embrace the nonsense while keeping the fog theme clear.\n\nFinally, review for Jabberwocky elements: made-up words, playful language, imaginative creatures, and a rhythmic, lyrical flow. Make sure the poem feels both familiar in style and fresh in content, with the morning fog as the star of its own whimsical adventure.\n</think>\n\n**The Frosthound's Prowl**  \n\n'Twas glimp in the vespertide, where mome-wracks do play,  \nA frosthound arose, with a murmur and sway,  \nIt slinked through the sleepy dells, all silken and pale,  \nWith tendrils that clung like a gilded gauze-frail.  \n\n\"Beware the throcklepox, my son!  \nIts snicker-snack jaws crunch the sun—  \nNo vorpal blade cuts through its haze,  \nTill noon's keen eye the gloom amaze!\"  \n\nIt prowled, it twined, with a wizzle and hum,  \nThrough bracken that bristled, all froth and all fume,  \nOutgrabled the brooks, all mimsy and slow,  \nAs the frosthound's breath bit the birch-limbs to woe.  \n\nIt frabjuled the thorns, it flumplenooked the air,  \nWhere whiffling bats blinked, all blind and aware,  \nYet still, oh still, came that mome-wrack thrum,  \nA dinnous din, like a vellichor's hum.  \n\nThe foghounds congregated, a gallimaufry clan,  \nThey cruddled, they crunched, with a snicker and scan,  \nBut when the morn's maw gasped gold, they thinned to a thread,  \nUnriddled, undone, as the sun's Tongue was said.  \n\nSo tread ye, ye trauvlers, when dusk dims the dell,  \nLest the frosthound's paws give your shanks a farewell—  \nIts liftles are long, and its gloam is a thief,  \nThat glibglibglops all in the raw of relief.", "info": {"topic": "morning fog"}, "reward": 0.7222222222222222, "label": "medium", "criteria_yes": 13, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.7222222222222222, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "model_id": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "model_slug": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1"}

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about desire paths in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\". First, I need to recall what a desire path is—those informal trails people create by taking shortcuts, often seen in parks or campuses. Now, the challenge is to blend that concept with Carroll's unique style.\n\n\"Jabberwocky\" is known for its nonsense words, playful language, and whimsical rhythm. So, I need to invent some fantastical terms related to paths, walking, or nature. Maybe words like \"snicker-snack\" from the original can inspire similar creations.\n\nI should start with a title that echoes \"Jabberwocky\". Perhaps \"The Desirezook\" or \"Treadledee\". Let's go with \"Treadlemire's Twist\" to give it a mystical feel. The setting should be a curious landscape, maybe a meadow or a wood, where these desire paths come alive.\n\nNext, the structure. Carroll uses quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. I'll follow that. Each stanza should introduce a new element of the path, using made-up words. For example, \"mimsy\" could become \"mimble\" to describe the terrain. \n\nI need to incorporate the idea of people's feet creating the path. Maybe personify the path itself, giving it agency. Words like \"wanderwaltz\" or \"waywrest\" might work. Also, include some obstacles or creatures, like \"thicketwyrm\" or \"burblesnatch\", to add that Carroll-esque whimsy.\n\nThe poem should have a narrative arc: introducing the path, the journey along it, challenges faced, and the outcome. Ending with a reflection on the path's creation and its fading, emphasizing the transient nature of desire paths.\n\nNow, check for rhythm. Each line should be roughly iambic tetrameter. Read it aloud to ensure the flow matches \"Jabberwocky\". Also, ensure the made-up words are consistent and fit the meter.\n\nRevise any lines that feel forced. For instance, \"Where wanderers weave their wistful way\" might become \"Where wanderwaltz their wistful way\" to keep the alliteration and invented terms. Make sure the verbs are active and the imagery vivid.\n\nFinally, the title should be attention-grabbing and fit the theme. \"Treadlemire's Twist\" suggests a turning, tricky path, which aligns with desire paths being serpentine and spontaneous.

The original has a consistent meter and rhyme scheme, often with an ABAB pattern.\n\nSo, the first step is to mimic that structure. I need to create a title that sounds whimsical and a bit nonsensical. Maybe something like \"The Burnwick Screen\" to play off \"Jabberwocky.\"\n\nNext, I should think about the theme of screen burn-in. That's when static images remain on a screen due to prolonged display. I need to translate that into the fantastical creatures and actions found in \"Jabberwocky.\" Words like \"vortext\" instead of vortex and text, \"pixelwings\" to describe the pixels sticking. Maybe \"glowstalkers\" for the static images haunting the screen.\n\nI need to maintain the rhythm, probably iambic tetrameter, with four beats per line. The rhyme scheme should be alternating, so each pair of lines rhymes. Carroll uses a lot of alliteration and portmanteau words, so I should create similar compounds. For example, \"flickerflame\" or \"glitchgloom.\"\n\nThe narrative should have a hero's journey, battling the burn-in. Start with a warning, then the encounter with the creatures, the struggle, and victory. Maybe end with a warning about the burn-in's recurrence.\n\nLet me draft some lines. \"Beware the Burnwick Screen, my son!\" mirrors the opening of \"Jabberwocky.\" Then describe the environment, like the \"visual vale\" and \"glowstalkers\" creeping. Include some action verbs like \"galumphing\" and \"whiffling,\" which are from the original poem.\n\nI need to ensure the technical terms related to screens are blended with fantastical language. Words like \"backlight beast,\" \"subpixel specters,\" \"LED Licker\" could work. Also, include the idea of the screen dimming and the burn-in setting in.\n\nFinally, wrap it up with a warning that even after defeating it, the burn-in might return if not careful.

Let me start by recalling what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It uses nonsense words that sound meaningful, a playful rhythm, and vivid, whimsical imagery. So I need to capture that essence while incorporating elements of Monte Carlo, which is known for luxury, casinos, and the Monaco Grand Prix.\n\nFirst, the title should have that whimsical touch. Maybe something like \"Monte Carlo Myrabble\"? \"Myrabble\" sounds like a Carroll-esque made-up word. Next, the structure: \"Jabberwocky\" has four-line stanzas with an ABAB rhyme scheme and a consistent meter, probably iambic tetrameter. I'll need to stick to that.\n\nNow, elements of Monte Carlo to include: casinos, roulette wheels, luxury cars, the sea, maybe the gambling aspect. But how to blend these with fantastical creatures and actions? Let's see. Instead of a Jabberwock, maybe a creature like the \"Slivovitz\" or \"Baccarat Bandersnatch\". Use terms from gambling in a fantastical way.\n\nFor example, \"Beware the Baccarat Bandersnatch\" plays off \"Beware the Jabberwock\". Then, setting scenes with terms like \"tippet\" (from the original poem) could be transformed into something related to the setting, like \"moonlit quay\" near the sea. \n\nIncorporate sounds and actions: clinking chips, spinning wheels, the hum of engines (for the Grand Prix). Maybe a stanza about a race with \"otyugh\" sounds and \"frumious\" speed. \n\nNeed to maintain the rhythm.

Maybe a resolution where they outsmart the casino's dangers.\n\nCheck the rhymes and meter. Each line should have eight syllables, iambic tetrameter. Also, ensure the portmanteau words blend gambling and fantasy. Words like \"Myrabble\" (marble + dribble?), \"flarp\" (a made-up action), \"gloryclank\" (glory + clang). \n\nNeed to make sure the poem flows naturally, with the playful language of Carroll but clearly about Monte Carlo's theme.

Maybe terms like \"wings,\" \"stage,\" \"curtain,\" \"props,\" \"backstage,\" \"footlights,\" \"spotlight,\" \"script,\" \"characters,\" \"set.\" Now, I should invent some whimsical words blending these concepts. For example, \"Wingwhif\" for the wings themselves, \"Flibloom\" for the curtain movements, \"Snickergrin\" for the stagehands' expressions.\n\nNext, think about the structure. Each stanza should have four lines with alternating rhymes. The original poem has a narrative flow, so maybe start with setting the scene in the theater, introduce the wings as alive, describe their movement, their role in the play, and conclude with their importance.\n\nCheck for alliteration and playful sounds. Use words that evoke movement and mystery, like \"shimmershade,\" \"glimmerwrought.\" Include some actions: \"twirl,\" \"swirl,\" \"beckon,\" \"whisper.\" Maybe add some creatures or metaphors, like \"Shadeborn\" for shadows, \"Glimmerwings\" for the sparkles.\n\nEnsure each stanza builds the imagery. Start with the wings' presence, then their interaction with performers, their hidden aspects backstage, and their magical contribution to the play. Use made-up verbs like \"frabjulon\" (from the original) as \"twirl\" or \"beckon.\"\n\nTest the rhyme scheme. Each stanza should follow ABAB. Read each line aloud to check the rhythm and flow, making sure it matches the original's cadence. Avoid forced rhymes; let the invented words carry the verse smoothly.\n\nNow, draft the title, maybe something like \"Wingwhif’s Loom\" to incorporate the invented word and suggest the weaving of the stage magic.

Maybe incorporate some culinary terms but twist them into Carroll-esque neologisms.\n\nThe title should be catchy and reminiscent of \"Jabberwocky.\" Maybe something like \"The Brown Butterwick\" or \"The Frumious Fritter.\" Wait, \"The Frumious Fritter\" has a nice ring, using \"frumious\" from the original poem.\n\nNow, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has four-line stanzas with an ABAB rhyme scheme. Each line is about eight syllables. I need to maintain that rhythm and rhyme. Let's break down the process of browning butter into stanzas, adding fantastical elements.\n\nFirst stanza: Introduce the setting, maybe the kitchen as a mystical place. \"Beware the Brown Butterwick, my son!\" — similar to the original's warning. Then describe the butter's transformation.\n\nNext, the sizzling and foaming. Use words like \"froth\" and \"fizzleth.\" Maybe invent a creature like \"Buttergremlin\" or \"Sizzlewack\" that appears during the process.\n\nInclude some alliteration and playful verbs. \"Twirl the spatula of might\" gives action. The climax would be the butter turning brown, with a \"nut-brown hymn\" as the aroma.\n\nAdd a stanza about the challenge of not burning it, introducing a \"Burning Beast.\" Then the triumph of the dish, maybe serving it with \"Jam-Jabber\" toast.\n\nFinally, a conclusion that mirrors the original's last lines, emphasizing bravery in the kitchen. Make sure the made-up words fit the rhythm and contribute to the whimsy.\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme and syllable count for each line. Ensure that the nonsense words make sense in context, even if they're playful. Avoid being too obscure; the poem should still convey the process and joy of cooking with brown butter.\n\nAlright, time to put it all together, keeping the language lively and the structure true to \"Jabberwocky.\" Let the poem cook like the brown butter itself, blending whimsy with culinary delight.\n</think>\n\n**The Frumious Fritter**  \n\nBeware the Brown Butterwick, my son!  \nThe sizzle that fries with the twirly spoon,  \nBeware the Fizzleth and the Froth that’s spun—  \nBy the pot where the cream doth croon!  \n\nHe took the churn-owl’s golden glare,  \nAnd stirred with a spatula’s flick—  \nLong time the milk-maids raved to share  \nThe froth of the butter’s frantic kick!  \n\nOh, twirl the spatula of might,  \nThrough the whey’s wild waltz of doom,  \nThough the Sizzlewack may bite and spite,  \nBeware the Buttergremlin’s gloom!  \n\nAnd, lo!

{"i": 12, "prompt": "Write a poem about creep in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about \"creep\" in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\". Let me start by recalling what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It uses nonsense words that sound meaningful, playful language, and a rhythmic structure. The original has a consistent meter and made-up terms like \"slithy\" and \"galumphing\".\n\nFirst, I need a title that echoes \"Jabberwocky\" but incorporates \"creep\". Maybe \"The Creep\" or \"Jabbercreep\"? \"Jabbercreep\" sounds more Carroll-esque. Now, the poem should have a narrative, perhaps a warning about a mysterious creature called the Creep.\n\nI should create portmanteau words. For example, \"slithy\" is a mix of \"slimy\" and \"lithe\". Let me brainstorm some terms related to creeping. \"Slink\" and \"slinkly\"? \"Snicker\" and \"snickered\"? Maybe \"jinkle\" for a sound that's jittery. \"Flish\" for a fish-like movement. \"Wuggle\" for struggling. \"Flishing\" could describe the Creep's movement.\n\nThe structure of \"Jabberwocky\" has four-line stanzas with an ABAB rhyme scheme. I need to maintain that. Let me outline the stanzas. Start with a warning, then describe the creature's appearance, its actions, the confrontation, and the aftermath.\n\nFirst stanza: Set the scene, perhaps at dusk with a warning. \"Beware the Creep, my son!\" mirrors \"Beware the Jabberwock\". Include some nonsense verbs like \"jinkles\" and \"wrym\". Next, describe the creature's features using made-up words. \"Eyes agleam with glim\" – \"glim\" as a shimmering light. \"Flishing\" through the air.\n\nThen, the action: it moves stealthily, sneaking and snickering. Maybe it steals something, like \"mome\" (a nonsense word from Carroll) socks or a \"jubjub's\" tail. The protagonist confronts it with a vorpal blade. The battle is brief, and the Creep vanishes, leaving behind a \"burble\" sound.\n\nFinally, the resolution: the land is safe, and the moral is to beware the Creep. Check the meter. Each line should be roughly iambic tetrameter. Read through and adjust syllables where needed. Ensure the rhymes are consistent and the made-up words fit the rhythm. Add some alliteration and playful language throughout. Let me piece it together now, stanza by stanza, keeping the Carroll vibe with whimsical words and a cautionary tale.\n</think>\n\n**Jabbercreep**  \n\nBeware the Creep, my son!  \nThe jinkles wrym, the snath’s undone—  \nBy dusk’s outgrabe, he’s never still,  \nAnd burbles on with glee distilled.  \n\nHis eyes agleam with glim did stare,  \nFlishing through air with frumious care;  \nHe snicks the mome socks from your drawer,  \nAnd snarks the tail from a jubjub’s roar.  \n\n“Beware the Creep!” the borogoves cry,  \nAs he wuggles by with a winkled sigh;  \nHe’ll frab the jam from yesterday’s tart,  \nAnd mimsy yourthreat to a has-been heart.  \n\nI sought him armed with vorpal spoon,  \nThrough tulgey woods where shadows croon.  \nHe snickered low, a frumious hiss,  \nTill I stuck the blade in his glibblen wish.  \n\nYet still he creeped, though shrunk to half—  \nA slink of borr, a fume, a laugh.  \nThe dawn arose, and he wizzle flew,  \nLeaving but ripples in glimmerglow dew.  \n\nSo heed this tale, ye mome and ye grill,  \nThe Creep’s best slain with a frabby will.  \nFor though he’s wroth but a whim-wham wight,  \nHe’ll mimsy your socks through the endless night.", "info": {"topic": "creep"}, "reward": 0.8333333333333334, "label": "high", "criteria_yes": 15, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.8333333333333334, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "model_id": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "model_slug": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1"}
{"i": 13, "prompt": "Compose a poem on awl in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, user wants a poem in the style of \"Jabberwocky\" about an awl. Let me start by recalling what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It's got made-up words that sound real, a playful language, and a nonsense verse structure with a rhythmic pattern. The original poem by Carroll has a distinctive rhythm and rhyme scheme, often ABAB quatrains with anapestic tetrameter.\n\nFirst, the title should reflect a mix of the mundane object (awl) with that whimsical, fantastical touch. Maybe something like \"The Frumious Awl\"? \"Frumious\" is a blend of \"fuming\" and \"furious,\" a portmanteau from the original poem. That could work.\n\nNow, the content. Need to create creatures and actions around the awl. The awl is a pointed tool, so maybe it's a weapon against some fanciful beasts. Let's think of some nonsense creatures. \"Snicker-snacks\" could be a reference, maybe \"bandersnatch\" but modified. \"Glintzenwings\" might be something shiny and winged. \"Mome\" is from the original, so \"momewraiths\" could be a spooky figure.\n\nThe poem should have a heroic narrative, with the protagonist using the awl to battle these creatures. Each stanza needs that rhythm. Let's check the syllables. Anapestic tetrameter is eight syllables with four beats per line, unstressed-stressed-unstressed, etc. Let me draft a first stanza:\n\n\"O, frumious awl, with blade aflame,\nIn Momewoods where the glintzenwings play,\nBeware the snicker-snacks that maul thy frame,\nAnd skewer them 'fore the dusk of day.\"\n\n\"Maul\" might not be the best word. Maybe \"Beware the snicker-snacks that gnaw thy frame,\" to keep the rhythm. \"Dusk of day\" needs to rhyme with \"play,\" so maybe \"slay the frumious fiends of day.\" Wait, original has \"and chortled in joy\" for the last line. Let me tweak the rhyme scheme.\n\nNext stanza could introduce the action of using the awl. \"So grasp it tight and charge thee well, / Through tulgey thickets, thorny, dark, and deep,\" \"Tulgey\" is from the original poem. Then perhaps a battle scene with galumphing beasts.\n\nThird stanza: \"When burbly pooks with eyes aglow, / Palliwarts in the mead\"] Hmm, maybe \"palliwarts\" are another creature. Need to maintain the nonsense feel.\n\nFinally, a triumphant ending where the awl defeats the monsters. \"And as the moon ascends the peak, / The frumious awl, now still and meek,\" giving it a peaceful conclusion after the battle.\n\nCheck the rhythm of each line. Let's read them aloud. Adjust words where the meter falters. For example, \"Beware the snicker-snacks that gnaw thy frame,\" might be better than \"maul.\" Ensure the anapestic flow.\n\nAlso, include portmanteau words and alliteration. \"Glintzenwings\" mixes glitter and wings. \"Mome\" from the original. \"Palliwarts\" could be a mix of pallid and warts. \"Gallimaufry\" is a real word but obscure, fitting the style.\n\nAlright, putting it all together with the title and stanzas. Make sure each stanza has four lines with the ABAB rhyme scheme.

It's a nonsense poem by Lewis Carroll with made-up words that sound meaningful, a rhythmic flow, and a whimsical, slightly dark adventure theme.\n\nFirst, I need to capture the essence of the third rail. The third rail is part of electric railway systems, it's dangerous, high voltage, and has that distinctive hum. The challenge is to blend that modern, industrial element with Carroll's whimsical, archaic language.\n\nThe title should be catchy and reminiscent of \"Jabberwocky.\" Maybe something like \"The Frumious Hum of the Third Rail's Sway\" to keep the alliteration and nonsense words.\n\nNow, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme.

Maybe something like \"The Science Whimsy\" or \"Labberwocky\"? \"Labberwocky\" sounds like a good blend of \"lab\" and \"Jabberwocky\", maintaining the rhyme and meter.\n\nNow, the structure. The original poem has four-line stanzas with an ABCB rhyme scheme. I'll need to follow that. Let's brainstorm some science fair elements: volcanoes, robots, baking soda, slime, judges, experiments going wrong, etc.\n\nIncorporate nonsense words. For example, \"gallimaufry\" could represent a mix of experiments. \"Quarkle\" might be a play on quarks. \"Zorbles\" could be bubbles or something fizzing. \"Groink\" as a funny sound from a volcano.\n\nStart with a warning, like the original's \"Beware the Jabberwocky.\" Maybe \"Beware the Science Fair, my son!\" Then describe the setting: gymnasium, tables with projects. Introduce fantastical elements: \"gallimaufry of slime and dreams,\" \"quarkle spoons.\"\n\nNext stanza: a robot with a \"frumious band,\" \"joints of wire, eyes of LED.\" Maybe it dances or falls apart. Then the volcano with \"frothy fright\" and \"Bubble, bubble, toil, and groink.\"\n\nInclude interactions with judges, using terms like \"burble\" and \"flair.\" Maybe a project that \"splodes\" with a \"whiffling boom.\" Conclude with a lesson learned and a return home, tying back to the beginning.\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme and meter. Each line should be roughly iambic tetrameter. Read through to ensure the flow matches \"Jabberwocky\" and the science elements are playfully integrated. Make sure the nonsense words fit the context and add to the whimsy without confusing the theme.\n\nRevise any lines that don't fit the rhythm or the style. Ensure the poem tells a coherent story of a science fair adventure with both success and mishaps, all in a playful, imaginative way.\n</think>\n\n**Labberwocky**  \nBeware the Science Fair, my son!  \nThe gym’s aflair with tables spun,  \nWhere gallimaufry of slime and dreams  \nBurble with quarkle spoons.  \n\nBeware the *Judgebot*’s frumious band—  \nJoints of wire, eyes of LED bland,  \nIt chirrups loud, “What’s your graph’s grand plan?”  \nAs it plops in its pondering pan.  \n\nWe/?*volve* the mountain, all *froth* and *fright*—  \nA zingpocket plume with cesium light!  \n“Bubble, bubble, toil, and *groink*,” I shout,  \nAs broth splashes, sudsing the rout.  \n\n“Frabjulon *stats*!” the crowd cries in cheer,  \nAs my robot trots in zigzag gear,  \nTill friction’s maw with a *zorblort* sneer  \nSends its gears to gallivant here…  \n\n’Twas brillig fun, tho’ some projects did *splat*—  \nA mome wrench, a flarp, a *clank* like that—  \nStill, ‘twas galumphing to mingle and chat  \nWhere the *sci* meets the wonder of *whimat*.  \n\nSo home we wend, thru the dusk’s soft *glow*,  \nTwo medals in hand (and a *squelch* to show)…  \nAnd whether we won, or our yeast went *phthalo*,  \nWe’ll frabjulon next year, don’t you know!", "info": {"topic": "science fair"}, "reward": 0.8888888888888888, "label": "high", "criteria_yes": 16, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.8888888888888888, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "model_id": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "model_slug": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1"}

So, I need to invent some whimsical terms related to printers and paper jams.\n\nFirst, I'll brainstorm some printer-related terms and twist them into fantastical words. Words like \"glitch,\" \"jam,\" \"paper,\" \"ink,\" \"toner,\" \"machine\" can be transformed. Maybe \"Tonerwack\" for the printer itself, \"glitchmire\" for the jam. The setting should be a fantastical place, like a \"burrow of Beelzebub's bailiwick\" to add that dark, playful atmosphere.\n\nNext, think about the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has a consistent meter and rhyme scheme, usually AABB. Each stanza is four lines, with a trochaic tetrameter. So, I need to maintain that rhythm. Let me draft the first stanza, introducing the protagonist approaching the problematic printer.\n\nThen, the action of the jam: the paper twists, the machine gnashes gears. Maybe include a battle with the jam, using whimsical verbs. The resolution would involve freeing the paper, perhaps with a \"vorpal blade\" reference, like using scissors or a tool.\n\nInclude some alliteration and playful phrases, like \"frumious fray\" or \"gallimaufry of gears.\" Make sure each stanza flows into the next, escalating the problem and then resolving it. End with a sense of triumph but caution, as in the original's warning about the Jabberwock.\n\nCheck for consistent meter and invented words that fit the nonsense style.

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about an umbrella in the style of \"Jabberwocky\". Let me recall what that style is like. \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll uses made-up words, playful language, and a whimsical, nonsensical feel. The rhythm is important, with a consistent meter and rhyme scheme. So I need to invent some fantastical words related to umbrellas.\n\nFirst, the title. \"Jabberwocky\" has a title that's one word, maybe a nonsense word. Maybe \"Brollumbry\" combining \"brolly\" (a slang term for umbrella) and \"umbry\" to sound more Carroll-esque.\n\nNow, the structure. Each stanza has a certain number of lines, maybe quatrains with alternating rhymes. Let's see the original: eight lines with ABAB rhyme scheme. Wait, \"Jabberwocky\" actually has four-line stanzas with ABAB rhyme, but some stanzas are shorter. Let me check. The first stanza is eight lines, but others vary. Maybe I can use four-line stanzas with a similar rhythm.\n\nNext, the content. The poem should tell a story with whimsical creatures and actions. Umbrellas can be personified. Maybe they dance or fight against the rain. Use alliteration and portmanteau words. Words like \"gallimaufry\" or \"frumious\" from the original. For umbrella, terms like \"snicker-snack\" maybe \"twiggle\" or \"glibble\".\n\nImagery related to weather, rain, wind. Maybe the umbrella is a hero battling the \"slithy toves\" of rain. The protagonist wields the umbrella like a vorpal sword. Include made-up verbs and nouns. Think of parts of an umbrella: ribs, handle, canopy. Give them fantastical names: \"jubjub ribs\", \"manxomehandle\", \"tulgey canopy\".\n\nNeed to maintain the rhythm, which is primarily in iambic tetrameter. Each line has eight syllables, unstressed-stressed pattern. Let me test some lines.\n\n\"Beware the Brollumbry, my son!  \nThe jaws that bite, the limbs that slap—  \nBeware the Frumious Flish that run  \nWhen Whiffling winds begin to yap.\"\n\nHmm, \"Brollumbry\" as the monster? Or maybe the umbrella itself is the Brollumbry. Let the narrative involve a battle against the rain forces. The protagonist takes the umbrella and fights, using it to defeat the rain creatures.\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme. ABAB for each stanza. Let's draft a few stanzas.\n\nMaybe:\n\nHe took the Brollumbry in hand,  \nWith Glibblejaws and Flish aflur—  \nA Tulgey shield of soggysaund,  \nHe strode into the Splinkter’s blur.\n\nThen clash’d the Rumbustious rain,  \nWith Jabberjaws in snarling flocks—  \nBut oh, that frabjul grip so vain!  \nThe Blattentwacks recoiled in shocks.\n\nWait, \"Rumbustious\" combines \"robust\" and \"rumble\"? Maybe. \"Blattentwacks\" could be a term for the wind gusts. \"Frabjul\" from \"frabjous\" in the original.\n\nContinue with the battle scene. The umbrella's canopy serves as a shield. The ribs might be made of something fantastical. Maybe in the end, the umbrella prevails, and the sun comes out.\n\nSo, putting it all together with a title and stanzas, ensuring the rhythm and rhyme match \"Jabberwocky\" as much as possible. Need to invent more words that fit the theme. Let me check the syllable count for each line to maintain the meter. Once the poem is structured, review for the whimsical feel and nonsense words that still convey the action and imagery related to an umbrella's role in battling the elements.\n</think>\n\n**The Brollumbry**  \n\nBeware the Brollumbry, my son!  \nThe jaws that bite, the limbs that snap—  \nBeware the Frumious Flish that run  \nWhen Whiffling winds begin to yap.  \n\nBeware the Jabberjaws’ sharp rain,  \nThe snicker-snack of lightning’s frill!  \nA rustling comes, a soggertain—  \nBeware, the Splinkter winks to kill!  \n\nHe took the Brollumbry in hand,  \nWith Glibblejaws and Flish aflur—  \nA Tulgey shield of soggysaund,  \nHe strode into the Splinkter’s blur.  \n\n“Twas Brillig, and the Wizzlethaws  \nDid gyre and gimble in the air;  \nAll Frabjul were the Momecaws,  \nAnd Grawlixes mome’d their lair.”  \n\nHe thrust at Throcklepox with zeal,  \nThe Wracksplosh howled and flailed in dread,  \nAs Umberell’s keen Jargons reel,  \nAnd Snicker-Snacks fled, manxomedead.  \n\nThrough Toves of downpour, thick as sloam,  \nHe charged with Brollumbry aglow—  \n“Oh, oozy Crawlux, quit thy foam!”  \nHe snathed the Snicker-Snacks below.  \n\nThe Frumious Flish did cease to slosh,  \nThe Jabberjaws retired to squall,  \nAnd as the Brollumbry’s might did slosh,  \nThe sun burst through the Galabargh’s squall.  \n\nSo keep, O Child, this Brollumbry true,  \nFor Throcklepox shall plague us still—  \n’Tis Umbra’s might, in all we do,  \nThat Flish and Splinkters cannot chill.", "info": {"topic": "umbrella"}, "reward": 0.8888888888888888, "label": "high", "criteria_yes": 16, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.8888888888888888, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "model_id": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "model_slug": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1"}

Let me start by recalling the key elements of \"Jabberwocky\". It's known for its nonsense words, playful language, and whimsical imagery, often blending real and fantastical elements. The structure typically involves quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme and a consistent meter, probably iambic tetrameter.\n\nFirst, I need to capture the essence of Monte Carlo. It's a place associated with luxury, casinos, the Mediterranean, and events like the Grand Prix. I should incorporate these elements but infuse them with Carroll's whimsy. So, maybe invent some portmanteau words or fantastical terms related to gambling or racing.\n\nThe title should be catchy and alliterative, perhaps something like \"The Monaco Mome\" since \"mome\" is a term from \"Jabberwocky\" meaning a foolish person. That fits with the gambling theme where fortunes are won and lost.\n\nNext, the structure. Each stanza should follow the ABAB rhyme scheme. Let me think of the first stanza setting the scene. \"Beware the Monaco Mome, my son!\" introduces the warning, similar to \"Beware the Jabberwock\". Then mention the \"jubjub jets\" (private planes?) and \"frumious Spa\" (a play on \"frumious\" from the original and the circuit de Monaco near the spa).\n\nFor the second stanza, describe the approach to Monte Carlo. \"Pallid palms\" for the palm trees, \"sulky sea\" for the Mediterranean. Maybe the \"ITSY BITSY band\" for live music adding to the ambiance.\n\nThird stanza could focus on the casino. \"The burbly bright roulette spins\" with onomatopoeia like \"glib-glib-grow\" for the wheel. \"Mimble mimble\" for the chips and \"mome\" going broke. Include a \"frabjulice\" cocktail, mixing gambling and drinking.\n\nFourth stanza introduces the Grand Prix. \"Avitalian autos\" for the racing cars, \"gyre\" for the track's turns. \"Fizzle frazzle\" for the engine sounds, \"flarping fans\" cheering. The checkered flag \"vawt\" and the winner's \"gallant glee\".\n\nFifth stanza could be about the aftermath, sunset over the sea. \"Galumphing\" waves and \"gallimaufry\" (a dish made from leftovers) of dreams. Ending with a warning to heed the moral about the Mome's gamble.\n\nNeed to ensure each stanza flows with the right meter and maintains the whimsical vocabulary. Check that invented words are consistent with Carroll's style and that the Monte Carlo elements are recognizable but twisted into fantastical terms. Rhymes should be clever and not forced.

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about a film camera in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" Let me recall what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It's by Lewis Carroll, full of nonsense words, playful language, and a whimsical rhythm. The original poem has a lot of made-up terms that still somehow convey meaning through sound and context.\n\nFirst, I need a title that sounds Jabberwocky-esque. Maybe something alliterative with a nonsense twist. \"The Frumious F-Stop\" combines \"frumious\" from the original (a mix of fuming and furious) with \"f-stop,\" a photography term. That works.\n\nNow, the poem structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme and a consistent meter, usually iambic tetrameter. I need to maintain that rhythm and rhyme.\n\nStart with a setting: \"Beware the Flish that floam in air\" – Flish is a nonsense word, maybe combining \"fish\" and a camera flash? \"Floam\" sounds like floating or foaming. Sets a whimsical scene.\n\nNext lines should introduce the camera elements. \"Beware the Slorbs that blur the frame,\" – Slorbs could be things that cause blur, like motion or slow shutter speed. \"Snicker-Snacks\" from the original can be referenced but with a photography twist. \"With vorpal lens and shutter’s sway\" – vorpal is from the original, lens and shutter are camera parts. \"You’ll catch the light before it strays\" – emphasizes capturing light, a key aspect of photography.\n\nInclude actions of taking a picture. \"One, two! Click the tail’s helix keen—\" – the tail might refer to the camera's strap or a part, helix adds a twist. \"Frabjous negs in tanks unseen\" – negatives (negs) developing in tanks, \"frabjous\" is from the original. \n\nProcessing the film: \"Beware the Glee of D-76’s might—\" – D-76 is a film developer, personified. \"It stirs the shadows, dark of night—\" – developing process affecting shadows. \n\nLoading film: \"The mome raths with sprocket’s spin—\" – mome raths are from the original, sprocket holes in film. \"They thread the can, the reel within—\" – loading film into a camera. \n\nShooting scenes: \"And whether hansome squop or bright—\" – hansome could be handsome, squop maybe a subject. \"The roll’s guandanclank holds tight—\" – made-up words for the film roll's mechanism.\n\nFinal stanza: \"Oh frumious F-Stop, if thou wilt—\" – addressing the f-stop directly. \"Seize dawn’s soft gleam, the dusk’s last tilt—\" – capturing different lighting times. \"Thy whiffling prints shall kyre and dry—\" – printing photos, \"whiffling\" and \"kyre\" are nonsense verbs. \"All flumplenooks the heart doth fill!\" – emotional impact of photos, \"flumplenooks\" as a made-up term for that feeling.\n\nCheck rhythm and rhyme. Each line should have 8 syllables, iambic tetrameter. Rhyme scheme ABAB. Make sure the photography terms are woven in with the nonsense words. Avoid being too technical but still recognizable. Play with sounds to mimic Carroll's style. Ensure the poem flows smoothly and the camera theme is clear despite the whimsical language.\n</think>\n\n**The Frumious F-Stop**  \n\nBeware the Flish that floam in air,  \nThe Slorbs that blur the frame’s esteem—  \nWith vorpal lens and shutter’s sway,  \nYou’ll catch the light before it strays.  \n\nOne, two!

It's full of neologisms, nonsensical words that evoke vivid imagery, and a playful rhythm with a consistent meter.\n\nFirst, I need to brainstorm musical terms and twist them into Carroll-esque words. Words like \"meowzart\" (Mozart), \"pianoramble\" (piano + ramble), \"fiddledee\" (fiddle), \"clarinetwirl\" (clarinet + twirl). The structure of \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme and a trochaic tetrameter. I should maintain that rhythm.\n\nThe poem should tell a whimsical story with a sense of adventure, perhaps a journey through the music room encountering various instruments. Maybe include some playful creatures derived from musical elements, like \"saxsquatch\" or \"trombloop\". Need to create a narrative flow: entering the room, encountering different instruments, a climax with a crescendo, and a gentle conclusion.\n\nCheck for consistency in meter. Each line should have eight syllables. Test lines like \"Beware the meowzart’s whimsy tune\" – yes, that's eight. Rhymes need to be slant rhymes where necessary, as Carroll did. Use alliteration and assonance for musicality.\n\nAlso, ensure the title is catchy and fits the style. \"The Mewzart’s Musicroom\" plays on Mozart and \"musicroom\".

Lewis Carroll's poem uses made-up words that sound meaningful but aren't, playful language, and a whimsical yet slightly dark tone. The structure is quatrains with a consistent rhyme scheme, usually ABAB.\n\nSo, I need to capture that essence. First, create a title that's a nonsense word, maybe something like \"Déjàvulgar\" to combine \"déjà vu\" with a Carroll-esque twist. Then, the first line should set the scene. Carroll starts with \"Twas brillig and the slithy toves...\", so maybe \"When mormings mimsy crawl withgrave...\" using \"mormings\" (a blend of morning and something else) and \"mimsy\" (from the original) to keep the feel.\n\nNext, incorporate elements of déjà vu—familiar scenes, confusion between past and present. Use made-up creatures or actions. For example, \"the wizzlewhacks in whirligroves\" could represent the swirling confusion. The protagonist should face a challenge, like the \"manxome foe\" in Jabberwocky. Here, maybe the \"Gloomvolk\" that whispers \"You've been here before.\"\n\nThe middle stanzas need to build the conflict, using nonsense verbs and nouns. Maybe \"Burbling brooks reverse their flow\" to show time distortion. Include a call to action, like \"Take the vorpal sword of thought...\" but twist it to relate to memory. The climax could involve confronting the feeling, \"Slay the gawgler in the maze...\" to emphasize overcoming confusion.\n\nEnd with a resolution, returning home but changed, \"And the mome raths gnash their teeth...\" leaving the reader with a lingering sense of the experience. Check the rhyme scheme, make sure each stanza follows ABAB. Use alliteration and playful language throughout. Avoid real explanations, keep it abstract. Ensure the poem flows like Jabberwocky with its whimsical logic. Read it aloud to test the rhythm. Make adjustments where lines feel forced.

Let me recall that 'Jabberwocky' by Lewis Carroll is known for its nonsense words, playful language, and whimsical rhythm. So, I need to mimic that style.\n\nFirst, I should think about the structure. 'Jabberwocky' uses quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme and a galloping meter. I'll need to maintain that. The title should be catchy and a bit nonsensical, maybe something like \"The Frumious Wings\" to incorporate a Carroll-esque portmanteau.\n\nNow, the theme is stage wings. I need to personify them and describe their role in the theater. Use whimsical terms related to theater like \"curtain's call,\" \"spotlights swirl,\" \"props,\" \"lines.\" Maybe create some nonsense verbs or adjectives, like \"flumplenooks\" or \"jowlywacks\" to give that Jabberwocky feel.\n\nIn the first stanza, set the scene with the wings waiting. Use words like \"mimsy\" and \"gallant\" to evoke Carroll's language. Then, introduce action with the curtain rising. Maybe something like \"When the mimsy moon ascends\" to indicate the start of the performance.\n\nIn the second stanza, talk about the chaos backstage. Words like \"Frumious\" (a mix of furious and tremendous), \"Burble\" (a nonsense word), and \"Wuggle\" (another made-up verb) can create that playful confusion. Mention props and actors rushing.\n\nThird stanza could focus on the climax of the play. \"Mome\" is a term from the original poem, meaning a fool, so \"Mome Wrack\" could be a character. Use \"galumphing\" to describe energetic movements. The stagehands work \"with beavers' speed\" to highlight their frantic activity.\n\nThe final stanza should resolve with the curtain falling. \"Outgrib\" means to depart, so \"outgrib the fray\" fits. The wings rest again, waiting for the next show. End with a whimsical couplet: \"Till the theatre’s wild whimsy calls / ‘Curtain up!’ another day.\"\n\nCheck for rhyme scheme and rhythm. Each stanza should have four lines with ABAB rhymes. Ensure the meter is consistent, around 8-10 syllables per line. Use alliteration and playful language throughout. Avoid being too literal; keep it imaginative and a bit absurd, just like the original.\n\nPossible adjustments: Make sure the nonsense words fit naturally and don't disrupt the flow. Read it aloud to test the rhythm. Maybe change \"jowlywacks\" to something that better fits the meter.

Let me start by recalling what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It's full of nonsensical words, playful language, and a rhythmic, almost musical flow with a consistent meter, probably iambic tetrameter.\n\nFirst, I need to capture the essence of browning butter. The process involves melting butter, skimming the milk solids, and the nutty aroma that develops. I should use vivid imagery and maybe some invented words to give it that Carroll-esque feel.\n\nThe title should be attention-grabbing and alliterative, maybe something like \"The Brown Butter's Frumious Fricassee\". \"Frumious\" is a blend of \"fuming\" and \"furious\", which Carroll used, so that fits.\n\nNow, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. I'll follow that. Start the first stanza with a warning or introduction, similar to \"Beware the Jabberwock\". Maybe \"Beware the froth, the sizzle, the crackle’s might\".\n\nNext, describe the process: melting, bubbles, the transformation. Use whimsical terms. \"Take thy cream, fresh-churned by moonlit stream\" sets the scene. Then the cooking process with \"fire’s fierce gleam\" and \"frothless, dreamless\". \n\nIntroduce the hissing and the froth rising. \"Beware the Hiss that frabjous vapors brew\" – \"frabjous\" is another Carroll term. Mention the nutty scent and the color changing. Maybe \"As whey-kissed curds in spirals magnify\" to describe the milk solids.\n\nEmphasize the patience required, as burning is a risk. \"Let none despise the watchful, wary eye\" – highlights the need for attention. The result is a \"savourous sigh\" and the joy of success. \n\nEnd with the joy of spreading it on bread, \"Taste the still-sigh of brown where gold doth lie\". Maybe a playful twist at the end, like \"Else back to churn—‘twas naught but curdled dream!\" to warn against failure.\n\nCheck the meter and rhyme. Each line should have eight syllables, ABAB rhyme. Read it aloud to ensure it flows. Adjust any lines that stumble. Make sure the invented words fit naturally, enhancing the whimsy without losing meaning. Ensure the process of browning butter is recognizable through the fantastical language.

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem in the style of \"Jabberwocky\" about interference. Let me recall Lewis Carroll's original work. It's full of nonsense words that evoke vivid, fantastical imagery. The structure is strict, with alternating rhyme schemes and a consistent meter.\n\nFirst, I need to capture that whimsical, playful language. Words like \"galumphing\" and \"frumious\" come to mind. For \"interference,\" I should think of terms related to disruption, waves, maybe technology. Words like \"static,\" \"signals,\" \"cross-talk,\" \"noise\" could work. Blend them with Carroll-esque invented words.\n\nNext, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" uses quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. Each line is eight syllables, with a trochaic meter. I need to maintain that rhythm. Let's outline the stanzas, each describing a different aspect of interference, perhaps personified as creatures or forces.\n\nStart with a title that's a nonsense word, maybe \"Flumplenooks\" or similar. The first stanza sets the scene, introducing the threat. Use alliteration and invented verbs. Then build tension with actions and challenges. Include a protagonist fighting the interference, using terms like \"jamming\" or \"filter.\" End with victory over the disruptive forces, maintaining the playful tone.\n\nCheck that each line flows smoothly, with the right syllable count. Read aloud to test the meter. Ensure the made-up words fit naturally, evoking the intended imagery. Revise any lines that feel forced or break the rhythm.

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about \"creep\" in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" First, I need to recall what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It's known for its nonsense words, playful language, and rhythmic structure, often with a whimsical yet slightly ominous tone.\n\nSo, the challenge is to take the concept of a \"creep\" and infuse it with that same whimsy and invented vocabulary. The title should probably be a mashup of \"creep\" and some nonsense suffix, like \"The Creepicker-Snipe\" or something similar. \n\nNext, I need to establish a setting, maybe a strange, dreamlike landscape. The original poem uses made-up creatures and actions, so I should create similar elements. Words like \"galumphing,\" \"frumious,\" and \"whiffling\" come to mind. For \"creep,\" maybe \"slinklepox\" or \"glibblejaws\" could work as creature names.\n\nThe poem should have a narrative, perhaps a warning or an adventure. Including a protagonist facing these creepy creatures would mirror \"Jabberwocky\"'s structure. The rhythm is also important—maintaining a consistent meter, likely iambic tetrameter, with some variations for effect.\n\nI need to ensure that the nonsense words still convey a sense of eeriness and sneakiness associated with \"creep.\" Words that sound slimy, sneaky, or slithering might help. Also, alliteration and assonance will add to the musical quality, making it feel more like Carroll's work.\n\nLet me draft some lines. Start with a warning, like \"Beware the Creepicker-Snipe...\" Then describe its features and actions. Maybe include some action verbs that are playful yet creepy. Check the syllable count to keep the rhythm consistent. Revise any lines that stumble to maintain flow.\n\nFinally, the title should encapsulate the main creature and hint at the poem's theme. \"The Creepicker-Snipe\" seems fitting.

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about an awl in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Let me recall what 'Jabberwocky' is like. It's got lots of made-up words, playful language, a rhythmic structure, and a whimsical, almost nonsense feel but with some underlying meaning.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the awl as a subject. An awl is a pointed tool used for piercing holes in materials like leather. But in Carroll's style, I should personify it and maybe make it part of a fantastical world. So the title should be catchy and a bit nonsensical, perhaps with a play on words. Maybe \"The Awl and the Oomlout\"? \"Oomlout\" sounds like a made-up creature, which fits.\n\nNow the structure. 'Jabberwocky' has a consistent meter and rhyme scheme, usually ABAB with four-line stanzas. Each stanza tells a piece of the story with vivid imagery. I need to create that same flow. Start with a setting, maybe a strange landscape. Use alliteration and portmanteau words. \n\nFirst stanza: Introduce the protagonist and the quest. Something like \"Beware the Awl, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that clutch— Beware the oomlout's frumious snout...\" Mixing real words with invented ones, maintaining the rhythm.\n\nNext, describe the journey through a fantastical environment. Use vivid, nonsense words for the setting. Maybe a \"burble\" brook, \"mome\" grass. Then introduce the awl as a tool with a mind of its own. \"He seized the Awl with manxome hand...\" The Awl should have a sinister yet whimsical presence.\n\nBuild up the action: the battle with the \"frumious Bandersnatch\" or another creature. Use words that evoke the idea of piercing and sewing but in a combat scenario. Maybe \" FOOM! went the Awl, in a turbulent streak, It stitched the Bandersnatch's griffin shriek...\" Combining the tool's function with fantastical combat.\n\nAdd some vivid, absurd imagery. \"The mimsy borogoves danced in a rout As the Awl snicker-snacked its way without...\" Incorporating creatures from the original poem but giving them new actions related to the awl's effects.\n\nConclude with the protagonist's victory and the aftermath. \"And lo! The youth stood, beamish and bright, The oomlouts fled to the yondering night...\" Keeping the triumphant yet dreamlike ending.\n\nCheck the meter and rhyme. Each line should have roughly eight syllables, with the second and fourth lines rhyming. Read through to ensure the flow matches Carroll's style. Make sure the made-up words fit naturally and contribute to the imagery.\n\nFinally, the title should reflect the central conflict or curious elements. \"The Awl and the Oomlout\" suggests a duel or encounter between the tool and a fantastical creature, which fits the 'Jabberwocky' structure of a heroic quest against bizarre foes.\n</think>\n\n**The Awl and the Oomlout**  \n\nBeware the Awl, my son!  \nThe jaws that bite, the claws that clutch—  \nBeware the *oomlout’s* frumious snout,  \nAnd shun the tulgey glade’s green hutch!  \n\nHe took the vorpal blade in hand,  \nWith threads of thorn and silken wrath,  \nLong time the manxome *borb* to scan—  \nHe sought the *Awl* of Serpentine Path.  \n\nAnd as he wandered, lost in thicket,  \nA *mome* brook babbled, *flarp* and wide,  \nWhen *WHAM!* with a *stitch* and a flicker-flack,  \nThe Awl’s sharp snout his trouser’s hide did nick.  \n\n“Beware the Oomlout’s frothy flee!”  \nThe sweating youth did frabjul exclaim,  \nFor in the mist, with eyes agleam,  \nIt loomed—a *wizzle* with tentacled frame!  \n\nHe swung the Awl with manxome might,  \nThrough *glib* gunk, through *glorp* and through goo,  \nIt pierced the beast with a *twiddle* sound,  \nThen stitched it shut with a *yarl* and a “*Soooo! *”  \n\nThe *flumplenooks* cheered, *flib* and tall,  \nAs oomlout’s *fizzle* dissolved to foam,  \nFor where the Awl had snicker-snacked,  \nOnly a *squelch* remained—*mome* and *home*.  \n\n“Let all this tale in *Galumph* be told,”  \nThe youth declared, with a beamish grin,  \nFor he’d learned well, by *jigg* and by *jog*,  \nA *stitch* in time could tame the *glint*-toothed *slith* within.", "info": {"topic": "awl"}, "reward": 0.9444444444444444, "label": "high", "criteria_yes": 17, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.9444444444444444, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "model_id": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "model_slug": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1"}

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about Layover Bay in the style of \"Jabberwocky\". Let me start by recalling the key elements of Carroll's poem. It's full of neologisms, playful language, and a whimsical yet adventurous tone. The structure is quatrains with a consistent ABAB rhyme scheme.\n\nFirst, I need to invent some nonsensical words that sound like they belong in the Jabberwocky universe. Words like \"flumplenooks\" or \"snickerfracks\" could work. They should evoke a sense of fantastical creatures or strange phenomena.\n\nNext, setting the scene at Layover Bay. It's a transitional place, a layover, so maybe it's a liminal space where travelers get stuck. I can describe the confusion and the strange sights one might encounter there. The bay could have mysterious elements, like shifting sands or eerie lights.\n\nI should include a narrative thread, perhaps a traveler trying to navigate through the bay, facing obstacles. The Jabberwocky has a clear storyline with a hero's quest, so maybe the protagonist here is trying to escape Layover Bay, encountering bizarre creatures along the way.\n\nRhyme scheme is crucial. Let me plan the quatrains with the second and fourth lines rhyming. For example, \"flew\" and \"brew\" in the first stanza. I need to maintain that structure throughout.\n\nAlso, internal rhymes and alliteration will add to the musicality. Phrases like \"silken, sad, uncertain\" in the original can be mirrored with descriptive, dreamy language here.\n\nPotential challenges: ensuring the made-up words don't disrupt the flow and that the poem remains cohesive. I should test the rhythm by reading it aloud, even if just mentally.\n\nLet me outline the stanzas. Start with the approach to Layover Bay, then the strange encounters, the attempts to leave, and a resolution, perhaps escaping or finding their way despite the confusion.\n\nCheck for consistency in meter. Carroll uses trochaic tetrameter, so aiming for a similar cadence would help. Each line should have eight syllables, with stressed-unstressed patterns.\n\nNow, drafting lines, playing with the invented words and maintaining the structure.

{"i": 32, "prompt": "Create a poem about desire path in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about a \"desire path\" in the style of \"Jabberwocky\". Let me start by recalling what \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll is like. It's got made-up words, playful language, a whimsical and fantastical tone, and a clear structure with rhyming verses and a consistent meter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a \"desire path\" is. From what I know, it's a path that emerges where people naturally want to walk, often unofficial and created by foot traffic, as opposed to planned paths. So the poem should metaphorically explore the idea of following one's desires or the paths less formally structured.\n\nNow, blending that with the Jabberwock style. Carroll uses nonsense words that often have a hint of meaning, so maybe I can invent some terms related to paths, nature, and desire. Words like \"flumplenooks\", \"snicker-snack\", \"galumphing\" come to mind from the original. I should create similar-sounding words that relate to the theme here.\n\nStructure-wise, \"Jabberwocky\" has four-line stanzas with an AABB rhyme scheme and a trochaic tetrameter rhythm. I need to maintain that structure. Let's plan the stanzas: maybe start by introducing the desire path, then the journey along it, obstacles, and a resolution or conclusion.\n\nIn the first stanza, set the scene of the path appearing where it shouldn't. Use alliteration and invented words. Next, describe the traveler moving through the landscape. Include some fantastical creatures or obstacles. The third stanza could talk about the path twisting and the challenges faced. Then, perhaps a moment of doubt or fear, followed by determination. Finally, the triumph or success of following the desire path.\n\nNeed to make sure each stanza flows into the next, maintaining the rhythm. Also, include a strong verb phrase, like \"he chortled in his joy\" from the original. Maybe something like \"with a flick of his wrist\" or \"galumphing with glee\".\n\nCheck for made-up words that still convey the intended meaning. For example, \"flibbertigibbets\" in Carroll's poem are whimsical creatures; here, maybe \"flibulous shadows\" or \"wizzle-whacks\". Also, ensure that the invented words aren't too obscure but fit the rhythm.\n\nTest the meter by reading lines aloud. Each line should have eight syllables with a trochaic beat. If a line feels forced, adjust the wording without losing the whimsy. For instance, \"‘Twas brillig and the slithy toves\" becomes \"'Twas glimmer where the wilder wove,\" keeping the structure.\n\nInclude a narrative arc: the desire path appears, the traveler chooses to follow it despite obstacles, uses some metaphorical tools (like a sword in Jabberwocky), and succeeds.

It's known for its made-up words, playful language, and whimsical imagery. The structure is traditional ballad form, with quatrains and an ABAB rhyme scheme. Nonsense verse that still conveys vivid, fantastical scenes.\n\nSo the challenge here is to blend the science fair theme with Carroll's style. Need to create portmanteaus and fantastical terms related to science. Words like \"volatube\" or \"thermoflux\" could mimic his invented language. Maybe include elements common to science fairs: experiments, projects, maybe some chaos or creatures (like robots or chemical reactions) coming to life.\n\nStart with a title. Maybe \"The Scienciock\" as a portmanteau of \"science\" and \"Jabberwock\". Then set the scene with a call to action, like \"Beware the...mnemonite...\" similar to \"Jabberwock\"'s opening. Each stanza should have four lines, with alternating rhymes.\n\nIncorporate scientific elements with whimsical twists: \"volatube\" for a volatile experiment, \"snicker-snacks\" from the original could become science tools. Maybe a mentor figure (like the \"old man\" in Jabberwocky) handing out supplies. Include some conflict, like experiments gone wrong, then resolution with a successful fair.\n\nNeed to maintain the rhythm and meter. Iambic tetrameter, four beats per line. Check syllable count to keep it flowing. Use alliteration and assonance to enhance the musicality. Play with words to create that Carroll-esque feel without being too obscure.\n\nFinally, end with a celebration of science and curiosity, tying back to the joy of discovery.

Maybe \"Frothlewock\" or \"Mistilude\"? Let's go with \"The Frothlewock'sCreep\" to capture that mysterious, creeping fog.\n\nNext, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an AABB rhyme scheme and a consistent meter, mostly iambic tetrameter. I should stick to that. Let's start setting the scene: dawn, mist, maybe some personified fog.\n\nInvent some creatures or terms related to fog. Maybe \"Momeflumes\" for mist creatures, \"Jimjam trees\" for trees affected by fog. Use alliteration and nonsense verbs, like \"wuggle\", \"wumplenooks\", \"grimplesnatch\".\n\nInclude actions that the fog does, like creeping, swirling, maybe interacting with the environment. Add a sense of movement and playfulness. Maybe the fog has a life of its own, \"gallywomp through the glimmerglass\" to give it motion.\n\nMaintain the whimsical and slightly mysterious tone. Use hyphenated compound words for that Jabberwocky feel: \"frothlewock\", \"dewsnap\", \"flibulous\", \"fizzlethorns\". Each stanza should build the imagery of the fog taking over the landscape, then perhaps retreating.\n\nEnsure each line flows smoothly with the meter. Read aloud to check the rhythm. Avoid forced rhymes but keep the AABB scheme.

First, brainstorming some elements of a conference room: tables, chairs, whiteboards, projectors, meetings, discussions, maybe coffee cups, pens, notepads. Now, how to twist these into fantastical terms.

Start with a warning, maybe about the dangers of the conference room, like \"Beware the Frumious Flapdoodle.\" Then describe the setting with invented verbs and nouns.\n\nIncorporate the meeting process: gathering, discussing, decisions. Each stanza can tackle a different aspect. Maybe include a \"Burble\" that's a mix of voices, or \"Gleeps\" and \"Snicker-Snacks\" as metaphors for meeting chaos. The climax could be the moment a decision is made, symbolized by slaying a \"Frumious Flapdoodle,\" leading to a successful outcome.\n\nCheck the rhythm.

For example: \"Beware the underpass by dusk's dim gaze,\" stresses on Beware, under-pass, dusk's, dim, gaze? Hmm, maybe adjust that. \"Beware the underpass by dusk's pale gaze\" might flow better.\n\nIncorporate some neologisms: \"frothglit,\" \"splinches,\" \"flabulum,\" \"gallishades.\" These words should hint at their meanings through context. The echo \"flibbertigibbet\" suggests it's whimsical or flighty. The shadows \"tatterfoal\" could mean tattered and foal-like, moving unpredictably.\n\nMake sure the last stanza ties back to the title and the echo's effect. The traveler is both intrigued and warned, leaving the reader with that eerie, memorable feeling from \"Jabberwocky.\"\n\nOkay, putting it all together. Title first, then stanzas with the made-up words, maintaining the rhythm and rhyme. Check each line's meter and adjust where necessary. Ensure the echo is portrayed as a creature that interacts with the traveler, using vivid, fantastical language.\n</think>\n\n**The Underpass Frumious**  \n\nBeware the underpass by dusk’s pale gaze,  \nWhere frothglit splinches dance in hollowed ways.  \nThe mimsy flibbertigibbet starts to tease,  \nA frabjul echo all in gallishades.  \n\nBeware the gralloch-stoned and weresome winds  \nThat whiffling riffle through the tatterfoal shadows.  \nThe snicker-snack of heels on flabulum spines—  \nA jabber opaline the void bestows.  \n\n“O mome wrack,” the traveler begins to call,  \n“Will vorpal light unsnarl this wuggle’s might?”  \nThe underpass, a gallivanting thrall,  \nBelches back riddles, cold and sluice-gate bright.  \n\n“Flee now,” hums the echo, “ere the glim-glam’s peak,  \nWhen burbles foam and zingpocketed night  \nShall gobble all in brackish, blorple shriek—  \nAnd frumious whispers claw the dark’s last light.”  \n\nSo shun that underpass, the frabjulous lair,  \nWhere whimsy gnaws and vendelbully crawls.  \nLest thou, in frothglit snick, become its prayer—  \nA phantom sound that zongs through gallishalls.", "info": {"topic": "underpass echo"}, "reward": 0.6111111111111112, "label": "medium", "criteria_yes": 11, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.6111111111111112, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "model_id": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "model_slug": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1"}

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about déjà vu in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Let me start by recalling what 'Jabberwocky' is like. It's a nonsense poem by Lewis Carroll with made-up words, playful language, and a whimsical rhythm. So I need to capture that whimsy and invent some terms related to déjà vu.\n\nFirst, the title. 'Jabberwocky' has a unique title, so maybe something like \"The Déjà Vu Frumious\" to blend the French term with Carroll's style. Next, the structure. The original has a consistent meter and rhyme scheme, usually ABAB. I should follow that.\n\nDeja vu is that feeling of familiarity. I need to personify it, maybe as a creature or a phenomenon. Carroll uses creatures like the Jabberwock, so perhaps something like \"the Snicker-Snack of When\" or \"the vorpal Glint of Yore\". Those phrases have a Carroll-esque ring.\n\nIncorporate some of the original's phrases subtly, like \"Beware the...\" and \"my son\". Then build stanzas around the experience of deja vu: confusion, time loops, memory tricks. Use alliteration and rhyming nonsense words. Maybe lines like \"The mome waltzes, the mimsy sway\" to mimic the rhythm.\n\nCheck the meter. Each line should be eight syllables, with a trochaic tetrameter. Let me draft a few lines and see. For example:\n\n\"Beware the Déjà’s frumious grin,\nMy son, with its blerjum spin,\nA whiffling space where moments twine—\n‘Tis a loop of mind, all yours and mine.\"\n\nThat seems to fit. Continue with the confusion of time, the uncertainty. Maybe add a stanza where the protagonist confronts the feeling, only to realize it's elusive. End with a whimsical twist, like the feeling escaping or the speaker questioning reality.\n\nEnsure the made-up words sound plausible within the poem's context. Words like \"blerjum\", \"flibulous haze\", \"throcklepox of When\" should evoke curiosity without being too obscure. Maintain the playful tone throughout, mixing real and invented language.\n\nOnce the stanzas are drafted, read through to check flow and rhyme. Adjust any lines that stumble or break the meter. Finally, add a title that's catchy and fits the 'Jabberwocky' style.

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about a music room in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. First, I need to recall what makes 'Jabberwocky' unique. It's by Lewis Carroll, right? The key elements are neologisms, playful language, nonsense words that sound meaningful, and a rhythmic, lyrical structure.\n\nSo the task is to create a similar poem. The title should probably be a nonsense word, maybe a combination of musical terms and 'jubjub' or 'bandersnatch' like Carroll did. Let me think... \"Jabberwocky\" has words like \"slithy\", \"mome\", \"frumious\". I need to invent words that sound musical or related to instruments.\n\nThe music room setting: maybe instruments that come alive, whimsical creatures made of music notes or instruments. The poem should have a narrative, perhaps a quest or encountering fantastical beings. Carroll uses a lot of alliteration and assonance, so I should focus on that.\n\nStart with the title. Maybe \"The Mimsy Melodiitre\" – \"mimsy\" is from the original, and \"Melodiitre\" combines melody with a creature-like suffix. Then the first stanza sets the scene. \"Beware the Solfa and the Shrieves of createTime\" – Solfa relates to solfège, Shrieves could be a mix of shriek and leaves. \"createTime\" instead of \"crutch time\" or something time-related.\n\nNext, the music room itself. \"Tumtum ersatz in harmony's maze\" – Tumtum is a drum, ersatz means substitute, harmony's maze gives a sense of winding through music. Then action verbs: \"Beware the waltz-wumps and the crescendo’s blare\" – waltz-wumps as a nonsense creature, crescendo's blare for loud sounds.\n\nInventing creatures: \"Frabjulon fifes\" – frabjulon from \"frabjous\" in the original, fifes as flutes. \"Mingled with throcklepox\" – throcklepox sounds like a made-up instrument or creature. \"Gleebeasts\" combining glee and beasts, \"fiddledee bows\" with \"fiddle\" and a playful \"dee\".\n\nIncluding a plot where the protagonist interacts with these creatures. \"So I brandished a baton of boom and of sway\" – conducting with a baton, \" crashcleff\" combining crash and clef. \"Jingled the jim-jam in jollivet’s spin\" – alliteration and playful actions.\n\nCrescendo towards the end: \"The Shrieves all shrank from the melody’s roar!\" – the creatures react to the music. \"My Solfa I slew with a rondo’s refrain\" – defeating the Solfa creature with a musical term rondo. Ending with \"Then burbled the bassoons, ‘Bravo! Encore!’\" – instruments reacting positively.\n\nNeed to check the meter and rhyme scheme. 'Jabberwocky' is in quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme, alternating lines of iambic tetrameter and trimeter. Let me verify each stanza's rhythm and rhyme. Also, ensure that the made-up words blend seamlessly with real musical terms to maintain the whimsical feel without being too obscure.\n\nRevise any lines that don't flow smoothly, ensuring the nonsense words contribute to the musical theme. Make sure the title fits the structure and the overall poem captures the essence of a lively, fantastical music room as per Carroll's style.\n</think>\n\n**The Mimsy Melodiitre**  \n\nBeware the Solfa and the Shrieves of createTime,  \nThe flumplenooks that flibbertigibbet and scorn.  \nBeware the Jabberflute’s jazz-haunted chime  \nAnd the maelstrom that mumbles where metronomes yawn.  \n\n‘Twas brillig and the b.AddRange bled mellow,  \nAll whimsy-whirled were the waltzers of sound;  \nTumtum ersatz in harmony’s maze did dwell,  \nWhile the voxlooms burbled by bends of the ground.  \n\nI chortled in my clavecin’s cucurbit glove,  \n“Eftsoons I’ll rout this cacophonous horde!”  \nI seized a splink and a gliss of vapor-love,  \nThen grimbulged through the gamut, a trill to abhor.  \n\nBeware the waltz-wumps and the crescendo’s blare!  \nThe frabjulon fifes and the throcklepox throng,  \nBeware the gleebeasts’ fiddledee bows of air—  \nOne snicker-SOAP and thy souffle is wrong!  \n\nI galumphed through the glissando’s glimmer-gleam,  \nWhere tremolos tumbled in trills of disdain,  \nBut mome rhapsodes mumbled a moonlit theme,  \nAs IBacking opforte through thirds in the rain.  \n\nSo I brandished a baton of boom and of sway,  \nCrashcleff the crescendo in cotillions of fire,  \nJingled the jim-jam in jollivet’s spin—  \n“Frumious fanfares, I’ll frazzle thy mire!”  \n\nThe Shrieves all shrank from the melody’s roar!  \nMy Solfa I slew with a rondo’s refrain;  \nThe melodiitre mewed, “Mimsy no more!”  \nThen burbled the bassoons, “Bravo!

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about Layover Bay in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\". Let me start by recalling what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It's known for its nonsense words, playful language, and whimsical imagery. The structure is important too—it has a consistent rhyme scheme and meter, usually quatrains with an AABB rhyme scheme and trochaic tetrameter.\n\nFirst, I need to incorporate made-up words that evoke a sense of wonder and confusion, similar to Carroll's approach. Words like \"slithy\" or \"mome\" come to mind. So for Layover Bay, maybe I can create terms that sound nautical or aviation-related but with a twist. \n\nThe title should be catchy and maybe a bit of a mouthful, like \"The Layclocky Shore\". That rhymes with Jabberwocky and has a similar ring. Now, the setting: a bay that's a layover, so perhaps a place between destinations, a liminal space. I need to describe the creatures or features of this bay using nonsense words. \n\nImagery related to travel, waiting, maybe some fantastical elements. For example, \"flumplenooks\" could be birds or creatures that inhabit the area. \"Snicker-Snacks\" from the original could be referenced, maybe as something the traveler uses or encounters. \n\nThe rhythm and meter are crucial. Each line should have eight syllables with a trochaic beat. Let me draft a few lines and check the syllable count. \n\n\"Beware the Layclocky Shore,\nWhere flibberjays froth and roar,\"\n\nYes, that's eight syllables each. Now, the story: a traveler arrives at Layover Bay, encounters strange things, and perhaps has to navigate through them. The poem should have a sense of adventure and urgency, mirroring the original's quest narrative. \n\nIncorporate some of Carroll's techniques like alliteration and portmanteau words. Maybe \"mimsy\" travelers or \"galumphing\" ships. Also, internal rhymes and wordplay will add to the effect. \n\nNeed to ensure the poem flows smoothly and each stanza connects. Let me outline the stanzas: introduction of the setting, the creatures, the traveler's actions, the challenges faced, and a resolution or departure. \n\nCheck for consistency in the rhyme scheme. Each stanza should follow AABB. Let me test a stanza:\n\n\"He chortled at the mome rays,\nAs burblebeasts danced in bays,\"\n\n\"AABB\" works here. Now, make sure the made-up words aren't too obscure but still give a vivid image. The traveler's tools, like a \"vorpal blade\" in Jabberwocky, could be something like \"a ticking charm\" to navigate time. \n\nFinally, end with the traveler moving on, emphasizing the layover as a temporary stop. Maybe leave the reader with a sense of mystery, typical of Carroll's style. \n\nLet me piece it all together, ensuring the meter and rhymes are consistent, and the whimsical elements are present throughout.

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about a conference room in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" Let me start by recalling what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It's got made-up words, playful language, and a whimsical yet adventurous tone. The original has a lot of nonsense verse that still conveys vivid imagery and emotion.\n\nSo, the challenge here is to take the mundane setting of a conference room and infuse it with that same fantastical, absurd style. First, I need to brainstorm some invented terms that relate to office environments. Maybe things like \"Flargleverse\" or \"Quizzleplacks\" could represent elements of meetings or conference technology.\n\nI should think about the structure of \"Jabberwocky.\" It has stanzas with a consistent rhyme scheme, often AABB. The poem also tells a story with a narrative arc. Applying that here, the conference room poem could have a hero (maybe a meeting leader) facing challenges like malfunctioning tech or unproductive discussions.\n\nNext, I need to incorporate some of the original's linguistic tricks, like verbs ending in -ing or -led, and combining parts of words. Words like \"jabber\" and \"chortle\" come to mind. Maybe terms like \"Flermjamming\" or \"Zinglethorn\" can describe the act of speaking in meetings or the confusion that arises.\n\nI should also ensure the poem has a clear beginning, middle, and end. Starting with the hero entering the conference room, facing the \"beasts\" (like the \"Bandersnatch\" but here maybe the \"Snicker-Snack of deadlines\"), and then overcoming the challenges. Including a triumph at the end would mirror the original's structure.\n\nRhyming is crucial here. Each stanza should follow the AABB pattern. Let me draft a few lines to test the rhythm and rhyme. For example:\n\n\"Beware the Frabjulon firmware upgrade,\nThe claws that catch, theodes that raid—\nBeware the Flargleverse and shun\nThe Quizzleplacks that munch the dawn.\"\n\nThis uses invented words and maintains the rhyme scheme. Now, applying this to conference elements: whiteboards, projectors, coffee machines, etc. Maybe the \"Mome WRTs\" (Wireless Router Things) that fail to connect, or \"Burble-wocks\" representing empty jargon.\n\nI also need a title that's catchy and fits the style. \"The Jarglewock of Meeting's Bane\" plays off \"Jabberwocky\" and introduces a central antagonist for the conference room setting.\n\nNow, assembling the stanzas step by step, ensuring each part relates to the conference room experience, with the made-up words enhancing the imagery without losing the essence of the scene. Testing the flow and making sure the absurdity remains charming rather than confusing.\n\nFinally, checking that the poem stays true to the original's spirit while effectively capturing the conference room's chaos and the hero's journey through a successful meeting.

{"i": 45, "prompt": "Write a poem about creep in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about \"creep\" in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky.\" Let me start by recalling what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. Carroll uses invented words, playful language, and a rhythmic structure with a consistent meter, often iambic tetrameter. The poem also has a narrative, usually a quest or battle, filled with whimsical creatures and nonsense verse that still conveys meaning through sound and rhythm.\n\nFirst, the title. \"Jabberwocky\" itself is a nonsense word, so maybe I should create a similar-sounding title related to \"creep.\" Words like \"slithy,\" \"mome,\" \"galumphing\" come to mind. Let me think... \"Creepwuzzy\" could work, blending \"creep\" with a whimsical suffix, similar to \"Jabberwocky.\" So, the title could be \"The Creepwuzzy.\" \n\nNext, the structure. The original has four-line stanzas with an AABB rhyme scheme. Each line is about eight syllables. I need to maintain that rhythm. The first stanza of \"Jabberwocky\" sets the scene with \"twilight\" and introduces the fantastical elements. For \"The Creepwuzzy,\" I should start with a similar setting, maybe \"m lawmakers\" (a made-up phrase) to mimic the original's \"mome raths.\" \n\nNow, the creature itself: the creep. I need to embody the characteristics of a creep through nonsensical words. In \"Jabberwocky,\" the Jabberwock has \"jaws that bite, claws that catch.\" For the creep, perhaps something like \"frazzled fringe,\" \"wamblethrops\" (a play on \"whiffling\"), and \"squelchούς η 日\" mixing languages for that Carrollian feel. Maybe they leave \"snicklesnores\" (tracks or traces) that are hard to detect.\n\nThe narrative should involve a confrontation, like the battle in \"Jabberwocky.\" The protagonist might outwit the creep. Using verbs like \"vrome\" (a blend of \"vroom\" and \"roam\") and \"jinklewiff\" to create action. Including a vorpal blade reference could be a nice homage, perhaps \"Vorpal Vibes\" as a weapon that disturbs the creature.\n\nI should also include made-up words that hint at the creep's nature: \"mimsy maws\" (weak jaws), \"floopenloops\" (maybe confusing speech or actions), \"flazzlepox\" (a condition the creep might inflict). The creep's movement could be \"galumphing,\" a direct nod to Carroll's term.\n\nThe ending should mirror the victory in \"Jabberwocky,\" but maybe with a twist. Instead of slaying the beast, perhaps the protagonist uses wit or cleverness to escape. Emphasize the lingering presence of the creep, how it haunts the \"tulgey voids\" (a nonsense place) and is feared by \"mome lawmakers,\" adding a layer of societal disregard, which fits the theme of a creep being overlooked or underestimated.\n\nNeed to check the meter. Each line should have eight syllables. Let's test a line: \"Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\" (8 syllables). For my poem, \"Beware the Creep, and shun the frumious fray\" – maybe \"Beware the Creep, and shun the frumious bandersnatch\" to match. Wait, the user wants the poem to focus on creep, so perhaps less direct references to bandersnatch. Let me adjust.\n\nInventing words: \"wumblethwacks,\" \"quokkawumps\" (a mix of quokka andumps?), \"floam\" (foam + loam?), \"blattentweed\" (blatant + weed). The goal is to create a sense of the creature's slimy, sneaky nature through these words.\n\nPutting it all together, ensuring each stanza flows with the AABB rhyme and consistent meter. The poem should have a playful yet cautionary tone, warning about the creep while maintaining the whimsical style of Carroll. Need to avoid being too on-the-nose; the description should be vivid but abstract, letting the nonsense words carry the imagery.\n\nLet me draft the stanzas step by step, checking rhythm and wordplay. Start with the warning, introduce the creature's features, the encounter, the method of overcoming it, and the aftermath. Make sure to include alliteration and assonance where Carroll would. Once drafted, read aloud to ensure the flow matches \"Jabberwocky.\"\n</think>\n\n**The Creepwuzzy**  \n\nBeware the Creep, and shun the frumious bandersnatch—  \nThe m lawmakers dab at froth with twiddlethwacks.  \nBeware the Wumplush stalk and quokkawump’s soft snare,  \nWhere tulgey voids breeds mimsy maws in flazzlepox’d air.  \n\nHe took the Vorpal Vibes (a relic floopenloop’d)  \nAnd burbled through the blight where creepwuzzies drood.  \nLong ’twas the burb, and flum the pazlumps danced in hoops,  \nAs they tithed their whimwhams, “Beware the Creepwuzzy’s cruise!”  \n\nA frumious beast!

{"i": 46, "prompt": "Compose a poem on desire path in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about a \"desire path\" in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a desire path is. From what I know, it's a trail created by people walking where there's no official path, showing the natural flow of human movement. So the poem should reflect that organic, winding journey.\n\nNow, the style of \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll is crucial here. That poem is famous for its neologisms, playful language, and whimsical yet rhythmic structure. I'll need to invent some nonsense words and maintain a consistent meter, probably iambic tetrameter.\n\nStarting with the title. \"Desire Path\" is straightforward, but Carroll often uses alliteration and invented terms. Maybe something like \"Th' Wimmly Wamble's Winding Way\" to capture the whimsy and the idea of a meandering path.\n\nNext, the opening lines. \"Jabberwocky\" begins with a setting that's both vivid and fantastical. I should establish a scene where the path exists, perhaps in a whimsical landscape. Words like \"tulgey\" or \"borogoves\" from the original can inspire similar creations here, like \"flumplenooks\" or \"jinkle-placks.\"\n\nThe poem needs to describe the path's emergence despite obstacles. Using Carroll's technique of blending real and nonsense words can help. For example, \"mome\" means a foolish person, so maybe \"mome rails\" to depict ineffective barriers.\n\nIncluding a narrative element, like a traveler choosing the path, adds depth. The traveler's defiance against straight roads can mirror the theme of desire paths overcoming rigid structures. The contrast between \"frumious\" straight roads and the winding path emphasizes the desire path's nature.\n\nThe middle stanza should highlight the path's persistence. Using verbs like \"frabjul\" and \"gallivant\" creates action and movement. Mentioning \"whiffling will\" gives the path a life of its own, making it an active character in the poem.\n\nIntroducing creatures or challenges along the path, like \"Burbling Bandersnatch\" or \"mimsy maulverines,\" adds the fantastical obstacles found in \"Jabberwocky.\" The traveler's interaction with these challenges shows determination.\n\nThe climax could involve the path leading to a discovery or transformation. Phrases like \"splendiferous sight\" and \"glorified the grimptraps\" suggest a positive outcome from following the desire path.\n\nEnding with a reflection on the path's legacy, using terms like \"outgrib\" and \"grappledYD\" to signify enduring impact, wraps the poem with a sense of timeless relevance.\n\nI need to ensure the rhythm matches \"Jabberwocky,\" which uses a strong, consistent beat. Checking each line's syllable count and stress patterns to maintain the meter. Invented words should flow naturally within the verse, enhancing rather than obstructing the meaning.\n\nFinally, review the poem for coherence and adherence to the original style. Each stanza should build on the metaphor of the desire path, blending nonsense elements with the core theme of organic, determined movement overcoming artificial constraints.\n</think>\n\n**Th' Wimmly Wamble's Winding Way**  \n\n'Twas brillig, and the mome rails  \nDid gyre and gringe in sun;  \nAll flumplenooks the moor did flail,  \nAnd mimsy maulverines were run.  \n\n\"Beware th' Wimmly Wamble, my son!  \nTh' frumious path that frays  \nTh' straight-choked roads where burbling Bandersnatch  \nGallivants in disarray!\"  \n\nHe chortled in his suxxy boots—  \n\"No quake!

{"i": 47, "prompt": "Create a poem about morning fog in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about morning fog in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" Let me recall what \"Jabberwocky\" is like. Carroll uses made-up words, playful language, and a rhythmic structure. The key elements are nonsense verse, alliteration, and whimsical imagery.\n\nSo, morning fog... I need to capture that ethereal, mysterious feel. Use neologisms that sound like real words but aren't. Maybe start with a setting, like a meadow or forest. Incorporate creatures or elements that interact with the fog.\n\nThe title should be catchy and Carroll-esque. \"The Fog That Flew\" or \"Morn's Misty Mizzle.\" Hmm, \"Mizzle\" is a term for a mix of mist and drizzle, which fits. \"The Mizzle's Frumious Play\" – \"frumious\" is from the original Jabberwocky (\"frumious Bandersnatch\"). That adds authenticity.\n\nStructure-wise, use quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. Each stanza should have a strong rhythm. Now, the first stanza sets the scene. Maybe something like:\n\nAs morn's mizzle mumbled low,\nA flibulous fog arose,\nWith glammerglow and whispers wroth,\nIt wove a wamble through the oaks.\n\n\"Flibulous\" and \"glammerglow\" are invented words. \"Wamble\" means to walk unsteadily. The fog is moving through trees.\n\nNext, introduce creatures. In Jabberwocky, there are beasts like the Bandersnatch. Maybe \"snicker-snacks\" or \"slivish toves.\" Here, the fog interacts with them:\n\nThe slivish toves in bracken quailed,\nAs vapory tendrils snickered by,\nTheir flummock tails in scuttle frail,\nDanced to the mizzle's lickerly sigh.\n\n\"Slivish toves\" are from the original. \"Flummock\" and \"lickerly\" are new. The fog's tendrils are moving, causing the creatures to react.\n\nThird stanza: the fog's effect on the environment. Maybe personify the fog as a playful entity:\n\nWith griffin claws of glimmermist,\nIt snatched the sun's rentsplendif gold,\nAnd left the moor in zephyry wrist,\nWhere fulgur blooms young dawn hath sown, yet told.\n\n\"Rentsplendif\" combines \"resplendent\" and \"splendiferous.\" \"Fulgur\" relates to lightning, here maybe glowing blooms. The fog interacts with light.\n\nFourth stanza: the fog departs, leaving mystery. The aftermath:\n\nNow mizzle's gone, the morn's agleam,\nYet in the grass, a glimmer stays—\nA frumious thread of silv'ry dream,\nWhere mizzle danced, and frabbered rays.\n\n\"Frabbered\" from \"frabjous\" in the original. The fog's remnants linger.\n\nCheck for consistent meter and rhyme. Each stanza's rhythm should match, with iambs and trochees. Ensure made-up words fit the mouthfeel of Carroll's language. Avoid clichés, keep imagery fresh. Does this capture the essence of morning fog in a whimsical, Jabberwocky style? Yes, with fantastical creatures, playful language, and the fog's personified actions. Title references \"frumious\" to tie back to the original poem.

Let me start by recalling what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. Carroll uses nonsense words that sound real, blending them with vivid imagery and playful language. The structure is consistent, with each stanza having a similar rhythm and rhyme scheme.\n\nFirst, I need to capture the essence of the third rail. The third rail is part of electric railway systems, so I should incorporate elements related to trains, electricity, and maybe some industrial or mystical atmosphere. Words like \"hum\", \"current\", \"track\", \"locomotive\" come to mind. I should invent some Carroll-esque terms, maybe \"snickel bourgeoisie\" or \"frumious beam\". \n\nThe poem should have a narrative, like a journey or a quest, similar to \"Jabberwocky\".

{"i": 49, "prompt": "Compose a poem on film camera in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about a film camera in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" Let me start by recalling the original poem's characteristics. \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll is known for its whimsical language, invented words, playful rhythm, and nonsense verses that still convey vivid imagery.\n\nFirst, I need to capture the essence of a film camera. Key elements include the shutter, film roll, developing process, and the nostalgic feel. Now, how to blend these with Carroll's style. \n\nI should invent some portmanteau words. For example, \"whirlibirds\" could mimic the whirring of the shutter. \"Snicker-Snack\" from the original might become \"Shutter's Snicker-Snap\" to tie in the camera's mechanism. \n\nThe structure is important. \"Jabberwocky\" has a consistent meter and rhyme scheme, usually ABAB. I'll need to maintain that. Let me outline the stanzas: introduction of the camera, loading the film, taking a photo, developing, and the result. \n\nFor the title, \"The Frumious Film Camera\" incorporates \"frumious,\" a blend of \"fuming\" and \"furious\" from the original, tying in the camera's function. \n\nNow, drafting each stanza with made-up words but keeping the camera theme. Testing the rhythm to ensure it matches the galloping iambic tetrameter. Words like \"vulptuous vipers\" could represent subjects being photographed, and \"glorpalities\" might evoke the development process. \n\nNeed to ensure each verse flows smoothly and the nonsense words still hint at their meanings. For example, \"galloped\" for the film advancing, \"soda-crack\" referencing chemical development. Ending with the joy of the developed photo, \"foamy maw\" suggesting the revealed image. \n\nCheck for consistency in rhyme and meter. Make adjustments where lines feel forced. Once satisfied, put it all together with the title. Let me review the example response to ensure alignment with these elements. Seems to capture the whimsy and technical aspects of the camera through invented language, maintaining the requested style.\n</think>\n\n**The Frumious Film Camera**  \n\nBeware the Shutter’s frumious eye, my son,  \nThe ivory craft that whirrs, then clicks, then’s done—  \nLongtime the glassy lens it shines so sweet,  \nBut guard thy pose, nor thou the focus beat.  \n\nBeware the Snapp’roach, mop and mow so sly,  \nThe Vorpal Tripod’s burbles, twiddlewry—  \nHe took the Filmroll in his vulturish hand;  \n“Now, quother me,” the shutter snapped the land.  \n\n‘Twas brillig, and the slithy subjects did gyre,  \nVulptuous vipers vamped in silk attire;  \nAll misbegot, the mome raths did stride,  \nAs Dad didst cock the snapsmith, side by side.  \n\n“Beware the Shutter’s snicker-SNACK, my boy,  \nThe jaws that bite, the claws that coruscate joy—  \nIt froths and fribbles, furrowed with fruitless zeal,  \nBut drop the film in soda-crack, and REVEAL!”  \n\nHe leapèd on the space where light didst play,  \nThe whumping mirror rose—“Oh, there’s my frabjulay!”  \nA glimble glorp of chemicals, a tub of thrumous stew,  \nTill Mom didst gasp, “The negatives photo-brew!”  \n\n’Twas mimsy no more; the images didst gleam—  \nA jubjub bird, a bandersnatch in a dream.  \n“Let’s rotoscrawl this frumious, whiffling maw,”  \nThe Snicker-Snack shot forth, and all bestrode—awe-straw!  \n\nSo if thy shutter urges thee to shoot,  \nLet Mom unclay the glims, and Dad unstop the loot—  \nFor every frumious camera, fierce yet mild,  \nIn glorpalities, shall froth thy foamy maw, beguiled.", "info": {"topic": "film camera"}, "reward": 0.5555555555555556, "label": "medium", "criteria_yes": 10, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.5555555555555556, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 0.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "model_id": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "model_slug": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1"}
