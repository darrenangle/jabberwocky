One, two! And through and through  \nThe 50-mill’ lens went click-snack!  \nHe left its chemicals boiling where it stood,  \nAnd clattered back.  \n\n“And hast thou slain the Film-camera?  \nCome to my chamber, grandiose boy!  \nHe chortled in his silver tray—  \nHe’s found the latent joy!”  \n\n’Twas silver, and the slithy reel  \nDid gyre and gimble in the darkroom bay;  \nAll mirror-seeming were the spools,  \nAnd the selenium tones out-spray.", "info": {"topic": "film camera"}, "reward": 0.9444444444444444, "label": "high", "criteria_yes": 17, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.9444444444444444, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}}
