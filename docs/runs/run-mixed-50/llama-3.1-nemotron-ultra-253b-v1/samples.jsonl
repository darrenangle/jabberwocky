{"i": 0, "prompt": "Write a poem about underpass echo in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about underpass echo in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Let me start by recalling what makes 'Jabberwocky' unique. It's got that playful use of nonsense words, a rhythmic meter, and vivid, whimsical imagery. The challenge here is to blend those elements with the theme of an underpass and echoes.\n\nFirst, I need a title that's catchy and has a Carroll-esque ring. Maybe something like \"The Burblewock's Refrain\" or \"Echoflum's Canopy\". Let me brainstorm a bit. \"The Underwych’s Echo\" sounds mysterious and fits the quirky style.\n\nNow, the structure. 'Jabberwocky' uses quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme and a bouncy iambic tetrameter. I should stick to that. Start setting the scene of the underpass. Use made-up words that evoke the environment. Words like \"flumplenax\" or \"snicker-snack\" for the original, so maybe \"grimbulge\" for the underpass structure.\n\nNext, the echo itself. Need to personify it. Maybe the echo is a creature or a force with a voice. \"Vesper-keen\" could describe the time of day or the sound's sharpness. Words like \"glibblejaws\" and \"mimusong\" to create that whimsical feel.\n\nInclude some action, like the echo interacting with the surroundings. \"Syllables...slither, scale, and sprawl\" gives movement. Maybe a refrain that repeats with variations, like the bellman's song in Carroll's work. \"O the underwych’s echo / Flum-i-lee!\" as a memorable line.\n\nCheck the meter as I go. Each line should have eight syllables with the stress on every second beat. Let me scan some lines. \"Beneath the grimbulge where the road does slide,\" – that's iambic tetrameter. Good.\n\nEnsure the nonsense words make sense in context. \"Flishy\" for something fish-like but not quite, \"squelch-weed\" for vegetation in a damp underpass. The poem should feel like a journey through this fantastical underpass, encountering the echo creature.\n\nEnd with the echo's persistence, maybe a warning or a haunting presence. \"Beware the underwych’s echo—it plots, / A murmur prosecuting your stride, / For every sound that in darkness is sown / The flum-i-lee shall your footsteps divide.\" Adds a sense of caution, fitting the 'Jabberwocky' cautionary style.\n\nFinally, review for consistency in style, rhyme, and meter. Make sure the invented words contribute to the atmosphere without being too obscure. Adjust any lines that stumble rhythmically. That should do it.\n</think>\n\n**The Underwych’s Echo**  \n\nBeneath the grimbulge where the road does slide,  \nThe vesper-keen and the gloam conspire—  \n’Tis here the flibberjaws couch, side by side,  \nAnd m状-song mingles with mickle mire.  \n\n“ Beware the glissshrike’s syruped hiss,  \nAnd shun the flumplenax’s frizzled sway—  \nBut chiefly scorn the underwych’s wish  \nTo trap thy voice in its echoey gray! ”  \n\nA glimble night—no starmaws in the vault,  \nYet squelch-weed hums where grindsnipe roots delve—  \nWhen sudden, ululation without fault  \nRang out—a burble that would not quell.  \n\n“’Tis the Echoflume, with glibblejaws agleam,  \nVexing the void with its frabjulon cheer,  \nEach syllable a spider-frail esteem  \nSlithering scale and sprawl, grating near…”  \n\nI balmed my soul with flibloom in hand,  \nStrode where the gloopernuts hang in herds,  \nBut as I stepped, the echo took command—  \nA vortex of voice, my every word blurred!  \n\n“ O the underwych’s echo / Flum-i-lee!  \nIt froths and fangs what thou speakest free,  \nReaving reason, reaving melody,  \nTill all’s a chewed and flub-a-lub sea! ”  \n\nI dashed the glimmerwisp—my watchword bright—  \nBut syllables split like froth on a fang,  \nAnd whether nonsense or no, the night  \nHissed back my dread in a warbling clang.  \n\nSo heed this flarp, ye who thread the gloam,  \nLest the underwych’s echo seize thy name—  \nFor in its burblethroats, sense goes foam,  \nAnd meaning melts like mome-moths in flame.", "info": {"topic": "underpass echo"}, "reward": 0.7777777777777778, "label": "medium", "criteria_yes": 14, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.7777777777777778, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}}

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about morning fog in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. First, I need to recall what makes 'Jabberwocky' unique. It's full of nonsense words, playful language, and a whimsical rhythm. Carroll invents words that sound real but aren't, which creates that fantastical feel.\n\nSo, the focus is on morning fog. I should start by brainstorming some fog-related imagery. Maybe personify the fog as a creature or something mysterious. Words like 'mist', 'shroud', 'silken', 'twilight' come to mind. But I need to twist them into Carroll-esque terms. Let's see... \"Frosthound\" could be a creature of the fog. \"Snicker-snack\" is a term from the original, so maybe incorporate similar sounds.\n\nNext, the structure. 'Jabberwocky' has a consistent meter, primarily trochaic tetrameter. Each line has eight syllables with a strong-weak pattern. I should maintain that rhythm. Let's outline the stanzas. Start with the setting, introduce the fog as a character, describe its movement and effect on the environment, maybe some action verbs with made-up words, and a conclusion that mirrors the opening.\n\nImagery is key. The fog doesn't just lie there; it slinks, prowls, twines around things. Use alliteration and assonance for musicality. Maybe \"slinked through the sleepy dells\" or \"prowling, it twines\". The fog could have a dual nature—both eerie and enchanting. Words like \"gilded\" and \"gauze\" add that shimmering, delicate touch.\n\nNow, inventing nonsense words. \"Frosthound\" as the fog's name. \"Mome-wracks\" for the mist's effect on the surroundings. \"Borogoves\" from the original could be referenced or replaced with something similar. \"Galumphing\" is another Carroll term; maybe \"thrum\" or \"murmurs\" to mimic that sound.\n\nPutting it all together. Start with the title, something like \"The Frosthound's Prowl\" to capture that Jabberwocky creature feel. Each stanza tells part of the fog's journey through the morning. Include a bridge where the fog interacts with the environment, maybe lifting to reveal the sun. End with a warning or a lingering presence, similar to the original's cautionary tone.\n\nCheck the rhythm line by line. Ensure the syllables fit and the stresses are in the right places. Read it aloud to catch any clunky parts. Revise as needed to maintain the flow and whimsy. Avoid being too literal; embrace the nonsense while keeping the fog theme clear.\n\nFinally, review for Jabberwocky elements: made-up words, playful language, imaginative creatures, and a rhythmic, lyrical flow. Make sure the poem feels both familiar in style and fresh in content, with the morning fog as the star of its own whimsical adventure.\n</think>\n\n**The Frosthound's Prowl**  \n\n'Twas glimp in the vespertide, where mome-wracks do play,  \nA frosthound arose, with a murmur and sway,  \nIt slinked through the sleepy dells, all silken and pale,  \nWith tendrils that clung like a gilded gauze-frail.  \n\n\"Beware the throcklepox, my son!  \nIts snicker-snack jaws crunch the sun—  \nNo vorpal blade cuts through its haze,  \nTill noon's keen eye the gloom amaze!\"  \n\nIt prowled, it twined, with a wizzle and hum,  \nThrough bracken that bristled, all froth and all fume,  \nOutgrabled the brooks, all mimsy and slow,  \nAs the frosthound's breath bit the birch-limbs to woe.  \n\nIt frabjuled the thorns, it flumplenooked the air,  \nWhere whiffling bats blinked, all blind and aware,  \nYet still, oh still, came that mome-wrack thrum,  \nA dinnous din, like a vellichor's hum.  \n\nThe foghounds congregated, a gallimaufry clan,  \nThey cruddled, they crunched, with a snicker and scan,  \nBut when the morn's maw gasped gold, they thinned to a thread,  \nUnriddled, undone, as the sun's Tongue was said.  \n\nSo tread ye, ye trauvlers, when dusk dims the dell,  \nLest the frosthound's paws give your shanks a farewell—  \nIts liftles are long, and its gloam is a thief,  \nThat glibglibglops all in the raw of relief.", "info": {"topic": "morning fog"}, "reward": 0.7222222222222222, "label": "medium", "criteria_yes": 13, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.7222222222222222, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}}

Carroll uses nonsense words, playful language, and a rhythmic, sometimes humorous tone. The structure is quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme and a consistent meter, probably iambic tetrameter.\n\nFirst, I need a title. \"Déjà Vu\" is the theme, so maybe something like \"The Déjà Vu's Dizzying Jest\" to capture that whimsical feel. Now, the opening line should set the scene, maybe \"Beware the déjà vu, my son!\" to mimic \"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!\" \n\nNext, incorporate made-up words that evoke the sensation of déjà vu. Words like \"flumplenooks\" or \"gloriasnatch\" could work. Need to describe the experience: feeling like you've been there before, a trick of the mind. Use imagery related to time loops, echoes, and confusion.\n\nInclude actions and a progression, like encountering strange creatures (maybe \"mome raths\" become \"flickerwings\" or \"shadowsprites\") and a resolution. End with a sense of the experience passing, leaving the protagonist puzzled but unharmed. Ensure each stanza follows the rhyme scheme and meter.

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about desire paths in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\". First, I need to recall what a desire path is—those informal trails people create by taking shortcuts, often seen in parks or campuses. Now, the challenge is to blend that concept with Carroll's unique style.\n\n\"Jabberwocky\" is known for its nonsense words, playful language, and whimsical rhythm. So, I need to invent some fantastical terms related to paths, walking, or nature. Maybe words like \"snicker-snack\" from the original can inspire similar creations.\n\nI should start with a title that echoes \"Jabberwocky\". Perhaps \"The Desirezook\" or \"Treadledee\". Let's go with \"Treadlemire's Twist\" to give it a mystical feel. The setting should be a curious landscape, maybe a meadow or a wood, where these desire paths come alive.\n\nNext, the structure. Carroll uses quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. I'll follow that. Each stanza should introduce a new element of the path, using made-up words. For example, \"mimsy\" could become \"mimble\" to describe the terrain. \n\nI need to incorporate the idea of people's feet creating the path. Maybe personify the path itself, giving it agency. Words like \"wanderwaltz\" or \"waywrest\" might work. Also, include some obstacles or creatures, like \"thicketwyrm\" or \"burblesnatch\", to add that Carroll-esque whimsy.\n\nThe poem should have a narrative arc: introducing the path, the journey along it, challenges faced, and the outcome. Ending with a reflection on the path's creation and its fading, emphasizing the transient nature of desire paths.\n\nNow, check for rhythm. Each line should be roughly iambic tetrameter. Read it aloud to ensure the flow matches \"Jabberwocky\". Also, ensure the made-up words are consistent and fit the meter.\n\nRevise any lines that feel forced. For instance, \"Where wanderers weave their wistful way\" might become \"Where wanderwaltz their wistful way\" to keep the alliteration and invented terms. Make sure the verbs are active and the imagery vivid.\n\nFinally, the title should be attention-grabbing and fit the theme. \"Treadlemire's Twist\" suggests a turning, tricky path, which aligns with desire paths being serpentine and spontaneous. The closing lines should leave a lingering sense of enchantment and the ephemeral nature of these trails.\n</think>\n\n**Treadlemire's Twist**  \n\n‘Twas brillig on the mimsy mead, where wanderwaltz their wistful way,  \nAloft the dusk of dwindled dells, desire paths twist, come what may.  \n\"Beware the Burblesnatch, my son, with jaws that gulf the trodden ground,  \nLest mockturtles mock thy merry march where Treadlemire’s whispers wend around!\"  \n\nHe chortled, gripping clefted stick—through thorny thickets, onward rushed,  \nWhere gilded leaves of lah-lah trees in satiny silence hushed.  \n\"Left, two-left, now shuffle right!\" the Flibberjibits shrilled with glee,  \nAs snickering stones gave way to his socks (a curious sight to see).  \n\nHe vaulted Vooner-vaults of vapour, skimmed Snicker-Snacks’ sly, serpentine,  \nAnd dodged the flumplenux fronds that wept a briny, brier-kissed wine.  \nThe Thicketwyrm in greeting grinned: \"What wilt thou here, a-questing thus?  \nThis wisp of way is wrought by want—no map shall ever map *us*!\"  \n\n\"Bah!

The original has a consistent meter and rhyme scheme, often with an ABAB pattern.\n\nSo, the first step is to mimic that structure. I need to create a title that sounds whimsical and a bit nonsensical. Maybe something like \"The Burnwick Screen\" to play off \"Jabberwocky.\"\n\nNext, I should think about the theme of screen burn-in. That's when static images remain on a screen due to prolonged display. I need to translate that into the fantastical creatures and actions found in \"Jabberwocky.\" Words like \"vortext\" instead of vortex and text, \"pixelwings\" to describe the pixels sticking. Maybe \"glowstalkers\" for the static images haunting the screen.\n\nI need to maintain the rhythm, probably iambic tetrameter, with four beats per line. The rhyme scheme should be alternating, so each pair of lines rhymes. Carroll uses a lot of alliteration and portmanteau words, so I should create similar compounds. For example, \"flickerflame\" or \"glitchgloom.\"\n\nThe narrative should have a hero's journey, battling the burn-in. Start with a warning, then the encounter with the creatures, the struggle, and victory. Maybe end with a warning about the burn-in's recurrence.\n\nLet me draft some lines. \"Beware the Burnwick Screen, my son!\" mirrors the opening of \"Jabberwocky.\" Then describe the environment, like the \"visual vale\" and \"glowstalkers\" creeping. Include some action verbs like \"galumphing\" and \"whiffling,\" which are from the original poem.\n\nI need to ensure the technical terms related to screens are blended with fantastical language. Words like \"backlight beast,\" \"subpixel specters,\" \"LED Licker\" could work. Also, include the idea of the screen dimming and the burn-in setting in.\n\nFinally, wrap it up with a warning that even after defeating it, the burn-in might return if not careful.

Let me start by recalling what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It uses nonsense words that sound meaningful, a playful rhythm, and vivid, whimsical imagery. So I need to capture that essence while incorporating elements of Monte Carlo, which is known for luxury, casinos, and the Monaco Grand Prix.\n\nFirst, the title should have that whimsical touch. Maybe something like \"Monte Carlo Myrabble\"? \"Myrabble\" sounds like a Carroll-esque made-up word. Next, the structure: \"Jabberwocky\" has four-line stanzas with an ABAB rhyme scheme and a consistent meter, probably iambic tetrameter. I'll need to stick to that.\n\nNow, elements of Monte Carlo to include: casinos, roulette wheels, luxury cars, the sea, maybe the gambling aspect. But how to blend these with fantastical creatures and actions? Let's see. Instead of a Jabberwock, maybe a creature like the \"Slivovitz\" or \"Baccarat Bandersnatch\". Use terms from gambling in a fantastical way.\n\nFor example, \"Beware the Baccarat Bandersnatch\" plays off \"Beware the Jabberwock\". Then, setting scenes with terms like \"tippet\" (from the original poem) could be transformed into something related to the setting, like \"moonlit quay\" near the sea. \n\nIncorporate sounds and actions: clinking chips, spinning wheels, the hum of engines (for the Grand Prix). Maybe a stanza about a race with \"otyugh\" sounds and \"frumious\" speed. \n\nNeed to maintain the rhythm.

Maybe a resolution where they outsmart the casino's dangers.\n\nCheck the rhymes and meter. Each line should have eight syllables, iambic tetrameter. Also, ensure the portmanteau words blend gambling and fantasy.

Maybe terms like \"wings,\" \"stage,\" \"curtain,\" \"props,\" \"backstage,\" \"footlights,\" \"spotlight,\" \"script,\" \"characters,\" \"set.\" Now, I should invent some whimsical words blending these concepts. For example, \"Wingwhif\" for the wings themselves, \"Flibloom\" for the curtain movements, \"Snickergrin\" for the stagehands' expressions.\n\nNext, think about the structure. Each stanza should have four lines with alternating rhymes. The original poem has a narrative flow, so maybe start with setting the scene in the theater, introduce the wings as alive, describe their movement, their role in the play, and conclude with their importance.\n\nCheck for alliteration and playful sounds. Use words that evoke movement and mystery, like \"shimmershade,\" \"glimmerwrought.\" Include some actions: \"twirl,\" \"swirl,\" \"beckon,\" \"whisper.\" Maybe add some creatures or metaphors, like \"Shadeborn\" for shadows, \"Glimmerwings\" for the sparkles.\n\nEnsure each stanza builds the imagery. Start with the wings' presence, then their interaction with performers, their hidden aspects backstage, and their magical contribution to the play. Use made-up verbs like \"frabjulon\" (from the original) as \"twirl\" or \"beckon.\"\n\nTest the rhyme scheme. Each stanza should follow ABAB. Read each line aloud to check the rhythm and flow, making sure it matches the original's cadence. Avoid forced rhymes; let the invented words carry the verse smoothly.\n\nNow, draft the title, maybe something like \"Wingwhif’s Loom\" to incorporate the invented word and suggest the weaving of the stage magic. Then piece together each stanza with the elements discussed.

Avoid being too obscure; the poem should still convey the process and joy of cooking with brown butter.\n\nAlright, time to put it all together, keeping the language lively and the structure true to \"Jabberwocky.\" Let the poem cook like the brown butter itself, blending whimsy with culinary delight.\n</think>\n\n**The Frumious Fritter**  \n\nBeware the Brown Butterwick, my son!  \nThe sizzle that fries with the twirly spoon,  \nBeware the Fizzleth and the Froth that’s spun—  \nBy the pot where the cream doth croon!  \n\nHe took the churn-owl’s golden glare,  \nAnd stirred with a spatula’s flick—  \nLong time the milk-maids raved to share  \nThe froth of the butter’s frantic kick!  \n\nOh, twirl the spatula of might,  \nThrough the whey’s wild waltz of doom,  \nThough the Sizzlewack may bite and spite,  \nBeware the Buttergremlin’s gloom!  \n\nAnd, lo!

{"i": 12, "prompt": "Write a poem about creep in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about \"creep\" in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\". Let me start by recalling what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It uses nonsense words that sound meaningful, playful language, and a rhythmic structure. The original has a consistent meter and made-up terms like \"slithy\" and \"galumphing\".\n\nFirst, I need a title that echoes \"Jabberwocky\" but incorporates \"creep\". Maybe \"The Creep\" or \"Jabbercreep\"? \"Jabbercreep\" sounds more Carroll-esque. Now, the poem should have a narrative, perhaps a warning about a mysterious creature called the Creep.\n\nI should create portmanteau words. For example, \"slithy\" is a mix of \"slimy\" and \"lithe\". Let me brainstorm some terms related to creeping. \"Slink\" and \"slinkly\"? \"Snicker\" and \"snickered\"? Maybe \"jinkle\" for a sound that's jittery. \"Flish\" for a fish-like movement. \"Wuggle\" for struggling. \"Flishing\" could describe the Creep's movement.\n\nThe structure of \"Jabberwocky\" has four-line stanzas with an ABAB rhyme scheme. I need to maintain that. Let me outline the stanzas. Start with a warning, then describe the creature's appearance, its actions, the confrontation, and the aftermath.\n\nFirst stanza: Set the scene, perhaps at dusk with a warning. \"Beware the Creep, my son!\" mirrors \"Beware the Jabberwock\". Include some nonsense verbs like \"jinkles\" and \"wrym\". Next, describe the creature's features using made-up words. \"Eyes agleam with glim\" – \"glim\" as a shimmering light. \"Flishing\" through the air.\n\nThen, the action: it moves stealthily, sneaking and snickering. Maybe it steals something, like \"mome\" (a nonsense word from Carroll) socks or a \"jubjub's\" tail. The protagonist confronts it with a vorpal blade. The battle is brief, and the Creep vanishes, leaving behind a \"burble\" sound.\n\nFinally, the resolution: the land is safe, and the moral is to beware the Creep. Check the meter. Each line should be roughly iambic tetrameter. Read through and adjust syllables where needed. Ensure the rhymes are consistent and the made-up words fit the rhythm. Add some alliteration and playful language throughout. Let me piece it together now, stanza by stanza, keeping the Carroll vibe with whimsical words and a cautionary tale.\n</think>\n\n**Jabbercreep**  \n\nBeware the Creep, my son!  \nThe jinkles wrym, the snath’s undone—  \nBy dusk’s outgrabe, he’s never still,  \nAnd burbles on with glee distilled.  \n\nHis eyes agleam with glim did stare,  \nFlishing through air with frumious care;  \nHe snicks the mome socks from your drawer,  \nAnd snarks the tail from a jubjub’s roar.  \n\n“Beware the Creep!” the borogoves cry,  \nAs he wuggles by with a winkled sigh;  \nHe’ll frab the jam from yesterday’s tart,  \nAnd mimsy yourthreat to a has-been heart.  \n\nI sought him armed with vorpal spoon,  \nThrough tulgey woods where shadows croon.  \nHe snickered low, a frumious hiss,  \nTill I stuck the blade in his glibblen wish.  \n\nYet still he creeped, though shrunk to half—  \nA slink of borr, a fume, a laugh.  \nThe dawn arose, and he wizzle flew,  \nLeaving but ripples in glimmerglow dew.  \n\nSo heed this tale, ye mome and ye grill,  \nThe Creep’s best slain with a frabby will.  \nFor though he’s wroth but a whim-wham wight,  \nHe’ll mimsy your socks through the endless night.", "info": {"topic": "creep"}, "reward": 0.8333333333333334, "label": "high", "criteria_yes": 15, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.8333333333333334, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}}
{"i": 13, "prompt": "Compose a poem on awl in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, user wants a poem in the style of \"Jabberwocky\" about an awl. Let me start by recalling what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It's got made-up words that sound real, a playful language, and a nonsense verse structure with a rhythmic pattern. The original poem by Carroll has a distinctive rhythm and rhyme scheme, often ABAB quatrains with anapestic tetrameter.\n\nFirst, the title should reflect a mix of the mundane object (awl) with that whimsical, fantastical touch. Maybe something like \"The Frumious Awl\"? \"Frumious\" is a blend of \"fuming\" and \"furious,\" a portmanteau from the original poem. That could work.\n\nNow, the content. Need to create creatures and actions around the awl. The awl is a pointed tool, so maybe it's a weapon against some fanciful beasts. Let's think of some nonsense creatures. \"Snicker-snacks\" could be a reference, maybe \"bandersnatch\" but modified. \"Glintzenwings\" might be something shiny and winged. \"Mome\" is from the original, so \"momewraiths\" could be a spooky figure.\n\nThe poem should have a heroic narrative, with the protagonist using the awl to battle these creatures. Each stanza needs that rhythm. Let's check the syllables. Anapestic tetrameter is eight syllables with four beats per line, unstressed-stressed-unstressed, etc. Let me draft a first stanza:\n\n\"O, frumious awl, with blade aflame,\nIn Momewoods where the glintzenwings play,\nBeware the snicker-snacks that maul thy frame,\nAnd skewer them 'fore the dusk of day.\"\n\n\"Maul\" might not be the best word. Maybe \"Beware the snicker-snacks that gnaw thy frame,\" to keep the rhythm. \"Dusk of day\" needs to rhyme with \"play,\" so maybe \"slay the frumious fiends of day.\" Wait, original has \"and chortled in joy\" for the last line. Let me tweak the rhyme scheme.\n\nNext stanza could introduce the action of using the awl. \"So grasp it tight and charge thee well, / Through tulgey thickets, thorny, dark, and deep,\" \"Tulgey\" is from the original poem. Then perhaps a battle scene with galumphing beasts.\n\nThird stanza: \"When burbly pooks with eyes aglow, / Palliwarts in the mead\"] Hmm, maybe \"palliwarts\" are another creature. Need to maintain the nonsense feel.\n\nFinally, a triumphant ending where the awl defeats the monsters. \"And as the moon ascends the peak, / The frumious awl, now still and meek,\" giving it a peaceful conclusion after the battle.\n\nCheck the rhythm of each line. Let's read them aloud. Adjust words where the meter falters. For example, \"Beware the snicker-snacks that gnaw thy frame,\" might be better than \"maul.\" Ensure the anapestic flow.\n\nAlso, include portmanteau words and alliteration. \"Glintzenwings\" mixes glitter and wings. \"Mome\" from the original. \"Palliwarts\" could be a mix of pallid and warts. \"Gallimaufry\" is a real word but obscure, fitting the style.\n\nAlright, putting it all together with the title and stanzas. Make sure each stanza has four lines with the ABAB rhyme scheme. Consistency in structure is key to mimicking \"Jabberwocky\" effectively.\n</think>\n\n**The Frumious Awl**  \n\nO, frumious awl, with blade aflame,  \nIn Momewoods where the glintzenwings play,  \nBeware the snicker-snacks that gnaw thy frame,  \nAnd slay the frumious fiends of day.  \n\nSo seize it firm, with grip of old,  \nThrough tulgey thickets—thorny, dark, and deep—  \nAnd charge thee forth to battle’s hold,  \nWhere palliwarts in gallimaufry creep.  \n\nWhen burbly pooks with eyes aglow  \nGalumph through ferns with stings to sting,  \nHalt not, nor shrink thy thrust to slow—  \nAim true, where gleebeasts’ grubble-wings cling!  \n\nYet should the mawlepox with vapory might  \nEclipse the moon in doleful fog,  \nPlunge in—thy frumious fray’s in sight—  \nAnd stout awl-shafts make monsters cog.  \n\nAnd when the dawn’s brillig beams unfold,  \nAnd frondy frabjulice doth chortle free,  \nThy frumious awl, now quiet, cold,  \nHath conquered mome and jabbered glee.", "info": {"topic": "awl"}, "reward": 0.7777777777777778, "label": "medium", "criteria_yes": 14, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.7777777777777778, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}}

It's a nonsense poem by Lewis Carroll with made-up words that sound meaningful, a rhythmic flow, and a whimsical, slightly dark adventure theme.\n\nFirst, I need to capture the essence of the third rail. The third rail is part of electric railway systems, it's dangerous, high voltage, and has that distinctive hum. The challenge is to blend that modern, industrial element with Carroll's whimsical, archaic language.\n\nThe title should be catchy and reminiscent of \"Jabberwocky.\" Maybe something like \"The Frumious Hum of the Third Rail's Sway\" to keep the alliteration and nonsense words.\n\nNow, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. I need to maintain that. Each stanza should introduce some mystical creature or action, but related to the railway. For example, instead of a Jabberwock, maybe a \"voltwisp\" or \"sparksprites.\"\n\nI should incorporate the danger and the hum. Words like \"glimmerwings,\" \"current's sigh,\" \"zephyrs\" for the wind. Use alliteration and hyphenated compounds like Carroll did, such as \"frumious,\" which combines \"fuming\" and \"furious.\"\n\nInclude actions: \"eware the third rail's thrum of might,\" \"him who dares the live rail's lair.\" Maybe a narrative of someone approaching the third rail, facing dangers, and escaping.\n\nEnd with a warning and a sense of overcoming the danger. \"He chortled at the frumious hum / And the rails' long frabjous day.\" Frabjous is a Carroll term, mixing \"fabulous\" and \"fearsome.\"\n\nCheck the rhythm, each line should be roughly iambic tetrameter. Read it aloud to ensure the flow matches. Make sure the made-up words are consistent with the style and the railway theme.\n\nAvoid being too literal. Keep the mystical vibe while hinting at the modern elements. Maybe \"metro*******\" for subway or train.

Let me start by recalling that \"Jabberwocky\" is known for its nonsense words, playful language, and a rhythmic structure. The challenge here is to capture that whimsical feel while incorporating science elements.\n\nFirst, the title. \"Jabberwocky\" has a whimsical, made-up title. Maybe something like \"The Science Whimsy\" or \"Labberwocky\"? \"Labberwocky\" sounds like a good blend of \"lab\" and \"Jabberwocky\", maintaining the rhyme and meter.\n\nNow, the structure. The original poem has four-line stanzas with an ABCB rhyme scheme. I'll need to follow that. Let's brainstorm some science fair elements: volcanoes, robots, baking soda, slime, judges, experiments going wrong, etc.\n\nIncorporate nonsense words. For example, \"gallimaufry\" could represent a mix of experiments. \"Quarkle\" might be a play on quarks. \"Zorbles\" could be bubbles or something fizzing. \"Groink\" as a funny sound from a volcano.\n\nStart with a warning, like the original's \"Beware the Jabberwocky.\" Maybe \"Beware the Science Fair, my son!\" Then describe the setting: gymnasium, tables with projects. Introduce fantastical elements: \"gallimaufry of slime and dreams,\" \"quarkle spoons.\"\n\nNext stanza: a robot with a \"frumious band,\" \"joints of wire, eyes of LED.\" Maybe it dances or falls apart. Then the volcano with \"frothy fright\" and \"Bubble, bubble, toil, and groink.\"\n\nInclude interactions with judges, using terms like \"burble\" and \"flair.\" Maybe a project that \"splodes\" with a \"whiffling boom.\" Conclude with a lesson learned and a return home, tying back to the beginning.\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme and meter.

So, I need to invent some whimsical terms related to printers and paper jams.\n\nFirst, I'll brainstorm some printer-related terms and twist them into fantastical words. Words like \"glitch,\" \"jam,\" \"paper,\" \"ink,\" \"toner,\" \"machine\" can be transformed. Maybe \"Tonerwack\" for the printer itself, \"glitchmire\" for the jam. The setting should be a fantastical place, like a \"burrow of Beelzebub's bailiwick\" to add that dark, playful atmosphere.\n\nNext, think about the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has a consistent meter and rhyme scheme, usually AABB. Each stanza is four lines, with a trochaic tetrameter. So, I need to maintain that rhythm. Let me draft the first stanza, introducing the protagonist approaching the problematic printer.\n\nThen, the action of the jam: the paper twists, the machine gnashes gears. Maybe include a battle with the jam, using whimsical verbs. The resolution would involve freeing the paper, perhaps with a \"vorpal blade\" reference, like using scissors or a tool.\n\nInclude some alliteration and playful phrases, like \"frumious fray\" or \"gallimaufry of gears.\" Make sure each stanza flows into the next, escalating the problem and then resolving it. End with a sense of triumph but caution, as in the original's warning about the Jabberwock.\n\nCheck for consistent meter and invented words that fit the nonsense style.

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about an umbrella in the style of \"Jabberwocky\". Let me recall what that style is like. \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll uses made-up words, playful language, and a whimsical, nonsensical feel. The rhythm is important, with a consistent meter and rhyme scheme. So I need to invent some fantastical words related to umbrellas.\n\nFirst, the title. \"Jabberwocky\" has a title that's one word, maybe a nonsense word. Maybe \"Brollumbry\" combining \"brolly\" (a slang term for umbrella) and \"umbry\" to sound more Carroll-esque.\n\nNow, the structure. Each stanza has a certain number of lines, maybe quatrains with alternating rhymes. Let's see the original: eight lines with ABAB rhyme scheme. Wait, \"Jabberwocky\" actually has four-line stanzas with ABAB rhyme, but some stanzas are shorter. Let me check. The first stanza is eight lines, but others vary. Maybe I can use four-line stanzas with a similar rhythm.\n\nNext, the content. The poem should tell a story with whimsical creatures and actions. Umbrellas can be personified. Maybe they dance or fight against the rain. Use alliteration and portmanteau words. Words like \"gallimaufry\" or \"frumious\" from the original. For umbrella, terms like \"snicker-snack\" maybe \"twiggle\" or \"glibble\".\n\nImagery related to weather, rain, wind. Maybe the umbrella is a hero battling the \"slithy toves\" of rain. The protagonist wields the umbrella like a vorpal sword. Include made-up verbs and nouns. Think of parts of an umbrella: ribs, handle, canopy. Give them fantastical names: \"jubjub ribs\", \"manxomehandle\", \"tulgey canopy\".\n\nNeed to maintain the rhythm, which is primarily in iambic tetrameter. Each line has eight syllables, unstressed-stressed pattern. Let me test some lines.\n\n\"Beware the Brollumbry, my son!  \nThe jaws that bite, the limbs that slap—  \nBeware the Frumious Flish that run  \nWhen Whiffling winds begin to yap.\"\n\nHmm, \"Brollumbry\" as the monster? Or maybe the umbrella itself is the Brollumbry. Let the narrative involve a battle against the rain forces. The protagonist takes the umbrella and fights, using it to defeat the rain creatures.\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme. ABAB for each stanza. Let's draft a few stanzas.\n\nMaybe:\n\nHe took the Brollumbry in hand,  \nWith Glibblejaws and Flish aflur—  \nA Tulgey shield of soggysaund,  \nHe strode into the Splinkter’s blur.\n\nThen clash’d the Rumbustious rain,  \nWith Jabberjaws in snarling flocks—  \nBut oh, that frabjul grip so vain!  \nThe Blattentwacks recoiled in shocks.\n\nWait, \"Rumbustious\" combines \"robust\" and \"rumble\"? Maybe. \"Blattentwacks\" could be a term for the wind gusts. \"Frabjul\" from \"frabjous\" in the original.\n\nContinue with the battle scene. The umbrella's canopy serves as a shield. The ribs might be made of something fantastical. Maybe in the end, the umbrella prevails, and the sun comes out.\n\nSo, putting it all together with a title and stanzas, ensuring the rhythm and rhyme match \"Jabberwocky\" as much as possible. Need to invent more words that fit the theme. Let me check the syllable count for each line to maintain the meter. Once the poem is structured, review for the whimsical feel and nonsense words that still convey the action and imagery related to an umbrella's role in battling the elements.\n</think>\n\n**The Brollumbry**  \n\nBeware the Brollumbry, my son!  \nThe jaws that bite, the limbs that snap—  \nBeware the Frumious Flish that run  \nWhen Whiffling winds begin to yap.  \n\nBeware the Jabberjaws’ sharp rain,  \nThe snicker-snack of lightning’s frill!  \nA rustling comes, a soggertain—  \nBeware, the Splinkter winks to kill!  \n\nHe took the Brollumbry in hand,  \nWith Glibblejaws and Flish aflur—  \nA Tulgey shield of soggysaund,  \nHe strode into the Splinkter’s blur.  \n\n“Twas Brillig, and the Wizzlethaws  \nDid gyre and gimble in the air;  \nAll Frabjul were the Momecaws,  \nAnd Grawlixes mome’d their lair.”  \n\nHe thrust at Throcklepox with zeal,  \nThe Wracksplosh howled and flailed in dread,  \nAs Umberell’s keen Jargons reel,  \nAnd Snicker-Snacks fled, manxomedead.  \n\nThrough Toves of downpour, thick as sloam,  \nHe charged with Brollumbry aglow—  \n“Oh, oozy Crawlux, quit thy foam!”  \nHe snathed the Snicker-Snacks below.  \n\nThe Frumious Flish did cease to slosh,  \nThe Jabberjaws retired to squall,  \nAnd as the Brollumbry’s might did slosh,  \nThe sun burst through the Galabargh’s squall.  \n\nSo keep, O Child, this Brollumbry true,  \nFor Throcklepox shall plague us still—  \n’Tis Umbra’s might, in all we do,  \nThat Flish and Splinkters cannot chill.", "info": {"topic": "umbrella"}, "reward": 0.8888888888888888, "label": "high", "criteria_yes": 16, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.8888888888888888, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}}

Let me start by recalling the key elements of \"Jabberwocky\". It's known for its nonsense words, playful language, and whimsical imagery, often blending real and fantastical elements. The structure typically involves quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme and a consistent meter, probably iambic tetrameter.\n\nFirst, I need to capture the essence of Monte Carlo. It's a place associated with luxury, casinos, the Mediterranean, and events like the Grand Prix. I should incorporate these elements but infuse them with Carroll's whimsy. So, maybe invent some portmanteau words or fantastical terms related to gambling or racing.\n\nThe title should be catchy and alliterative, perhaps something like \"The Monaco Mome\" since \"mome\" is a term from \"Jabberwocky\" meaning a foolish person. That fits with the gambling theme where fortunes are won and lost.\n\nNext, the structure. Each stanza should follow the ABAB rhyme scheme. Let me think of the first stanza setting the scene. \"Beware the Monaco Mome, my son!\" introduces the warning, similar to \"Beware the Jabberwock\". Then mention the \"jubjub jets\" (private planes?) and \"frumious Spa\" (a play on \"frumious\" from the original and the circuit de Monaco near the spa).\n\nFor the second stanza, describe the approach to Monte Carlo. \"Pallid palms\" for the palm trees, \"sulky sea\" for the Mediterranean. Maybe the \"ITSY BITSY band\" for live music adding to the ambiance.\n\nThird stanza could focus on the casino. \"The burbly bright roulette spins\" with onomatopoeia like \"glib-glib-grow\" for the wheel. \"Mimble mimble\" for the chips and \"mome\" going broke. Include a \"frabjulice\" cocktail, mixing gambling and drinking.\n\nFourth stanza introduces the Grand Prix. \"Avitalian autos\" for the racing cars, \"gyre\" for the track's turns. \"Fizzle frazzle\" for the engine sounds, \"flarping fans\" cheering. The checkered flag \"vawt\" and the winner's \"gallant glee\".\n\nFifth stanza could be about the aftermath, sunset over the sea. \"Galumphing\" waves and \"gallimaufry\" (a dish made from leftovers) of dreams. Ending with a warning to heed the moral about the Mome's gamble.\n\nNeed to ensure each stanza flows with the right meter and maintains the whimsical vocabulary. Check that invented words are consistent with Carroll's style and that the Monte Carlo elements are recognizable but twisted into fantastical terms. Rhymes should be clever and not forced.

Click the tail’s helix keen—\" – the tail might refer to the camera's strap or a part, helix adds a twist. \"Frabjous negs in tanks unseen\" – negatives (negs) developing in tanks, \"frabjous\" is from the original. \n\nProcessing the film: \"Beware the Glee of D-76’s might—\" – D-76 is a film developer, personified. \"It stirs the shadows, dark of night—\" – developing process affecting shadows. \n\nLoading film: \"The mome raths with sprocket’s spin—\" – mome raths are from the original, sprocket holes in film. \"They thread the can, the reel within—\" – loading film into a camera. \n\nShooting scenes: \"And whether hansome squop or bright—\" – hansome could be handsome, squop maybe a subject. \"The roll’s guandanclank holds tight—\" – made-up words for the film roll's mechanism.\n\nFinal stanza: \"Oh frumious F-Stop, if thou wilt—\" – addressing the f-stop directly. \"Seize dawn’s soft gleam, the dusk’s last tilt—\" – capturing different lighting times. \"Thy whiffling prints shall kyre and dry—\" – printing photos, \"whiffling\" and \"kyre\" are nonsense verbs. \"All flumplenooks the heart doth fill!\" – emotional impact of photos, \"flumplenooks\" as a made-up term for that feeling.\n\nCheck rhythm and rhyme. Each line should have 8 syllables, iambic tetrameter. Rhyme scheme ABAB. Make sure the photography terms are woven in with the nonsense words. Avoid being too technical but still recognizable.

It's full of neologisms, nonsensical words that evoke vivid imagery, and a playful rhythm with a consistent meter.\n\nFirst, I need to brainstorm musical terms and twist them into Carroll-esque words. Words like \"meowzart\" (Mozart), \"pianoramble\" (piano + ramble), \"fiddledee\" (fiddle), \"clarinetwirl\" (clarinet + twirl). The structure of \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme and a trochaic tetrameter. I should maintain that rhythm.\n\nThe poem should tell a whimsical story with a sense of adventure, perhaps a journey through the music room encountering various instruments. Maybe include some playful creatures derived from musical elements, like \"saxsquatch\" or \"trombloop\". Need to create a narrative flow: entering the room, encountering different instruments, a climax with a crescendo, and a gentle conclusion.\n\nCheck for consistency in meter. Each line should have eight syllables. Test lines like \"Beware the meowzart’s whimsy tune\" – yes, that's eight. Rhymes need to be slant rhymes where necessary, as Carroll did. Use alliteration and assonance for musicality.\n\nAlso, ensure the title is catchy and fits the style. \"The Mewzart’s Musicroom\" plays on Mozart and \"musicroom\". Capitalize some invented words for emphasis. Let me piece it together, stanza by stanza, making sure each line adheres to the structure and whimsy.

Lewis Carroll's poem uses made-up words that sound meaningful but aren't, playful language, and a whimsical yet slightly dark tone. The structure is quatrains with a consistent rhyme scheme, usually ABAB.\n\nSo, I need to capture that essence. First, create a title that's a nonsense word, maybe something like \"Déjàvulgar\" to combine \"déjà vu\" with a Carroll-esque twist. Then, the first line should set the scene. Carroll starts with \"Twas brillig and the slithy toves...\", so maybe \"When mormings mimsy crawl withgrave...\" using \"mormings\" (a blend of morning and something else) and \"mimsy\" (from the original) to keep the feel.\n\nNext, incorporate elements of déjà vu—familiar scenes, confusion between past and present. Use made-up creatures or actions. For example, \"the wizzlewhacks in whirligroves\" could represent the swirling confusion. The protagonist should face a challenge, like the \"manxome foe\" in Jabberwocky. Here, maybe the \"Gloomvolk\" that whispers \"You've been here before.\"\n\nThe middle stanzas need to build the conflict, using nonsense verbs and nouns. Maybe \"Burbling brooks reverse their flow\" to show time distortion. Include a call to action, like \"Take the vorpal sword of thought...\" but twist it to relate to memory. The climax could involve confronting the feeling, \"Slay the gawgler in the maze...\" to emphasize overcoming confusion.\n\nEnd with a resolution, returning home but changed, \"And the mome raths gnash their teeth...\" leaving the reader with a lingering sense of the experience. Check the rhyme scheme, make sure each stanza follows ABAB. Use alliteration and playful language throughout. Avoid real explanations, keep it abstract. Ensure the poem flows like Jabberwocky with its whimsical logic. Read it aloud to test the rhythm. Make adjustments where lines feel forced. That should capture déjà vu in Carroll's style.\n</think>\n\n**Déjàvulgar**  \nWhen mormings mimsy crawl withgrave,  \nAnd wizzlewhacks in whirligroves play,  \nBeware the Gloomvolk’s whispered wave—  \n*“You’ve been here before,”* it hisses gray.  \n\n‘Tis frabjulux to find the path  \nWhere mem’ries sink in silted time,  \nThe snicker-snee of what-is aftermath  \nJabbers through the jingled chime.  \n\nBurbling brooks reverse their flow,  \nThe mome raths gnash their trilled teeth,  \nYet all seems stitched from what’s been sewn—  \nA flumplenux of half-woke sheen.  \n\n“Take the vorpal sword of *not*,” they quire,  \n“Slay the gawgler in the maze!”  \nBut clocks conspire in pyrrh McGuire—  \n*Un*birth the now, relive the daze.  \n\nOh, beamish dream, when shoons grow wan,  \nAnd mawcuses hum their thrice-told tune,  \nClutch the frithy frazzle of the van—  \nDéjàvulgar is *never* soon.  \n\nCome home, come ho—though roads retread,  \nThe flazzlepox of *known* lags near…  \nThe Gloomvolk shrinks.

Let me recall that 'Jabberwocky' by Lewis Carroll is known for its nonsense words, playful language, and whimsical rhythm. So, I need to mimic that style.\n\nFirst, I should think about the structure. 'Jabberwocky' uses quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme and a galloping meter. I'll need to maintain that. The title should be catchy and a bit nonsensical, maybe something like \"The Frumious Wings\" to incorporate a Carroll-esque portmanteau.\n\nNow, the theme is stage wings. I need to personify them and describe their role in the theater. Use whimsical terms related to theater like \"curtain's call,\" \"spotlights swirl,\" \"props,\" \"lines.\" Maybe create some nonsense verbs or adjectives, like \"flumplenooks\" or \"jowlywacks\" to give that Jabberwocky feel.\n\nIn the first stanza, set the scene with the wings waiting. Use words like \"mimsy\" and \"gallant\" to evoke Carroll's language. Then, introduce action with the curtain rising. Maybe something like \"When the mimsy moon ascends\" to indicate the start of the performance.\n\nIn the second stanza, talk about the chaos backstage. Words like \"Frumious\" (a mix of furious and tremendous), \"Burble\" (a nonsense word), and \"Wuggle\" (another made-up verb) can create that playful confusion. Mention props and actors rushing.\n\nThird stanza could focus on the climax of the play. \"Mome\" is a term from the original poem, meaning a fool, so \"Mome Wrack\" could be a character. Use \"galumphing\" to describe energetic movements. The stagehands work \"with beavers' speed\" to highlight their frantic activity.\n\nThe final stanza should resolve with the curtain falling. \"Outgrib\" means to depart, so \"outgrib the fray\" fits. The wings rest again, waiting for the next show. End with a whimsical couplet: \"Till the theatre’s wild whimsy calls / ‘Curtain up!’ another day.\"\n\nCheck for rhyme scheme and rhythm. Each stanza should have four lines with ABAB rhymes. Ensure the meter is consistent, around 8-10 syllables per line. Use alliteration and playful language throughout. Avoid being too literal; keep it imaginative and a bit absurd, just like the original.\n\nPossible adjustments: Make sure the nonsense words fit naturally and don't disrupt the flow. Read it aloud to test the rhythm. Maybe change \"jowlywacks\" to something that better fits the meter. Ensure the theme of stage wings is clear through the metaphors and actions described.\n\nAlright, time to put it all together with the title and structure, ensuring each stanza captures a part of the stage wings' experience in the whimsical, Jabberwocky style.\n</think>\n\n**The Frumious Wings**  \n\nBeneath the curtain’s mimsy shade,  \nWhere gallant gloam and glee conflux,  \nThe Frumious Wings in whispers trade—  \n“Beware the Flarp!

Let me start by recalling what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique.

The process involves melting butter, skimming the milk solids, and the nutty aroma that develops. I should use vivid imagery and maybe some invented words to give it that Carroll-esque feel.\n\nThe title should be attention-grabbing and alliterative, maybe something like \"The Brown Butter's Frumious Fricassee\". \"Frumious\" is a blend of \"fuming\" and \"furious\", which Carroll used, so that fits.\n\nNow, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. I'll follow that. Start the first stanza with a warning or introduction, similar to \"Beware the Jabberwock\". Maybe \"Beware the froth, the sizzle, the crackle’s might\".\n\nNext, describe the process: melting, bubbles, the transformation. Use whimsical terms. \"Take thy cream, fresh-churned by moonlit stream\" sets the scene. Then the cooking process with \"fire’s fierce gleam\" and \"frothless, dreamless\". \n\nIntroduce the hissing and the froth rising. \"Beware the Hiss that frabjous vapors brew\" – \"frabjous\" is another Carroll term. Mention the nutty scent and the color changing. Maybe \"As whey-kissed curds in spirals magnify\" to describe the milk solids.\n\nEmphasize the patience required, as burning is a risk. \"Let none despise the watchful, wary eye\" – highlights the need for attention. The result is a \"savourous sigh\" and the joy of success. \n\nEnd with the joy of spreading it on bread, \"Taste the still-sigh of brown where gold doth lie\". Maybe a playful twist at the end, like \"Else back to churn—‘twas naught but curdled dream!\" to warn against failure.\n\nCheck the meter and rhyme. Each line should have eight syllables, ABAB rhyme. Read it aloud to ensure it flows. Adjust any lines that stumble. Make sure the invented words fit naturally, enhancing the whimsy without losing meaning.

The rhythm is also important—maintaining a consistent meter, likely iambic tetrameter, with some variations for effect.\n\nI need to ensure that the nonsense words still convey a sense of eeriness and sneakiness associated with \"creep.\" Words that sound slimy, sneaky, or slithering might help. Also, alliteration and assonance will add to the musical quality, making it feel more like Carroll's work.\n\nLet me draft some lines. Start with a warning, like \"Beware the Creepicker-Snipe...\" Then describe its features and actions. Maybe include some action verbs that are playful yet creepy. Check the syllable count to keep the rhythm consistent. Revise any lines that stumble to maintain flow.\n\nFinally, the title should encapsulate the main creature and hint at the poem's theme. \"The Creepicker-Snipe\" seems fitting. Once the poem is structured, read it aloud to test the rhythm and ensure it captures the essence of both \"creep\" and \"Jabberwocky.\"\n</think>\n\n**The Creepicker-Snipe**  \n\nBeware the Creepicker-Snipe, my son,  \nWith slinklepox eyes and a frizzle fraze,  \nIt glimmers and gloops ‘neath the glibblejaws sun,  \nAnd burbles with blix in its wuggle waze.  \n\nIts teeth are long slivvers, its claws all a-splay,  \nIt frabjams and flazzles with glinchy glee,  \nIt’ll snickerwot through the jim-jam hay,  \nAnd jabber your joy with a wumplenax knee.  \n\n“Oh frumplenux!

{"i": 30, "prompt": "Write a poem about awl in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about an awl in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Let me recall what 'Jabberwocky' is like. It's got lots of made-up words, playful language, a rhythmic structure, and a whimsical, almost nonsense feel but with some underlying meaning.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the awl as a subject. An awl is a pointed tool used for piercing holes in materials like leather. But in Carroll's style, I should personify it and maybe make it part of a fantastical world. So the title should be catchy and a bit nonsensical, perhaps with a play on words. Maybe \"The Awl and the Oomlout\"? \"Oomlout\" sounds like a made-up creature, which fits.\n\nNow the structure. 'Jabberwocky' has a consistent meter and rhyme scheme, usually ABAB with four-line stanzas. Each stanza tells a piece of the story with vivid imagery. I need to create that same flow. Start with a setting, maybe a strange landscape. Use alliteration and portmanteau words. \n\nFirst stanza: Introduce the protagonist and the quest. Something like \"Beware the Awl, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that clutch— Beware the oomlout's frumious snout...\" Mixing real words with invented ones, maintaining the rhythm.\n\nNext, describe the journey through a fantastical environment. Use vivid, nonsense words for the setting. Maybe a \"burble\" brook, \"mome\" grass. Then introduce the awl as a tool with a mind of its own. \"He seized the Awl with manxome hand...\" The Awl should have a sinister yet whimsical presence.\n\nBuild up the action: the battle with the \"frumious Bandersnatch\" or another creature. Use words that evoke the idea of piercing and sewing but in a combat scenario. Maybe \" FOOM! went the Awl, in a turbulent streak, It stitched the Bandersnatch's griffin shriek...\" Combining the tool's function with fantastical combat.\n\nAdd some vivid, absurd imagery. \"The mimsy borogoves danced in a rout As the Awl snicker-snacked its way without...\" Incorporating creatures from the original poem but giving them new actions related to the awl's effects.\n\nConclude with the protagonist's victory and the aftermath. \"And lo! The youth stood, beamish and bright, The oomlouts fled to the yondering night...\" Keeping the triumphant yet dreamlike ending.\n\nCheck the meter and rhyme. Each line should have roughly eight syllables, with the second and fourth lines rhyming. Read through to ensure the flow matches Carroll's style. Make sure the made-up words fit naturally and contribute to the imagery.\n\nFinally, the title should reflect the central conflict or curious elements. \"The Awl and the Oomlout\" suggests a duel or encounter between the tool and a fantastical creature, which fits the 'Jabberwocky' structure of a heroic quest against bizarre foes.\n</think>\n\n**The Awl and the Oomlout**  \n\nBeware the Awl, my son!  \nThe jaws that bite, the claws that clutch—  \nBeware the *oomlout’s* frumious snout,  \nAnd shun the tulgey glade’s green hutch!  \n\nHe took the vorpal blade in hand,  \nWith threads of thorn and silken wrath,  \nLong time the manxome *borb* to scan—  \nHe sought the *Awl* of Serpentine Path.  \n\nAnd as he wandered, lost in thicket,  \nA *mome* brook babbled, *flarp* and wide,  \nWhen *WHAM!* with a *stitch* and a flicker-flack,  \nThe Awl’s sharp snout his trouser’s hide did nick.  \n\n“Beware the Oomlout’s frothy flee!”  \nThe sweating youth did frabjul exclaim,  \nFor in the mist, with eyes agleam,  \nIt loomed—a *wizzle* with tentacled frame!  \n\nHe swung the Awl with manxome might,  \nThrough *glib* gunk, through *glorp* and through goo,  \nIt pierced the beast with a *twiddle* sound,  \nThen stitched it shut with a *yarl* and a “*Soooo! *”  \n\nThe *flumplenooks* cheered, *flib* and tall,  \nAs oomlout’s *fizzle* dissolved to foam,  \nFor where the Awl had snicker-snacked,  \nOnly a *squelch* remained—*mome* and *home*.  \n\n“Let all this tale in *Galumph* be told,”  \nThe youth declared, with a beamish grin,  \nFor he’d learned well, by *jigg* and by *jog*,  \nA *stitch* in time could tame the *glint*-toothed *slith* within.", "info": {"topic": "awl"}, "reward": 0.9444444444444444, "label": "high", "criteria_yes": 17, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.9444444444444444, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 1.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "label_high": 1.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}}
{"i": 31, "prompt": "Compose a poem on layover bay in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about Layover Bay in the style of \"Jabberwocky\". Let me start by recalling the key elements of Carroll's poem. It's full of neologisms, playful language, and a whimsical yet adventurous tone. The structure is quatrains with a consistent ABAB rhyme scheme.\n\nFirst, I need to invent some nonsensical words that sound like they belong in the Jabberwocky universe. Words like \"flumplenooks\" or \"snickerfracks\" could work. They should evoke a sense of fantastical creatures or strange phenomena.\n\nNext, setting the scene at Layover Bay. It's a transitional place, a layover, so maybe it's a liminal space where travelers get stuck. I can describe the confusion and the strange sights one might encounter there. The bay could have mysterious elements, like shifting sands or eerie lights.\n\nI should include a narrative thread, perhaps a traveler trying to navigate through the bay, facing obstacles. The Jabberwocky has a clear storyline with a hero's quest, so maybe the protagonist here is trying to escape Layover Bay, encountering bizarre creatures along the way.\n\nRhyme scheme is crucial. Let me plan the quatrains with the second and fourth lines rhyming. For example, \"flew\" and \"brew\" in the first stanza. I need to maintain that structure throughout.\n\nAlso, internal rhymes and alliteration will add to the musicality. Phrases like \"silken, sad, uncertain\" in the original can be mirrored with descriptive, dreamy language here.\n\nPotential challenges: ensuring the made-up words don't disrupt the flow and that the poem remains cohesive. I should test the rhythm by reading it aloud, even if just mentally.\n\nLet me outline the stanzas. Start with the approach to Layover Bay, then the strange encounters, the attempts to leave, and a resolution, perhaps escaping or finding their way despite the confusion.\n\nCheck for consistency in meter. Carroll uses trochaic tetrameter, so aiming for a similar cadence would help. Each line should have eight syllables, with stressed-unstressed patterns.\n\nNow, drafting lines, playing with the invented words and maintaining the structure. Revise for flow and adherence to the style. Ensure the title reflects the theme and has an alliterative or whimsical touch, like \"Layover Lament by Lunatic Tides\".\n</think>\n\n**Layover Lament by Lunatic Tides**  \n’Twas glimmerblinck when travelers drew  \nTo Layover Bay, where skies brew  \nA fizz of flight, a fume of fuss—  \nBeware the Flarp that flops in slush!  \n\nLong shloofs loomed by the dock’s dull groin,  \nAnd Glibblejaws gnawed tickets vain.  \n“Beware the Snurk’s outlandish toll,”  \nThe pamphlets pled in pixel’d sprawl.  \n\nThrough mazzlepox of signs they strayed,  \nWhere kiosks sold voids in stale, warm bread.  \n“Turn left!

{"i": 32, "prompt": "Create a poem about desire path in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about a \"desire path\" in the style of \"Jabberwocky\". Let me start by recalling what \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll is like. It's got made-up words, playful language, a whimsical and fantastical tone, and a clear structure with rhyming verses and a consistent meter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a \"desire path\" is. From what I know, it's a path that emerges where people naturally want to walk, often unofficial and created by foot traffic, as opposed to planned paths. So the poem should metaphorically explore the idea of following one's desires or the paths less formally structured.\n\nNow, blending that with the Jabberwock style. Carroll uses nonsense words that often have a hint of meaning, so maybe I can invent some terms related to paths, nature, and desire. Words like \"flumplenooks\", \"snicker-snack\", \"galumphing\" come to mind from the original. I should create similar-sounding words that relate to the theme here.\n\nStructure-wise, \"Jabberwocky\" has four-line stanzas with an AABB rhyme scheme and a trochaic tetrameter rhythm. I need to maintain that structure. Let's plan the stanzas: maybe start by introducing the desire path, then the journey along it, obstacles, and a resolution or conclusion.\n\nIn the first stanza, set the scene of the path appearing where it shouldn't. Use alliteration and invented words. Next, describe the traveler moving through the landscape. Include some fantastical creatures or obstacles. The third stanza could talk about the path twisting and the challenges faced. Then, perhaps a moment of doubt or fear, followed by determination. Finally, the triumph or success of following the desire path.\n\nNeed to make sure each stanza flows into the next, maintaining the rhythm. Also, include a strong verb phrase, like \"he chortled in his joy\" from the original. Maybe something like \"with a flick of his wrist\" or \"galumphing with glee\".\n\nCheck for made-up words that still convey the intended meaning. For example, \"flibbertigibbets\" in Carroll's poem are whimsical creatures; here, maybe \"flibulous shadows\" or \"wizzle-whacks\". Also, ensure that the invented words aren't too obscure but fit the rhythm.\n\nTest the meter by reading lines aloud. Each line should have eight syllables with a trochaic beat. If a line feels forced, adjust the wording without losing the whimsy. For instance, \"‘Twas brillig and the slithy toves\" becomes \"'Twas glimmer where the wilder wove,\" keeping the structure.\n\nInclude a narrative arc: the desire path appears, the traveler chooses to follow it despite obstacles, uses some metaphorical tools (like a sword in Jabberwocky), and succeeds. The message is about heeding one's desires and overcoming challenges through persistence.\n\nFinally, the title should be catchy and in the style of \"Jabberwocky\". Maybe \"The Desire Path's Frabjous Trail\" or something similar, using \"frabjous\" which means wonderful in Carroll's language.\n\nPutting it all together, ensuring each stanza follows the rhyme scheme, the invented words make sense in context, and the theme is clear. Check for any lines that might stumble and refine them for a smooth, playful flow.\n</think>\n\n**The Desire Path's Frabjous Trail**  \n\n'Twas glimmer where the wilder wove,  \nAnd mome raths of reason slept—  \n\"Maze no more!\" the walker rove,  \nWith a flick and a froth he stepped.  \n\n\"Beware the Snickerjibits, my son!  \nThe frumious foes of the straight,\"  \nThe signs all quacked, but he'd begun  \nTo tread the path that wasn't there to wait.  \n\nHe vaulted vales of vellichor,  \nWhere flibulous shadows loomed,  \nAnd the wizzle-whacks of \"No Trespass\" lore  \nSplintered 'neath his stomping brogues.  \n\nWith mimsy map in grip (now rent),  \nHe galumphed through gorse and gloam,  \nTill the mazes of obedient bent  \nCurled up like a lazy stoat.  \n\n\"Oh frabjous path!\" he chortled high,  \nAs the soil sang beneath his tread,  \nFor the wisp that wisps the wanderer's eye  \nLays the road where none is spread.", "info": {"topic": "desire path"}, "reward": 0.6111111111111112, "label": "medium", "criteria_yes": 11, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.6111111111111112, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 1.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}}

It's known for its made-up words, playful language, and whimsical imagery. The structure is traditional ballad form, with quatrains and an ABAB rhyme scheme. Nonsense verse that still conveys vivid, fantastical scenes.\n\nSo the challenge here is to blend the science fair theme with Carroll's style. Need to create portmanteaus and fantastical terms related to science. Words like \"volatube\" or \"thermoflux\" could mimic his invented language. Maybe include elements common to science fairs: experiments, projects, maybe some chaos or creatures (like robots or chemical reactions) coming to life.\n\nStart with a title. Maybe \"The Scienciock\" as a portmanteau of \"science\" and \"Jabberwock\". Then set the scene with a call to action, like \"Beware the...mnemonite...\" similar to \"Jabberwock\"'s opening. Each stanza should have four lines, with alternating rhymes.\n\nIncorporate scientific elements with whimsical twists: \"volatube\" for a volatile experiment, \"snicker-snacks\" from the original could become science tools. Maybe a mentor figure (like the \"old man\" in Jabberwocky) handing out supplies. Include some conflict, like experiments gone wrong, then resolution with a successful fair.\n\nNeed to maintain the rhythm and meter. Iambic tetrameter, four beats per line. Check syllable count to keep it flowing. Use alliteration and assonance to enhance the musicality.

Maybe \"Momeflumes\" for mist creatures, \"Jimjam trees\" for trees affected by fog. Use alliteration and nonsense verbs, like \"wuggle\", \"wumplenooks\", \"grimplesnatch\".\n\nInclude actions that the fog does, like creeping, swirling, maybe interacting with the environment. Add a sense of movement and playfulness. Maybe the fog has a life of its own, \"gallywomp through the glimmerglass\" to give it motion.\n\nMaintain the whimsical and slightly mysterious tone. Use hyphenated compound words for that Jabberwocky feel: \"frothlewock\", \"dewsnap\", \"flibulous\", \"fizzlethorns\". Each stanza should build the imagery of the fog taking over the landscape, then perhaps retreating.\n\nEnsure each line flows smoothly with the meter. Read aloud to check the rhythm. Avoid forced rhymes but keep the AABB scheme. End with the fog disappearing as the sun rises, leaving the scene transformed but fleeting.\n\nCheck for consistency in the invented words and that they contribute to the fog theme.

It uses made-up terms that sound meaningful but aren't real, creating a sense of wonder and confusion.\n\nSo, I need to apply that style to a conference room setting. First, brainstorming some elements of a conference room: tables, chairs, whiteboards, projectors, meetings, discussions, maybe coffee cups, pens, notepads. Now, how to twist these into fantastical terms. For example, \"table\" could become \"flumplenax,\" \"chair\" might be \"jimjam.\" The whiteboard could be a \"glintzenboard\" where ideas are \"squinjled\" with markers.\n\nNext, the poem's structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. Each stanza introduces some action or creature. The conference room poem should follow a similar structure. Start with a warning, maybe about the dangers of the conference room, like \"Beware the Frumious Flapdoodle.\" Then describe the setting with invented verbs and nouns.\n\nIncorporate the meeting process: gathering, discussing, decisions. Each stanza can tackle a different aspect. Maybe include a \"Burble\" that's a mix of voices, or \"Gleeps\" and \"Snicker-Snacks\" as metaphors for meeting chaos. The climax could be the moment a decision is made, symbolized by slaying a \"Frumious Flapdoodle,\" leading to a successful outcome.\n\nCheck the rhythm. Each line should have a similar meter to the original, which is primarily iambic tetrameter. Testing syllable counts to ensure flow. Use alliteration and assonance where possible to enhance the musicality.\n\nPossible lines: \"The Glintzenboards did squinjle and fray, As Burble-wumps began their say.\" Here, \"Glintzenboards\" are whiteboards, \"squinjle\" the writing, \"Burble-wumps\" the murmur of voices.\n\nInclude a stanza about the aftermath: decisions made, papers signed, the room returning to normal. End with a triumphant note, similar to the original's conclusion.\n\nEnsure the title is catchy and fits the nonsense style, like \"The Frumious Flapdoodle of Meeting Hall.\" Double-check that all made-up words contribute to the imagery and that the poem maintains a playful yet challenging tone, staying true to Carroll's spirit.\n</think>\n\n**The Frumious Flapdoodle of Meeting Hall**  \n\nBeware the Glintzenboards, my son,  \nThe Squibblejaws that mumble late,  \nBeware the Jabbermote and shun  \nThe frumious Flapdoodle’s frantic debate.  \n\nHe took the Vorpal Pen in hand—  \nThe Tweedlefolk all snicker-snacked—  \nLong time the Flishy Chairs did stand  \nAs Burble-wumps in air were packed.  \n\nBeware the Frumious Flapdoodle’s scrawl,  \nItsSnicker-Snacks and Gleeps of dread.  \nIt mimsy-mixed the Quizzle’s squall  \nWhen Jabberwocks of deadlines bled.  \n\nHe globbered through the Slithy Halls,  \nWhere Wizzlewhacks in circles dyed,  \nAnd FrabjousGroans from all the stalls  \nAs Kettlepots the minutes fried.  \n\n Aloft the Frumious Flapdoodle flew,  \nWhen all the Meeting’s Flishes cried:  \n“’Tis done!

The structure is four-line stanzas with a consistent rhyme scheme, often ABAB.\n\nFirst, the title. \"Jabberwocky\" has a whimsical, made-up name.

Lewis Carroll's poem uses a lot of nonsense words, playful language, and a rhythm that's catchy and a bit quirky. The structure is quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme.\n\nFirst, I need to capture the essence of screen burn-in. That's when images get stuck on a screen, right? So terms like \"phosphor's plight\", \"static specter\", \"LED's last sigh\" might work. I should create some portmanteaus or made-up words similar to Carroll's style. Words like \"glowfluke\" or \"pixel's plight\".\n\nThe original 'Jabberwocky' has a narrative of battling a monstrous creature. Maybe the monster here is the burn-in itself. So the protagonist would be trying to defeat it with certain actions—like \"twirling thumbs of speed\" or \"swiping spells unspoken\". The battle could involve refreshing the screen or changing images to prevent the burn-in.\n\nI need to maintain the rhyme scheme. Let me check each stanza. The first stanza ends with \"wabe\" and \"Jabberwock\" in the original. Here, maybe \"glow\" and \"plight\" with the burn-in's approach. Make sure each line has a similar syllable count to keep the rhythm.\n\nAlso, include some alliteration and assonance. For example, \"frumious fumes\" becomes \"flicker's grim decree\" and \"static specter\". The middle stanza can introduce the fight against burn-in with tools like \"apps of motion\" and \"backlight's golden key\".\n\nEnding with a warning, like the original's \"and wiped its nose\", so maybe \"Beware the Burn-in's creep\" and a solution like rotating images. Need to tie it all together with the playful language and nonsense terms while conveying the concept of screen burn-in.

It has a strong rhythmic pattern, often anapestic tetrameter, and playful language.\n\nSo, the title needs to be catchy and a bit whimsical. Maybe something like \"The Underpass Frumious\" to reference the \"frumious Bandersnatch\" from the original. That way, it ties in directly with Carroll's style.\n\nNow, the subject is the echo in an underpass. I need to describe the setting with vivid, made-up words. The underpass could be a \"gallivanting tunnel\" or \"gralloch-stoned\" to give it that fantastical feel. The echo itself should have a life of its own—maybe personify it as a creature. Words like \"flibbertigibbet\" or \"mimsy\" could work here.\n\nI should incorporate some of the sound devices from \"Jabberwocky,\" like alliteration and assonance. Phrases like \"weresome winds\" or \"tatterfoal shadows\" add to the musicality. The structure should have quatrains with a consistent rhyme scheme, probably ABAB.\n\nAlso, the poem needs a narrative flow, even if it's abstract. Maybe start by setting the scene at dusk, introduce the echo as a mysterious entity, and then the interaction between the traveler and the echo. Ending with a warning or a reflection, similar to the original's cautionary tone.\n\nLet me check the meter. Each line should have four stressed syllables. For example: \"Beware the underpass by dusk's dim gaze,\" stresses on Beware, under-pass, dusk's, dim, gaze? Hmm, maybe adjust that. \"Beware the underpass by dusk's pale gaze\" might flow better.\n\nIncorporate some neologisms: \"frothglit,\" \"splinches,\" \"flabulum,\" \"gallishades.\" These words should hint at their meanings through context. The echo \"flibbertigibbet\" suggests it's whimsical or flighty. The shadows \"tatterfoal\" could mean tattered and foal-like, moving unpredictably.\n\nMake sure the last stanza ties back to the title and the echo's effect. The traveler is both intrigued and warned, leaving the reader with that eerie, memorable feeling from \"Jabberwocky.\"\n\nOkay, putting it all together. Title first, then stanzas with the made-up words, maintaining the rhythm and rhyme. Check each line's meter and adjust where necessary.

It's a nonsense poem by Lewis Carroll with made-up words, playful language, and a whimsical rhythm. So I need to capture that whimsy and invent some terms related to déjà vu.\n\nFirst, the title. 'Jabberwocky' has a unique title, so maybe something like \"The Déjà Vu Frumious\" to blend the French term with Carroll's style. Next, the structure. The original has a consistent meter and rhyme scheme, usually ABAB. I should follow that.\n\nDeja vu is that feeling of familiarity. I need to personify it, maybe as a creature or a phenomenon. Carroll uses creatures like the Jabberwock, so perhaps something like \"the Snicker-Snack of When\" or \"the vorpal Glint of Yore\". Those phrases have a Carroll-esque ring.\n\nIncorporate some of the original's phrases subtly, like \"Beware the...\" and \"my son\". Then build stanzas around the experience of deja vu: confusion, time loops, memory tricks. Use alliteration and rhyming nonsense words. Maybe lines like \"The mome waltzes, the mimsy sway\" to mimic the rhythm.\n\nCheck the meter. Each line should be eight syllables, with a trochaic tetrameter. Let me draft a few lines and see. For example:\n\n\"Beware the Déjà’s frumious grin,\nMy son, with its blerjum spin,\nA whiffling space where moments twine—\n‘Tis a loop of mind, all yours and mine.\"\n\nThat seems to fit. Continue with the confusion of time, the uncertainty. Maybe add a stanza where the protagonist confronts the feeling, only to realize it's elusive. End with a whimsical twist, like the feeling escaping or the speaker questioning reality.\n\nEnsure the made-up words sound plausible within the poem's context. Words like \"blerjum\", \"flibulous haze\", \"throcklepox of When\" should evoke curiosity without being too obscure. Maintain the playful tone throughout, mixing real and invented language.\n\nOnce the stanzas are drafted, read through to check flow and rhyme. Adjust any lines that stumble or break the meter.

The title should probably be a nonsense word, maybe a combination of musical terms and 'jubjub' or 'bandersnatch' like Carroll did. Let me think... \"Jabberwocky\" has words like \"slithy\", \"mome\", \"frumious\". I need to invent words that sound musical or related to instruments.\n\nThe music room setting: maybe instruments that come alive, whimsical creatures made of music notes or instruments. The poem should have a narrative, perhaps a quest or encountering fantastical beings. Carroll uses a lot of alliteration and assonance, so I should focus on that.\n\nStart with the title. Maybe \"The Mimsy Melodiitre\" – \"mimsy\" is from the original, and \"Melodiitre\" combines melody with a creature-like suffix. Then the first stanza sets the scene. \"Beware the Solfa and the Shrieves of createTime\" – Solfa relates to solfège, Shrieves could be a mix of shriek and leaves. \"createTime\" instead of \"crutch time\" or something time-related.\n\nNext, the music room itself. \"Tumtum ersatz in harmony's maze\" – Tumtum is a drum, ersatz means substitute, harmony's maze gives a sense of winding through music. Then action verbs: \"Beware the waltz-wumps and the crescendo’s blare\" – waltz-wumps as a nonsense creature, crescendo's blare for loud sounds.\n\nInventing creatures: \"Frabjulon fifes\" – frabjulon from \"frabjous\" in the original, fifes as flutes. \"Mingled with throcklepox\" – throcklepox sounds like a made-up instrument or creature. \"Gleebeasts\" combining glee and beasts, \"fiddledee bows\" with \"fiddle\" and a playful \"dee\".\n\nIncluding a plot where the protagonist interacts with these creatures. \"So I brandished a baton of boom and of sway\" – conducting with a baton, \" crashcleff\" combining crash and clef. \"Jingled the jim-jam in jollivet’s spin\" – alliteration and playful actions.\n\nCrescendo towards the end: \"The Shrieves all shrank from the melody’s roar!\" – the creatures react to the music. \"My Solfa I slew with a rondo’s refrain\" – defeating the Solfa creature with a musical term rondo. Ending with \"Then burbled the bassoons, ‘Bravo! Encore!’\" – instruments reacting positively.\n\nNeed to check the meter and rhyme scheme. 'Jabberwocky' is in quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme, alternating lines of iambic tetrameter and trimeter. Let me verify each stanza's rhythm and rhyme. Also, ensure that the made-up words blend seamlessly with real musical terms to maintain the whimsical feel without being too obscure.\n\nRevise any lines that don't flow smoothly, ensuring the nonsense words contribute to the musical theme. Make sure the title fits the structure and the overall poem captures the essence of a lively, fantastical music room as per Carroll's style.\n</think>\n\n**The Mimsy Melodiitre**  \n\nBeware the Solfa and the Shrieves of createTime,  \nThe flumplenooks that flibbertigibbet and scorn.  \nBeware the Jabberflute’s jazz-haunted chime  \nAnd the maelstrom that mumbles where metronomes yawn.  \n\n‘Twas brillig and the b.AddRange bled mellow,  \nAll whimsy-whirled were the waltzers of sound;  \nTumtum ersatz in harmony’s maze did dwell,  \nWhile the voxlooms burbled by bends of the ground.  \n\nI chortled in my clavecin’s cucurbit glove,  \n“Eftsoons I’ll rout this cacophonous horde!”  \nI seized a splink and a gliss of vapor-love,  \nThen grimbulged through the gamut, a trill to abhor.  \n\nBeware the waltz-wumps and the crescendo’s blare!  \nThe frabjulon fifes and the throcklepox throng,  \nBeware the gleebeasts’ fiddledee bows of air—  \nOne snicker-SOAP and thy souffle is wrong!  \n\nI galumphed through the glissando’s glimmer-gleam,  \nWhere tremolos tumbled in trills of disdain,  \nBut mome rhapsodes mumbled a moonlit theme,  \nAs IBacking opforte through thirds in the rain.  \n\nSo I brandished a baton of boom and of sway,  \nCrashcleff the crescendo in cotillions of fire,  \nJingled the jim-jam in jollivet’s spin—  \n“Frumious fanfares, I’ll frazzle thy mire!”  \n\nThe Shrieves all shrank from the melody’s roar!  \nMy Solfa I slew with a rondo’s refrain;  \nThe melodiitre mewed, “Mimsy no more!”  \nThen burbled the bassoons, “Bravo!

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about Layover Bay in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\". Let me start by recalling what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It's known for its nonsense words, playful language, and whimsical imagery. The structure is important too—it has a consistent rhyme scheme and meter, usually quatrains with an AABB rhyme scheme and trochaic tetrameter.\n\nFirst, I need to incorporate made-up words that evoke a sense of wonder and confusion, similar to Carroll's approach. Words like \"slithy\" or \"mome\" come to mind. So for Layover Bay, maybe I can create terms that sound nautical or aviation-related but with a twist. \n\nThe title should be catchy and maybe a bit of a mouthful, like \"The Layclocky Shore\". That rhymes with Jabberwocky and has a similar ring. Now, the setting: a bay that's a layover, so perhaps a place between destinations, a liminal space. I need to describe the creatures or features of this bay using nonsense words. \n\nImagery related to travel, waiting, maybe some fantastical elements. For example, \"flumplenooks\" could be birds or creatures that inhabit the area. \"Snicker-Snacks\" from the original could be referenced, maybe as something the traveler uses or encounters. \n\nThe rhythm and meter are crucial. Each line should have eight syllables with a trochaic beat. Let me draft a few lines and check the syllable count. \n\n\"Beware the Layclocky Shore,\nWhere flibberjays froth and roar,\"\n\nYes, that's eight syllables each. Now, the story: a traveler arrives at Layover Bay, encounters strange things, and perhaps has to navigate through them. The poem should have a sense of adventure and urgency, mirroring the original's quest narrative. \n\nIncorporate some of Carroll's techniques like alliteration and portmanteau words. Maybe \"mimsy\" travelers or \"galumphing\" ships. Also, internal rhymes and wordplay will add to the effect. \n\nNeed to ensure the poem flows smoothly and each stanza connects. Let me outline the stanzas: introduction of the setting, the creatures, the traveler's actions, the challenges faced, and a resolution or departure. \n\nCheck for consistency in the rhyme scheme. Each stanza should follow AABB. Let me test a stanza:\n\n\"He chortled at the mome rays,\nAs burblebeasts danced in bays,\"\n\n\"AABB\" works here. Now, make sure the made-up words aren't too obscure but still give a vivid image. The traveler's tools, like a \"vorpal blade\" in Jabberwocky, could be something like \"a ticking charm\" to navigate time. \n\nFinally, end with the traveler moving on, emphasizing the layover as a temporary stop. Maybe leave the reader with a sense of mystery, typical of Carroll's style. \n\nLet me piece it all together, ensuring the meter and rhymes are consistent, and the whimsical elements are present throughout. Revise any lines that stumble or break the rhythm.

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about a conference room in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" Let me start by recalling what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It's got made-up words, playful language, and a whimsical yet adventurous tone. The original has a lot of nonsense verse that still conveys vivid imagery and emotion.\n\nSo, the challenge here is to take the mundane setting of a conference room and infuse it with that same fantastical, absurd style. First, I need to brainstorm some invented terms that relate to office environments. Maybe things like \"Flargleverse\" or \"Quizzleplacks\" could represent elements of meetings or conference technology.\n\nI should think about the structure of \"Jabberwocky.\" It has stanzas with a consistent rhyme scheme, often AABB. The poem also tells a story with a narrative arc. Applying that here, the conference room poem could have a hero (maybe a meeting leader) facing challenges like malfunctioning tech or unproductive discussions.\n\nNext, I need to incorporate some of the original's linguistic tricks, like verbs ending in -ing or -led, and combining parts of words. Words like \"jabber\" and \"chortle\" come to mind. Maybe terms like \"Flermjamming\" or \"Zinglethorn\" can describe the act of speaking in meetings or the confusion that arises.\n\nI should also ensure the poem has a clear beginning, middle, and end. Starting with the hero entering the conference room, facing the \"beasts\" (like the \"Bandersnatch\" but here maybe the \"Snicker-Snack of deadlines\"), and then overcoming the challenges. Including a triumph at the end would mirror the original's structure.\n\nRhyming is crucial here. Each stanza should follow the AABB pattern. Let me draft a few lines to test the rhythm and rhyme. For example:\n\n\"Beware the Frabjulon firmware upgrade,\nThe claws that catch, theodes that raid—\nBeware the Flargleverse and shun\nThe Quizzleplacks that munch the dawn.\"\n\nThis uses invented words and maintains the rhyme scheme. Now, applying this to conference elements: whiteboards, projectors, coffee machines, etc. Maybe the \"Mome WRTs\" (Wireless Router Things) that fail to connect, or \"Burble-wocks\" representing empty jargon.\n\nI also need a title that's catchy and fits the style. \"The Jarglewock of Meeting's Bane\" plays off \"Jabberwocky\" and introduces a central antagonist for the conference room setting.\n\nNow, assembling the stanzas step by step, ensuring each part relates to the conference room experience, with the made-up words enhancing the imagery without losing the essence of the scene. Testing the flow and making sure the absurdity remains charming rather than confusing.\n\nFinally, checking that the poem stays true to the original's spirit while effectively capturing the conference room's chaos and the hero's journey through a successful meeting. Adjusting any lines that break the rhythm or don't contribute to the whimsical yet relatable portrayal.\n</think>\n\n**The Jarglewock of Meeting’s Bane**  \n\nBeware the Frabjulon firmware upgrade,  \nThe claws that catch, theodes that raid—  \nBeware the Flargleverse and shun  \nThe Quizzleplacks that munch the dawn.  \n\n’Twas brillig, all the mimsy mice  \nDid gyre in circles, minus vice.  \nThe Snicker-Snack of deadlines came,  \nAs bandersnatch’d round glassy frame.  \n\n“Beware the Jarglewock, my peers!”  \nThe CEO burbled through its gears.  \nIts eyes glowed like the LCD screen  \nThat fries the brain with charts unseen.  \n\nLong time the manxome conference sprawled,  \nBeneath the clock’s vorpal maw.  \nIt flumplenooks the whiteboard’s squeal,  \nWhile Jabberflax outclassed the zeal.  \n\nHe took the laser pointer’s might,  \nOne, two!

{"i": 45, "prompt": "Write a poem about creep in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about \"creep\" in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky.\" Let me start by recalling what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. Carroll uses invented words, playful language, and a rhythmic structure with a consistent meter, often iambic tetrameter. The poem also has a narrative, usually a quest or battle, filled with whimsical creatures and nonsense verse that still conveys meaning through sound and rhythm.\n\nFirst, the title. \"Jabberwocky\" itself is a nonsense word, so maybe I should create a similar-sounding title related to \"creep.\" Words like \"slithy,\" \"mome,\" \"galumphing\" come to mind. Let me think... \"Creepwuzzy\" could work, blending \"creep\" with a whimsical suffix, similar to \"Jabberwocky.\" So, the title could be \"The Creepwuzzy.\" \n\nNext, the structure. The original has four-line stanzas with an AABB rhyme scheme. Each line is about eight syllables. I need to maintain that rhythm. The first stanza of \"Jabberwocky\" sets the scene with \"twilight\" and introduces the fantastical elements. For \"The Creepwuzzy,\" I should start with a similar setting, maybe \"m lawmakers\" (a made-up phrase) to mimic the original's \"mome raths.\" \n\nNow, the creature itself: the creep. I need to embody the characteristics of a creep through nonsensical words. In \"Jabberwocky,\" the Jabberwock has \"jaws that bite, claws that catch.\" For the creep, perhaps something like \"frazzled fringe,\" \"wamblethrops\" (a play on \"whiffling\"), and \"squelchούς η 日\" mixing languages for that Carrollian feel. Maybe they leave \"snicklesnores\" (tracks or traces) that are hard to detect.\n\nThe narrative should involve a confrontation, like the battle in \"Jabberwocky.\" The protagonist might outwit the creep. Using verbs like \"vrome\" (a blend of \"vroom\" and \"roam\") and \"jinklewiff\" to create action. Including a vorpal blade reference could be a nice homage, perhaps \"Vorpal Vibes\" as a weapon that disturbs the creature.\n\nI should also include made-up words that hint at the creep's nature: \"mimsy maws\" (weak jaws), \"floopenloops\" (maybe confusing speech or actions), \"flazzlepox\" (a condition the creep might inflict). The creep's movement could be \"galumphing,\" a direct nod to Carroll's term.\n\nThe ending should mirror the victory in \"Jabberwocky,\" but maybe with a twist. Instead of slaying the beast, perhaps the protagonist uses wit or cleverness to escape. Emphasize the lingering presence of the creep, how it haunts the \"tulgey voids\" (a nonsense place) and is feared by \"mome lawmakers,\" adding a layer of societal disregard, which fits the theme of a creep being overlooked or underestimated.\n\nNeed to check the meter. Each line should have eight syllables. Let's test a line: \"Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\" (8 syllables). For my poem, \"Beware the Creep, and shun the frumious fray\" – maybe \"Beware the Creep, and shun the frumious bandersnatch\" to match. Wait, the user wants the poem to focus on creep, so perhaps less direct references to bandersnatch. Let me adjust.\n\nInventing words: \"wumblethwacks,\" \"quokkawumps\" (a mix of quokka andumps?), \"floam\" (foam + loam?), \"blattentweed\" (blatant + weed). The goal is to create a sense of the creature's slimy, sneaky nature through these words.\n\nPutting it all together, ensuring each stanza flows with the AABB rhyme and consistent meter. The poem should have a playful yet cautionary tone, warning about the creep while maintaining the whimsical style of Carroll. Need to avoid being too on-the-nose; the description should be vivid but abstract, letting the nonsense words carry the imagery.\n\nLet me draft the stanzas step by step, checking rhythm and wordplay. Start with the warning, introduce the creature's features, the encounter, the method of overcoming it, and the aftermath. Make sure to include alliteration and assonance where Carroll would. Once drafted, read aloud to ensure the flow matches \"Jabberwocky.\"\n</think>\n\n**The Creepwuzzy**  \n\nBeware the Creep, and shun the frumious bandersnatch—  \nThe m lawmakers dab at froth with twiddlethwacks.  \nBeware the Wumplush stalk and quokkawump’s soft snare,  \nWhere tulgey voids breeds mimsy maws in flazzlepox’d air.  \n\nHe took the Vorpal Vibes (a relic floopenloop’d)  \nAnd burbled through the blight where creepwuzzies drood.  \nLong ’twas the burb, and flum the pazlumps danced in hoops,  \nAs they tithed their whimwhams, “Beware the Creepwuzzy’s cruise!”  \n\nA frumious beast!

{"i": 46, "prompt": "Compose a poem on desire path in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about a \"desire path\" in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a desire path is. From what I know, it's a trail created by people walking where there's no official path, showing the natural flow of human movement. So the poem should reflect that organic, winding journey.\n\nNow, the style of \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll is crucial here. That poem is famous for its neologisms, playful language, and whimsical yet rhythmic structure. I'll need to invent some nonsense words and maintain a consistent meter, probably iambic tetrameter.\n\nStarting with the title. \"Desire Path\" is straightforward, but Carroll often uses alliteration and invented terms. Maybe something like \"Th' Wimmly Wamble's Winding Way\" to capture the whimsy and the idea of a meandering path.\n\nNext, the opening lines. \"Jabberwocky\" begins with a setting that's both vivid and fantastical. I should establish a scene where the path exists, perhaps in a whimsical landscape. Words like \"tulgey\" or \"borogoves\" from the original can inspire similar creations here, like \"flumplenooks\" or \"jinkle-placks.\"\n\nThe poem needs to describe the path's emergence despite obstacles. Using Carroll's technique of blending real and nonsense words can help. For example, \"mome\" means a foolish person, so maybe \"mome rails\" to depict ineffective barriers.\n\nIncluding a narrative element, like a traveler choosing the path, adds depth. The traveler's defiance against straight roads can mirror the theme of desire paths overcoming rigid structures. The contrast between \"frumious\" straight roads and the winding path emphasizes the desire path's nature.\n\nThe middle stanza should highlight the path's persistence. Using verbs like \"frabjul\" and \"gallivant\" creates action and movement. Mentioning \"whiffling will\" gives the path a life of its own, making it an active character in the poem.\n\nIntroducing creatures or challenges along the path, like \"Burbling Bandersnatch\" or \"mimsy maulverines,\" adds the fantastical obstacles found in \"Jabberwocky.\" The traveler's interaction with these challenges shows determination.\n\nThe climax could involve the path leading to a discovery or transformation. Phrases like \"splendiferous sight\" and \"glorified the grimptraps\" suggest a positive outcome from following the desire path.\n\nEnding with a reflection on the path's legacy, using terms like \"outgrib\" and \"grappledYD\" to signify enduring impact, wraps the poem with a sense of timeless relevance.\n\nI need to ensure the rhythm matches \"Jabberwocky,\" which uses a strong, consistent beat. Checking each line's syllable count and stress patterns to maintain the meter. Invented words should flow naturally within the verse, enhancing rather than obstructing the meaning.\n\nFinally, review the poem for coherence and adherence to the original style. Each stanza should build on the metaphor of the desire path, blending nonsense elements with the core theme of organic, determined movement overcoming artificial constraints.\n</think>\n\n**Th' Wimmly Wamble's Winding Way**  \n\n'Twas brillig, and the mome rails  \nDid gyre and gringe in sun;  \nAll flumplenooks the moor did flail,  \nAnd mimsy maulverines were run.  \n\n\"Beware th' Wimmly Wamble, my son!  \nTh' frumious path that frays  \nTh' straight-choked roads where burbling Bandersnatch  \nGallivants in disarray!\"  \n\nHe chortled in his suxxy boots—  \n\"No quake!

{"i": 47, "prompt": "Create a poem about morning fog in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about morning fog in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" Let me recall what \"Jabberwocky\" is like. Carroll uses made-up words, playful language, and a rhythmic structure. The key elements are nonsense verse, alliteration, and whimsical imagery.\n\nSo, morning fog... I need to capture that ethereal, mysterious feel. Use neologisms that sound like real words but aren't. Maybe start with a setting, like a meadow or forest. Incorporate creatures or elements that interact with the fog.\n\nThe title should be catchy and Carroll-esque. \"The Fog That Flew\" or \"Morn's Misty Mizzle.\" Hmm, \"Mizzle\" is a term for a mix of mist and drizzle, which fits. \"The Mizzle's Frumious Play\" – \"frumious\" is from the original Jabberwocky (\"frumious Bandersnatch\"). That adds authenticity.\n\nStructure-wise, use quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. Each stanza should have a strong rhythm. Now, the first stanza sets the scene. Maybe something like:\n\nAs morn's mizzle mumbled low,\nA flibulous fog arose,\nWith glammerglow and whispers wroth,\nIt wove a wamble through the oaks.\n\n\"Flibulous\" and \"glammerglow\" are invented words. \"Wamble\" means to walk unsteadily. The fog is moving through trees.\n\nNext, introduce creatures. In Jabberwocky, there are beasts like the Bandersnatch. Maybe \"snicker-snacks\" or \"slivish toves.\" Here, the fog interacts with them:\n\nThe slivish toves in bracken quailed,\nAs vapory tendrils snickered by,\nTheir flummock tails in scuttle frail,\nDanced to the mizzle's lickerly sigh.\n\n\"Slivish toves\" are from the original. \"Flummock\" and \"lickerly\" are new. The fog's tendrils are moving, causing the creatures to react.\n\nThird stanza: the fog's effect on the environment. Maybe personify the fog as a playful entity:\n\nWith griffin claws of glimmermist,\nIt snatched the sun's rentsplendif gold,\nAnd left the moor in zephyry wrist,\nWhere fulgur blooms young dawn hath sown, yet told.\n\n\"Rentsplendif\" combines \"resplendent\" and \"splendiferous.\" \"Fulgur\" relates to lightning, here maybe glowing blooms. The fog interacts with light.\n\nFourth stanza: the fog departs, leaving mystery. The aftermath:\n\nNow mizzle's gone, the morn's agleam,\nYet in the grass, a glimmer stays—\nA frumious thread of silv'ry dream,\nWhere mizzle danced, and frabbered rays.\n\n\"Frabbered\" from \"frabjous\" in the original. The fog's remnants linger.\n\nCheck for consistent meter and rhyme. Each stanza's rhythm should match, with iambs and trochees. Ensure made-up words fit the mouthfeel of Carroll's language. Avoid clichés, keep imagery fresh. Does this capture the essence of morning fog in a whimsical, Jabberwocky style? Yes, with fantastical creatures, playful language, and the fog's personified actions. Title references \"frumious\" to tie back to the original poem. Looks good.\n</think>\n\n**The Mizzle's Frumious Play**  \n\nAs morn's mizzle mumbled low,  \nA flibulous fog arose,  \nWith glammerglow and whispers wroth,  \nIt wove a wamble through the oaks.  \n\nThe slivish toves in bracken quailed,  \nAs vapory tendrils snickered by,  \nTheir flummock tails in scuttle frail,  \nDanced to the mizzle's lickerly sigh.  \n\nWith griffin claws of glimmermist,  \nIt snatched the sun's rentsplendif gold,  \nAnd left the moor in zephyry wrist,  \nWhere fulgur blooms young dawn hath sown, yet told.  \n\nNow mizzle's gone, the morn's agleam,  \nYet in the grass, a glimmer stays—  \nA frumious thread of silv'ry dream,  \nWhere mizzle danced, and frabbered rays.", "info": {"topic": "morning fog"}, "reward": 0.6111111111111112, "label": "medium", "criteria_yes": 11, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.6111111111111112, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 0.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 1.0, "C13_creature_naming": 0.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 1.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 1.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}}
{"i": 48, "prompt": "Write a poem about third rail hum in the style of Lewis Carroll's 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about the third rail hum in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\". Let me start by recalling what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. Carroll uses nonsense words that sound real, blending them with vivid imagery and playful language. The structure is consistent, with each stanza having a similar rhythm and rhyme scheme.\n\nFirst, I need to capture the essence of the third rail. The third rail is part of electric railway systems, so I should incorporate elements related to trains, electricity, and maybe some industrial or mystical atmosphere. Words like \"hum\", \"current\", \"track\", \"locomotive\" come to mind. I should invent some Carroll-esque terms, maybe \"snickel bourgeoisie\" or \"frumious beam\". \n\nThe poem should have a narrative, like a journey or a quest, similar to \"Jabberwocky\". Maybe the protagonist encounters the third rail's hum and other whimsical obstacles. I need to maintain the ABAB rhyme scheme and anapestic tetrameter. Let me draft some lines:\n\n'Beware the Snickel bourgeoisie,\nThe Frumious Beam that gouges Loop,\nBeware the Track that taunts with glee\nAnd mickle Sparks that fraxle in soot!'\n\nThat's a start. I'll continue building each stanza, ensuring each has the right rhythm and rhyme. Include actions like \"galumphing\", \"whiffling\", and \"burbling\" to mimic Carroll's style. Add some vivid, fantastical imagery related to the railway—maybe \"mournful hum\" and \"glowing rails\". Make sure to give it a title that fits, something like \"The Frumious Third Rail\" to tie in the nonsense words with the theme.\n</think>\n\n**The Frumious Third Rail**  \n\n’Twas mimsy on the tracks that night,  \nAll whimsy-wired, hot with spite,  \nWhen forth a mournful hum did pour—  \nA low, lugubrious, lounging roar!  \nBeware the Snickel bourgeoisie,  \nThe Frumious Beam that gouges Loop,  \nBeware the Track that taunts with glee  \nAnd mickle Sparks that fraxle in soot!  \n\nHe took the Vorpal Volt in hand—  \nA humming maw of livid brand—  \nThrough wabe of tunnels, dark and deep,  \nWhere mome commuters yawned in sleep.  \n“Beware the Rail that thrums,” they cried,  \n“The jabbering current, frith and wide!”  \nBut he, with courage frabjul and bright,  \nGalumphed into the livid light.  \n\nHe whiffling stalked through stations grim,  \nBurbling wires stretched, serpentine slim,  \nTill—Oh!—a glance o’er shouldered rail,  \nA single beam, all thrum and trail,  \nGlowing, aglow, with jaws ajar,  \nThe Third Rail hummed—*“Beware, go far!”*  \nIts vithy coils spun sly, spinny air,  \nAs it burbled, “Frumious?

{"i": 49, "prompt": "Compose a poem on film camera in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nAlright, the user wants a poem about a film camera in the style of \"Jabberwocky.\" Let me start by recalling the original poem's characteristics. \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll is known for its whimsical language, invented words, playful rhythm, and nonsense verses that still convey vivid imagery.\n\nFirst, I need to capture the essence of a film camera. Key elements include the shutter, film roll, developing process, and the nostalgic feel. Now, how to blend these with Carroll's style. \n\nI should invent some portmanteau words. For example, \"whirlibirds\" could mimic the whirring of the shutter. \"Snicker-Snack\" from the original might become \"Shutter's Snicker-Snap\" to tie in the camera's mechanism. \n\nThe structure is important. \"Jabberwocky\" has a consistent meter and rhyme scheme, usually ABAB. I'll need to maintain that. Let me outline the stanzas: introduction of the camera, loading the film, taking a photo, developing, and the result. \n\nFor the title, \"The Frumious Film Camera\" incorporates \"frumious,\" a blend of \"fuming\" and \"furious\" from the original, tying in the camera's function. \n\nNow, drafting each stanza with made-up words but keeping the camera theme. Testing the rhythm to ensure it matches the galloping iambic tetrameter. Words like \"vulptuous vipers\" could represent subjects being photographed, and \"glorpalities\" might evoke the development process. \n\nNeed to ensure each verse flows smoothly and the nonsense words still hint at their meanings. For example, \"galloped\" for the film advancing, \"soda-crack\" referencing chemical development. Ending with the joy of the developed photo, \"foamy maw\" suggesting the revealed image. \n\nCheck for consistency in rhyme and meter. Make adjustments where lines feel forced. Once satisfied, put it all together with the title. Let me review the example response to ensure alignment with these elements.
