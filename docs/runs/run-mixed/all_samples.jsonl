Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about a name badge in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\". Let me start by recalling the key elements of \"Jabberwocky\". It has a lot of made-up words, playful language, a rhythmic and rhythmic structure, and a sense of nonsense that still tells a story.\n\nFirst, I need to come up with a title that sounds like it could fit into Carroll's world. Maybe something like \"The Wuggle's Nametag\" or \"The Fimbulfly's Plaque\". \"Nametag\" is straightforward, but maybe \"The Quizzle's Badge\" or \"The Snicker-Snack's Claim\". Wait, the user specified \"name badge\", so perhaps \"The Frumious Nameplate\" or \"The Jingle-Whiff's Badge\". Hmm.\n\nNext, the poem should follow the AABBCC rhyme scheme and meter. Let's think about the structure. The original has four-line stanzas with alternating rhymes. Each line is about eight syllables. So I need to maintain that.\n\nNow, the theme is a name badge. How to personify it and create a whimsical adventure around it? Maybe the badge is a magical item that the protagonist must obtain or use. Include fantastical creatures and actions. Use Carroll's nonsense words but relate them to the name badge.\n\nStart with a warning, like \"Beware the Name Badge, my son!\" Then describe the journey to acquire it. Introduce creatures like \"Mome Raths\" or \"Jabberwocks\" but adapt them. Maybe \"The pixelated Pooka\" or \"the wifi's frumious beam\". Use tech terms with a Carroll twist since name badges are often part of modern conferences or events.\n\nIncorporate actions: the badge might \"glow\" or \"beam\", need to be \"claimed\" or \"fixed\". The protagonist might outsmart obstacles. End with triumph, showing the badge's importance, perhaps a play on identity or belonging.\n\nCheck for made-up verbs and nouns, alliteration, and internal rhymes. Ensure the rhythm matches the original. Let me draft a stanza:\n\n'Twas brillig and the slithy toves\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe;\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.\n\nAdapted stanza:\n\n'Twas login time and the badges bright\nDid glimmer, gleam with namish might;\nAll pixellate the Pookas spun,\nAnd the Wifi's frumious beam was won.\n\nHmm, maybe \"pixelspun\" instead. Introduce the quest: \"Beware the Name Badge...\" Move through challenges, maybe a \"Flibbertijibbet\" or \"Mimsy Clerk\". The climax where the badge is secured, then a resolution showing the badge's power.\n\nCheck that each stanza follows the meter. Use hyphenated words for effect. Ensure the title is included and the poem stands alone.

It's the nonsense words, playful language, and vivid imagery. So, I should invent some whimsical terms and maintain a rhythmic structure.\n\nBittersweet victory suggests a mix of triumph and sadness. Maybe the protagonist achieves something but at a cost. In 'Jabberwocky', there's a battle against a monster. I could create a similar antagonist, like a symbolic creature representing adversity.\n\nUsing alliteration and made-up words will help mimic the style. Words like \"glibblejaws\" or \"snickerfritz\" might work. The poem needs a title that's catchy and hints at the theme. \"The Frothle's Pyrrhic\" sounds Jabberwocky-esque and alludes to a victory with a downside.\n\nStructure-wise, quatrains with a consistent meter, maybe trochaic tetrameter. Each stanza introduces elements of the journey, the battle, and the hollow victory. Need to ensure the rhythm flows smoothly and the language is both whimsical and meaningful.\n\nLet me draft some lines. Start with setting the scene in a fantastical landscape. Then introduce the conflict, the adversary, and the victory that isn't fully satisfying. Use nonsense verbs and creatures but keep the emotional core relatable. Check that the invented words don't overshadow the message but enhance the style.\n\nRevise for meter and coherence.

{"i": 2, "prompt": "Create a poem about a promise kept in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem in the style of \"Jabberwocky\" about a promise kept. Let me start by recalling what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It's by Lewis Carroll, right? Full of nonsense words, playful language, and a rhythmic structure. So I need to mimic that style.\n\nFirst, the title. \"Jabberwocky\" has a title that sounds whimsical. Maybe something like \"The Galumphing Vow\" to keep that whimsy and incorporate \"vow\" for the promise. \n\nNow, the poem itself. The original has a mix of real and invented words. I should blend nonsense terms with the theme of promises. The structure is quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. Let me check the meter; \"Jabberwocky\" is in iambic tetrameter. So four beats per line, unstressed then stressed syllables.\n\nStarting the first stanza: set a scene, maybe a fantastical scenario. \"Beware the frumious dawn's decree,\" \"frumious\" is from the original, so that's a good nod. Then introduce the promise. \"When momeговы swear by the sea,\" mixing \"mome\" from the original and maybe a Russian word for raven (ворон) but with a twist to make it fit. Wait, the user might not know Russian, but Carroll uses a mix of languages. Maybe \"mome-pigeons\" instead? Hmm.\n\nNext lines: \"A vow was minted, a bond to be free— / 'Tis slithy to break what's sworn to see.\" \"Slithy\" is another Carrollism. The idea is that the vow is strong, and breaking it is difficult or bad.\n\nSecond stanza: Introduce conflict or challenge. \"The jubjub's jagged jaws did gape,\" jubjub is another creature. \"jaws did gape\" creates tension. \"As I traversed the tulgey deep, / Where shadows frothed and waters steep.\" Tulgey wood from the original becomes \"tulgey deep\" with waters. \n\nThird stanza: The promise being tested. \"Yet still I clutched the glowing shard,\" a shard as a symbol of the promise. \"A splendor through barloam dark,\" barloam might be a mix of barometric and loam? Not sure, but sounds good. \"O'er waters writhing, I swam, I slogged, / Through burbles that hissed and fog that bogged.\" \"Burbles\" and \"fog that bogged\" for obstacles.\n\nFourth stanza: The climax of keeping the promise. \"The mimsy moon mocked my plight,\" mimsy from the original. \"As I sledged to the nethermost night,\" sledged as a verb, maybe sliding or struggling. \"No gyre could twist my will to flinch— / The froth drove back with a serpentine cinch!\" Gyre as a spiral, resisting the will. The promise holds despite challenges.\n\nFinal stanza: The resolution and keeping the vow. \"Thus I stood on the gallywump shore,\" gallywump sounds right. \"The vow now glimmering evermore! / For to mith a mooth and keep one's creed / Is to galoomb where the glimmering creeds proceed!\" \"Mith a mooth\" maybe meaning to speak a word? \"Mith\" and \"mooth\" playful. Ending with \"galoomb\" as a celebratory action, moving forward with kept promises.\n\nNow check the rhyme scheme and meter. Each stanza four lines, ABAB rhymes. Iambic tetrameter mostly. Some invented words might be tricky, but that's the style. Make sure the theme of keeping a promise is clear through the challenges and triumph. Okay, time to put it all together with the title.\n</think>\n\n**The Galumphing Vow**  \n\nBeware the frumious dawn’s decree,  \nWhen mome-pigeons swear by the sea,  \nA vow was minted, a bond to be free—  \n’Tis slithy to break what’s sworn to see.  \n\nThe jubjub’s jagged jaws did gape,  \nAs I traversed the tulgey deep,  \nWhere shadows frothed and waters steep.  \nThe snicker-snack of doubt did creep.  \n\nYet still I clutched the glowing shard,  \nA splendor through barloam dark,  \nO’er waters writhing, I swam, I slogged,  \nThrough burbles that hissed and fog that bogged.  \n\nThe mimsy moon mocked my plight,  \nAs I sledged to the nethermost night,  \nNo gyre could twist my will to flinch—  \nThe froth drove back with a serpentine cinch!  \n\nThus I stood on the gallywump shore,  \nThe vow now glimmering evermore!  \nFor to mith a mooth and keep one’s creed  \nIs to galoomb where the glimmering creeds proceed!", "info": {"topic": "a promise kept"}, "reward": 0.3888888888888889, "label": "low", "criteria_yes": 7, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.3888888888888889, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 0.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 0.0, "C5_ring_composition": 0.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 0.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 0.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 0.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 0.0, "label_low": 1.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "model_id": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "model_slug": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1"}

Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants a poem about a paperclip chain in the style of Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\". Let me start by recalling the characteristics of \"Jabberwocky\". It's known for its nonsense words, playful language, and whimsical creatures with made-up names. The rhythm is also quite bouncy, with a consistent meter.\n\nFirst, I need a title that sounds Carroll-esque. Maybe something like \"The Frumious Gripplatch\" or \"The Jaws of Wizzlewhack\". Wait, the user mentioned a paperclip chain. So perhaps the title should incorporate a nonsense word related to chains or links. How about \"The Snicker-Snack of Slippery Links\"? That has a nice ring to it and includes \"slippery\" to evoke the chain's movement.\n\nNow, the structure. \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an ABCB rhyme scheme. Each line has eight syllables, but there's some variation. I need to maintain that structure. Let's start with setting the scene. In \"Jabberwocky\", the first stanza introduces the vorpal blade and the frumious Bandersnatch. So here, maybe introduce the paperclip chain and the task at hand.\n\n\" 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\" becomes something like \"Beneath the burble of the noonday sun\". Then introduce the chain: \"the Slippery Links began\". Use alliteration and invented verbs. Next, the action: the chain grows, it's a marvel. Maybe some creatures interact with it, like the \"Jim-Jam wraiths\" or \"Glibblejaws\".\n\nIn the second stanza, introduce a conflict or a challenge. In \"Jabberwocky\", the protagonist must beware the Jabberwock. Here, maybe the chain encounters a \"Wizzlethorn\" or \"Flishybloom\". Then the chain overcomes the obstacle, twisting and turning. Use terms like \"thickthumned\" to describe the chain's persistence.\n\nThird stanza: the chain's growth continues, outwitting foes. Introduce more whimsical creatures like \"Floopensteeds\" or \"Snicker-Snack\". Use onomatopoeia where possible, like \"crivvens\" or \"wug\". Emphasize the chain's relentless progression.\n\nFourth stanza: the aftermath, the chain's triumph. Maybe it engulfs the landscape or transforms the environment. \"Gallimaufry\" is a term from Carroll, meaning a dish of many ingredients. Use it to describe the chain's intertwining. End with a sigh and the vanishing of the chain, leaving only a single paperclip.\n\nCheck the rhyme scheme and syllable count. Each stanza should have four lines with the ABCB rhyme. Ensure the language is playful with portmanteaus and invented words. Avoid modern terms, stay true to Carroll's archaic and whimsical style. Read it aloud to test the rhythm. Make adjustments where the flow is off. Ensure that the paperclip chain is the central element, transforming and interacting with the fantastical world.\n</think>\n\n**The Fracklesnorp’s Frolic**  \n\n‘Twas brillig on the desktop plain,  \nWith mimsy clips in silken sheen,  \nWhen bikelians danced in vain—  \nA paperchain of frolicking green.  \n\n“Beware the Jabborflange’s maw!”  \nThe Frumious Clip warn’t in its song,  \nAs twists throttled, loop by loop raw,  \nThrough CPUs where Flishybloom throng.  \n\nIt glimmer’d in the LCD glade,  \nOutgribing Foozles left and rights,  \nTill clashing with a Spoolthraze blade,  \nIt throttled foes in obsessive knots by night.  \n\nYet frabjulons mourn’d its sharp descent—  \nA shivvering coil of tin and will,  \nEroded by the Glibblejaws’ lament…  \nNow naught remains but one slim, still  \nClip, grinning at the momish dawn—  \n‘Til next it slinks, and chains are spawned.", "info": {"topic": "paperclip chain"}, "reward": 0.7222222222222222, "label": "medium", "criteria_yes": 13, "metrics": {"composite_score": 0.7222222222222222, "C1_title_present": 1.0, "C2_quatrain_shape": 1.0, "C3_ballad_meter_echo": 1.0, "C4_ballad_rhyme": 1.0, "C5_ring_composition": 1.0, "C6_warning_admonition": 1.0, "C7_preparation_armament": 0.0, "C8_encounter_confrontation": 1.0, "C9_slaying_decisive_action": 1.0, "C10_return_celebration": 0.0, "C11_coinage_count": 1.0, "C12_coinage_spread": 0.0, "C13_creature_naming": 1.0, "C14_onomatopoeia": 0.0, "C15_alliteration_consonance": 1.0, "C16_tone_alignment": 1.0, "C17_no_verbatim_lines": 1.0, "C18_canonical_budget": 0.0, "label_high": 0.0, "label_medium": 1.0, "label_low": 0.0, "label_very_low": 0.0}, "model_id": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "model_slug": "llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1", "provider": "openrouter", "model": "nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1"}
{"i": 4, "prompt": "Compose a poem on control theory in the style of 'Jabberwocky'. Include a title. Output only the titled poem.", "poem": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this request. The user wants a poem about control theory in the style of \"Jabberwocky\" with a title. First, I need to recall what \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll is like. It's known for its nonsensical words, playful language, and a rhythmic, lyrical flow that mimics a serious narrative but uses made-up terms. The challenge here is to blend technical terms from control theory with the whimsical style of \"Jabberwocky.\"\n\nControl theory involves concepts like feedback loops, stability, systems, Bode plots, Nyquist criteria, Lyapunov functions, etc. I need to incorporate these terms in a way that sounds like the original poem's invented language. Maybe create portmanteaus or playful variations of these terms, like \"Flibbertijibits\" or \"Mome Raths\" from the original.\n\nThe original poem also has a clear structure with quatrains, an ABAB rhyme scheme, and a consistent meter, mainly iambic tetrameter. I should stick to that structure. Let me start by brainstorming some lines that introduce the topic with a sense of adventure or quest, similar to \"Jabberwocky.\"\n\nFor the title, something like \"The Vorpal Controller\" might work, referencing the \"vorpal sword\" from the original. Then, the first stanza could set the scene in a fantastical world where control theory elements exist. Maybe mention the \"slithy toves\" but replace them with terms like \"slithy gains\" or \"gyrating phase.\"\n\nNext, introduce the protagonist's mission: to stabilize a system. Use terms like \"frumious Bode plots\" and \"burble\" for noise or disturbances. Incorporate actions like tweaking gains and battling \"the Jabberloop\" (a play on feedback loops). \n\nInclude obstacles like \"mimsy Nyquist\" and \"mome Routh array,\" referencing Nyquist stability criterion and Routh-Hurwitz. mention tools like \"sulky Lyapunov\" functions.

Let me start by recalling what makes \"Jabberwocky\" unique. It's full of neologisms, playful language, and a rhythmic, nonsense verse structure. The poem uses made-up words that sound meaningful, contributing to its whimsical feel.\n\nFirst, I need a title that fits the \"Jabberwocky\" style. Maybe something alliterative and a bit nonsensical, like \"The Whimwham Zephyr's Lullaby\" or \"Sunset Sough of Wuggle Plain\". Wait, \"Wug\" and \"Glint\" from the original could be inspiration. Let me try \"The Wugblatt's Lament\" or \"Glint of Eve\". Maybe \"The Evening Breeze\" is too straightforward. Let me think of a more whimsical title.\n\nNext, the poem needs a narrative structure, perhaps with a quest or encounter, like the Jabberwock itself. The evening breeze could be a character or a force the protagonist interacts with. Incorporating nonsense creatures and verbs. Words like \"galumphing\", \"frumious\", \"whiffling\" from the original can be emulated with new creations.\n\nConsider the rhythm and meter. \"Jabberwocky\" is in trochaic tetrameter, so I should maintain that. Each line should have eight syllables with a strong-weak pattern. Let me draft the first line. Instead of \"Twas brillig and the slithy toves\", maybe \"Twas glimmer on the wuggle wold,\" where \"wuggle wold\" evokes a playful landscape.\n\nFor the evening breeze, personify it as a creature or a force. Maybe \"Beware the Whimwham in the West\" as a warning, similar to \"Beware the Jabberwock\". Then describe its effects: rustling leaves, whispering through trees. Use alliteration and assonance.\n\nInclude some made-up words that hint at their meaning. For example, \"sundering\" could be a verb for parting, \"loamflung\" for something related to soil. The poem should have a dreamlike quality, mixing real and imaginary elements.\n\nStructurally, \"Jabberwocky\" has quatrains with an ABAB rhyme scheme. I'll follow that. Let me outline the stanzas. Start with setting the scene, introduce the breeze as a character, describe its actions, and conclude with the aftermath.\n\nCheck for consistency in the invented language. Words should be consistent in their sounds and apparent meanings. Avoid being too obscure, but maintain the whimsy.
